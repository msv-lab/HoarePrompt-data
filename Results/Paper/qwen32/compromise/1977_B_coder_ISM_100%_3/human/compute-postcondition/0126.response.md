Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is incremented by 1, and `i` is 1. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and `s[i+1]` was '1', then `s[1]` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, `s` remains the 30-bit binary representation of `x`. If `flag` was 1 and `s[1]` was '0', then `s[1]` is now '1'.**
