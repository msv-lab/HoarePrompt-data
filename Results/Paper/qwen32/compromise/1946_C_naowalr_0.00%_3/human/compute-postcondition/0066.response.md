The code snippet provided sets `numCuts` to 0. This means the value of `numCuts` changes from its previous value to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001**.
