To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while R - L > 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `R - L > 1`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that this condition remains true.

Given the current state:
- `R` is either 25001 or 75001.
- `L` is either 1 or 50001 but not both `L` and `R` are 50001.

Let's analyze the possible values of `R` and `L`:

1. If `R = 25001` and `L = 1`, then `R - L = 25000`, which satisfies `R - L > 1`.
2. If `R = 25001` and `L = 50001`, then `R - L = -25000`, which does not satisfy `R - L > 1`.
3. If `R = 75001` and `L = 1`, then `R - L = 75000`, which satisfies `R - L > 1`.
4. If `R = 75001` and `L = 50001`, then `R - L = 25000`, which satisfies `R - L > 1`.

From the above analysis, we see that the only combination that does not satisfy `R - L > 1` is when `R = 25001` and `L = 50001`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to avoid this combination.

Therefore, we need to adjust the values of `R` and `L` such that `R - L > 1` holds true. One way to do this is to ensure that `R` is always greater than `L + 1`.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in an undirected graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` is greater than 0; `i` ranges from 0 to `n-2` during the loop's execution; `a` and `b` are pairs of integers read from the input representing edges in the graph; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is either 25001 or 75001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is either 25001 or 75001; otherwise, `L` is either 1 or 50001 but not both `L` and `R` are 50001; `R` is either 25001 or 75001; `R` must be greater than `L + 1`**
