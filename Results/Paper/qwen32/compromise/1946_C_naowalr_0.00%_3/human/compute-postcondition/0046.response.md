The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The values of `L`, `R`, and `z` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k` and `leftover >= L` is not satisfied, `R` is `L + 1`, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input.**
