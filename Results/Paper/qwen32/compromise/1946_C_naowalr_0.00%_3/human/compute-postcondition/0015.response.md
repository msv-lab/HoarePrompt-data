The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This means that the list at index `b` in the `adj` list now includes `a` as an additional element.

Given the initial state:
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.

After executing `adj[b].append(a)`, the list `adj[b]` will have `a` added to it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` includes `b` (and potentially `a` duplicated in `adj[b]`), and `adj[b]` now includes `a`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
