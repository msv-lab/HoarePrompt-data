Postcondition: **`L` is either 50001 or 75001, and `R` is either 75001, 62501, 87501, 25001, 12501, or 37501 if `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`). Otherwise, `L` is 75001, 62501, 87501, 25001, 12501, or 37501, and `R` is either 100001 or 75001, or `L` is 1 or 25001, and `R` is 50001 or 25001. `z` is incremented by 1. `x` is 75001, 62501, 87501, 25001, 12501, or 37501. `n` is an integer greater than 1. `k` is the second integer read from input. `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node. `i` is equal to `n - 1`. `numCuts` is 0. `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.**
