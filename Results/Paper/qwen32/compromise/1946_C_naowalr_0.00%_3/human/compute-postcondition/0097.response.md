To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n - 1)`, so we only need to adjust the variable `i`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the standard input.
- `adj[a]` includes `b`.
- `adj[b]` includes `a`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`) do not change based on the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the standard input, `adj[a]` includes `b`, `adj[b]` includes `a`**
