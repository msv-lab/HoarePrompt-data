The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input, but their specific values are not provided. After executing the code, the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` includes `b` and `adj[b]` includes `a` with `a` potentially duplicated in `adj[b]`; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**

In simpler terms, the output state remains the same except that `a` and `b` now hold the values of the two integers read from the input. All other variables retain their initial values.
