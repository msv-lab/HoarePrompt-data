The given code snippet initializes an adjacency list `adj` with `n + 1` empty lists. This operation does not affect the values of `L`, `R`, `z`, `n`, or `k`. 

Output State: **`L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k` and `leftover >= L` is not satisfied, `R` is `L + 1`, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists.**
