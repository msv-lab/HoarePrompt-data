The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Given that `adj[a]` already includes `b`, the only change is the addition of `a` to `adj[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from the standard input, `adj[a]` includes `b`, `adj[b]` includes `a`**.
