The given code snippet initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `L`, `R`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `numCuts` is 0**.
