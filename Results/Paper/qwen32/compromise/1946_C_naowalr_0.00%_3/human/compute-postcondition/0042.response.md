Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in an undirected graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` is greater than 0; `i` ranges from 0 to `n-2` during the loop's execution; `a` and `b` are pairs of integers read from the input representing edges in the graph; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is set to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is set to `x`. In both cases, `L` and `R` remain such that `R` is greater than `L + 1`.**
