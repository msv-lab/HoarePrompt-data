The code appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. This means that the list `adj[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` includes `b` (and potentially `a` duplicated in `adj[b]`); `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
