Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in an undirected graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` is greater than 0; `i` ranges from 0 to `n-2` during the loop's execution; `a` and `b` are pairs of integers read from the input representing edges in the graph; `L` is 1; `R` is 50001; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `R` was updated to the value of `x`, which is 50001. All other variables retain their initial values as they were not modified by the given code snippet.
