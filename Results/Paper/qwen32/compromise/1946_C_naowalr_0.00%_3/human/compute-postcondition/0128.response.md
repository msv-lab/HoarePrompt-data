The code snippet reassigns the variable `leftover` to the value returned by the function call `dfs(1, 1)`. This means that the previous value of `leftover` is no longer relevant, and it now holds whatever value `dfs(1, 1)` returns.

The values of `i`, `adj`, `x`, `numCuts`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the function `dfs(1, 1)`. Since there is no indication that `dfs(1, 1)` modifies these variables, we assume they retain their original values.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers representing the connections read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0; if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k`, or if `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is set to 25001 and `R` is set to 50001. Otherwise, `L` is set to 1 and `R` is set to 25001.**
