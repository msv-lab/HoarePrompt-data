Output State: **`L` is either 50001 or 75001, and `R` is either 100001 or 75001, or `L` is 1 or 25001, and `R` is 50001 or 25001; `z` is incremented by 1; `x` is 75001, 62501, 87501, 25001, 12501, or 37501; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is the second integer read from input; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `leftover` is updated to hold the result of the function call `dfs(1, 1)`. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given line of code.
