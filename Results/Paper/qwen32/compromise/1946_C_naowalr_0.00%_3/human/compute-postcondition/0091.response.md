The provided code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variables that will be affected are `n` and `k`. Since the exact values of `n` and `k` depend on the input, we cannot specify their exact values here. However, we know that `n` will be an integer greater than 1 (as per the precondition), and `k` will be the second integer read from the input.

Output State: **`L` is the final value that satisfies the condition, `R` is `L + 1`, `z` is incremented by the number of iterations + 1, `n` is the first integer read from input and is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**
