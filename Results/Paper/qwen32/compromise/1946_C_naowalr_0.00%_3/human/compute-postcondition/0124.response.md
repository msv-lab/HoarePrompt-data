Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers representing the connections read from the input, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0; if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k`, or if `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is set to 25001 and `R` is set to 50001. Otherwise, `L` is set to 1 and `R` is set to 25001.**
