The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n - 1`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again, making it `i + 1`.

Given that the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1` as long as `i + 1 < n - 1`.

State: **`L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k` and `leftover >= L` is not satisfied, `R` is `L + 1`, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `b` now includes `a` in addition to its previous elements, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `i` is incremented by 1**
