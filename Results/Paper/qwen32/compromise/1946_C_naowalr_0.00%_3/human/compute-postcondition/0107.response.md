The code assigns the value `int(100000.0 + 1)` to the variable `R`. Since `100000.0 + 1` equals `100001.0`, converting it to an integer results in `100001`. The variables `i`, `adj`, and `L` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers representing the connections read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001**.
