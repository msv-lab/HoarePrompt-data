To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition `R - L > 1`. The variables `R` and `L` are the only ones mentioned in the loop condition.

Given:
- `L` is initialized to 1.
- `R` is initialized to 100001.

Let's analyze the condition `R - L > 1`:

- Initially, `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`, which is indeed greater than 1.

Since the condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied with the initial values of `R` and `L`, no adjustments are needed to make the loop execute the first time.

Therefore, the state remains the same as provided.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in an undirected graph; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` ranges from 0 to `n-2` during the loop's execution; `a` and `b` are pairs of integers read from the input representing edges in the graph; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0**
