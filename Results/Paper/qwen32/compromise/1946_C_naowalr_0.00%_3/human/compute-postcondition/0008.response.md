The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` includes `b` and `adj[b]` includes `a`; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
