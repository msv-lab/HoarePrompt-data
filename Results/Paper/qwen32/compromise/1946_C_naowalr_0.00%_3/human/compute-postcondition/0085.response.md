Output State: **`L` is either 50001 or 75001, and `R` is 75001, 62501, 87501, 25001, 12501, or 37501; `z` is incremented by 1; `x` is 75001, 62501, 87501, 25001, 12501, or 37501; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is the second integer read from input; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

In simple terms, the value of `R` is now set to the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
