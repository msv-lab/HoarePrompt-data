Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` remains the first integer read from the input, `a` remains the list of `n` integers read from the input, `l` remains a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`, `ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop broke or less than `k * 2` if the loop completed all iterations, `ur` remains 0, and `res` remains an empty list. If `k` is non-zero, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, `re` is the number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed, and `res` contains the elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1, up to `k` elements. If `k` is zero, no further changes occur to `k`, `re`, or `res`.**
