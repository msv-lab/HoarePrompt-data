To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`.
- `re` is initialized to 0.
- `ul` is set to 2 if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` or if `ul` was already `k * 2`; otherwise, `ul` is set to 0.
- `ur` is initialized to 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `i` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
- `i` is set to `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is set to `n` in the initial state.
- Since `a` is a list of `n` integers, the valid indices for `a` are from `0` to `n-1`.
- `a[n]` would actually be out of bounds for the list `a` because the maximum valid index is `n-1`.

Given that `i` is set to `n`, `a[i]` would be `a[n]`, which is an out-of-bounds access. This would typically result in an `IndexError` in Python. However, the problem statement suggests we should describe the output based on the precondition, so we need to infer what would be printed if the code were to execute without error.

### Hypothetical Execution:
If we hypothetically assume that `i` was set to `n-1` instead of `n` (which would be a more logical and error-free scenario), then:
- `a[i]` would be `a[n-1]`, which is the last element of the list `a`.

Given this hypothetical scenario, the print statement would print the last element of `a` twice, followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Since the problem specifies the state with `i` set to `n`, which is out-of-bounds, the actual execution would result in an error. However, based on the precondition and the hypothetical scenario where `i` is `n-1`, the output would be:

Output: **a[n-1] a[n-1] ** (where `a[n-1]` is the last element of the list `a`)
