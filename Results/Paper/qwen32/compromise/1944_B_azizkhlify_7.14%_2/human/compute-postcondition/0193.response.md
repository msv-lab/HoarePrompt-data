The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n` and `2 * n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ul` and `ur` are not equal unless the loop or if statement was broken out of, in which case `ul` and `ur` are equal and `i` is `i + 1`. Since we are considering the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was less than `2 * n` for the loop to have executed. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the if condition was met and the loop or if statement was broken out of, in which case `ul` and `ur` are equal. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the loop or if statement was broken out of and `i` is `i + 1`. `i` is incremented by 1.**

To be more specific:
State: **`ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the if condition was met and the loop or if statement was broken out of, in which case `ul` and `ur` are equal. `n` is a non-negative integer. `i` is incremented by 1.**
