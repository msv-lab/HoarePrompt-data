Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `ul` is defined based on a condition involving `k * 2` and `n`.
- `ur` is defined based on the value of an element in the list `r`.
- `re` counts unique elements with a count of 1 in the list `a` up to `k` or `n` iterations.
- `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `res` are unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

### Print Statement:
```
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end due to `end=' '`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before this print statement, so we need to consider the value of `a[i]` at the current `i` before the increment.

### Output:
- Since `i` is incremented before the `print` statement, the `print` statement will use the value of `a[i]` at the index `i` before the increment.
- Let's denote the value of `a[i]` at the index `i` before the increment as `a[i]_pre`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]_pre` twice, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i]_pre a[i]_pre (where a[i]_pre is the value of a[i] before i is incremented)**
