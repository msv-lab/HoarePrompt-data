Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ul` and `ur` are variables with values such that `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the if condition was met and the loop or if statement was broken out of, in which case `ul` and `ur` are equal. `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ur` is increased by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the if condition was met and the loop or if statement was broken out of, in which case `ul` and `ur` are equal. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the loop or if statement was broken out of and `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ul` is equal to `ur` if the if condition was met and the loop or if statement was broken out of. `n` is a non-negative integer. `i` is incremented by 1. If `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, then `ur` is incremented by 2, and if the if condition was met, `ul` is also incremented by 2. If the if condition was not met, `ul` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
