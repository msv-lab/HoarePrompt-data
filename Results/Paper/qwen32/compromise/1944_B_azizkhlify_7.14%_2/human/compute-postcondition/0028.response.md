Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` remains the second integer read from the input, `a` remains the list of `n` integers read from the input, `l` remains a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`, `re` remains 0, `ul` is 2 if `ul == k * 2`, otherwise `ul` remains 0, `ur` remains 0, and `res` remains an empty list. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
