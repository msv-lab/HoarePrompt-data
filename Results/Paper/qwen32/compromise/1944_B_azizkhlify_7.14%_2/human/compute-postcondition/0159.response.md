Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `re` and `res` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the variables `t`, `n`, and `i` retain their initial values. The variables `re` and `res` are not modified by the `break` statement. The execution is terminated at the point of the `break` statement, exiting the most internal loop or if statement.
