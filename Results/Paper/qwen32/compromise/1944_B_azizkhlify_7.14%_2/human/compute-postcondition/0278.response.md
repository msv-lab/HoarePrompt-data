To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop is:
```python
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')
```

This loop iterates over each element in the list `res` and prints it. The loop will continue until all elements in `res` have been printed.

From the provided output states, we can deduce the following:
- After 1 iteration, `res` contains at least one element.
- After 2 iterations, `res` contains at least two elements.
- After 3 iterations, `res` contains at least three elements.

This implies that the loop will continue until all elements in `res` have been processed.

After all iterations, the loop will have printed all elements in `res`, and the loop variable `i` will have taken the value of the last element in `res`.

The other variables (`ul`, `ur`, `re`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations; otherwise, `2 * n`. `ur` is 0. `re` is the number of unique elements with count 1 found in `a` up to `k` or `n` iterations. `n` is unchanged. `k` is unchanged. `a` is unchanged. `l` is unchanged. `r` is unchanged. `res` is unchanged. `i` is the last element in `res`.**

In natural language: After all iterations, the loop will have printed all elements in `res`, and the variable `i` will hold the value of the last element in `res`. All other variables will remain in their initial states.
