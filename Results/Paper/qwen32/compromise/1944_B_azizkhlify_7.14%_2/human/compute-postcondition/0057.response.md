Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is now `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero, `a` remains the list of `n` integers read from the input, `l` remains a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`, `ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop broke or less than `k * 2` if the loop completed all iterations, `ur` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, then `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` now includes `a[i]` as its last element.**
