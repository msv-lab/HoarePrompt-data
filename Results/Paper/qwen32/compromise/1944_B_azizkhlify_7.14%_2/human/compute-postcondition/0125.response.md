Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is a list where each index `j` contains the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `k` is the second integer from the input, `re` is 0, `i` is 0, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ul` has been incremented by 2, making it equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
