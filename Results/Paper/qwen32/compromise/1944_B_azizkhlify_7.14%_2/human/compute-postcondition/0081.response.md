Output State: **`r` is a list, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `a`, and the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is 2; `ur` is increased by 2.**

Natural language: The value of `ur` has been increased by 2. All other variables (`r`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged, and the condition that the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is 2 still holds.
