Postcondition: **If `ul` is not equal to `ur` initially, the loop will terminate when `ul` equals `ur`. During any iteration, if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, both `ul` and `ur` will be incremented by 2. The exact final values of `ul` and `ur` will depend on the specific values of `a[i]` and `r[a[i] - 1]`. If `ul` is initially equal to `ur`, no changes are made to `ul` and `ur`.**
