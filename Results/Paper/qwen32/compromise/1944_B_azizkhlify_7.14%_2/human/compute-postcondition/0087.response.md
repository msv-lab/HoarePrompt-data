To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the print statement itself.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`r`**: A list, but its contents are not specified.
2. **`a`**: A list of integers.
3. **`i`**: A variable that has been incremented by 1 from its previous value. This means that `i` currently holds the index that is one more than its previous value.
4. **`n`**: The value of `n` is the same as before, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```
- **`a[i]`**: This is the element at index `i` in the list `a`.
- Since `i` has been incremented by 1, `a[i]` refers to the element at the current index `i` in the list `a`.

### Output Explanation:
- The print statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end (due to `end=' '`).

### Final Output:
Given that the exact contents of the list `a` and the value of `i` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the list `a` and the index `i`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
