To determine the output of the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and deduce the value of `i`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (not directly relevant to the current `print` statement).
2. **`n`**: The first integer read from the input, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
3. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers read from the input.
4. **`l`**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`.
5. **`r`**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`. However, the description of `r` seems inconsistent with the provided information, as `a` only has `n` elements. This might be a misinterpretation or a typo, so we will focus on `l` for now.
6. **`ul`**: Either `k * 2` if the loop broke or less than `k * 2` if the loop completed all iterations.
7. **`ur`**: Remains 0 (not directly relevant to the current `print` statement).
8. **`res`**: A list containing at least one element. This list seems to store some results that are relevant to the loop.
9. **`k`**: Updated to `2 * k - ul` if non-zero.
10. **`re`**: The number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed.
11. **`i`**: The next element in `res`.

### Focused Analysis:
The `print(i, end=' ')` statement directly prints the value of `i` followed by a space. The value of `i` is defined as the next element in the list `res`. Since `res` is described as a list containing at least one element, `i` will be the first element of `res` if this is the first iteration of printing, or the subsequent elements in subsequent iterations.

### Output:
Since the exact contents of `res` are not specified, we can only describe `i` in terms of its position in `res`. The most precise description we can provide is that `i` is the next element in the list `res`.

Output: **i (where i is the next element in the list `res`)**
