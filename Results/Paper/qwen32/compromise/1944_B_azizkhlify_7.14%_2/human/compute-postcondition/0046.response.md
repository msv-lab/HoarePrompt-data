To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `i` is used.

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on typical usage in loops, `i` is usually an index used to iterate through the list `a`.
   - The statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` suggests that `i` is an index that points to an element in the list `a`.

3. **List `l`**:
   - `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`.
   - Given that `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1, this suggests that each element in `a` appears exactly once, making `l` a frequency list where each element in `a` maps to a unique index in `l`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `t`, `n`, `k`, `ul`, `ur`, `res` are defined but not directly relevant to the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement.
   - `r` is also defined but its definition is not relevant to the current print statement.

### Conclusion:

Since `i` is an index used to access elements of the list `a`, and no specific value is given for `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of the element at index `i` in the list `a`.

### Output:

Output: **a[i] (where i is an index in the list a)**

This means the code will print the element at the index `i` of the list `a`, followed by a space, without a newline character at the end.
