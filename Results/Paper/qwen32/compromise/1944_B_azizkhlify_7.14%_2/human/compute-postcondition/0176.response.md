To determine the output of the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which the variable `i` is used.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (This variable does not seem to be directly related to the print statement).
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than or equal to 1.
3. **`a`**: A list of integers.
4. **`l`**: A list where each index `j` contains the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`.
5. **`r`**: A list of `n` zeros with the value at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
6. **`ul`**: The sum of 2 for each time `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` occurred up to the point where the loop breaks or all iterations are completed.
7. **`ur`**: Initialized to 0.
8. **`res`**: Must contain at least one element.
9. **`k`**: Either a non-zero integer (if the if part was executed) or retains its value (if the else part was executed, which is not applicable here as there is no else part).
10. **`re`**: The count of elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes.
11. **`i`**: The next element in `res`.

### Analysis:

- The variable `i` is defined as the next element in the list `res`.
- Since `res` must contain at least one element, `i` will be the first element of `res`.

### Conclusion:

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of the list `res` followed by a space. Since the exact elements of `res` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the first element of `res`.

Output: **[first element of res] (where [first element of res] is the first element in the list `res`)**
