To determine the output of the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. This variable seems to be related to the number of test cases or iterations but is not directly relevant to the current print statement.
2. `n` is a positive integer. This variable indicates the length of the list `a`.
3. `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero. The value of `k` and `ul` are related but do not directly influence the print statement.
4. `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input. This is the list from which elements are being printed.
5. `l` and `r` are lists of `n` integers that have been constructed based on the occurrences of elements in `a`, but they are not directly involved in the print statement.
6. `ul` and `ur` are variables that track some form of count or limit, but they do not affect the print statement.
7. `re` and `res` are variables that remain unchanged and are not relevant to the print statement.
8. `i` is an index that is incremented by 1, indicating that it is likely part of a loop that iterates over the elements of `a`.

The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`, followed by a space, without a newline.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the output will be the element at the current index `i` of the list `a`.

Since the exact value of `i` and the contents of the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the current index `i` and the list `a`.

Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
