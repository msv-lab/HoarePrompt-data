To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `cnt` is calculated.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: This variable is described as `t - 1` and must be greater than 0. This implies that `t` was initially some value greater than 1, and it is decremented by 1, but it must remain greater than 0.
2. **`n`**: This is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
3. **`a`**: This is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting an input line. Let's denote this list as `[a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]]` since `n` is the length of the list.
4. **`b`**: This is another list of integers obtained by splitting and converting a new input line. Similarly, we can denote this list as `[b[0], b[1], ..., b[n-1]]`.
5. **`cnt`**: This variable keeps track of the total number of times the condition `b[j] < a[i]` was true during a loop.
6. **`i`**: This variable keeps track of the total number of times the condition `b[j] >= a[i]` was true during the loop.

### Loop Context:
The loop in question involves comparing each element of list `b` with each element of list `a`. The exact loop structure is not provided, but based on the description, it is likely a nested loop that iterates over both lists `a` and `b`.

### Calculation of `cnt`:
- `cnt` is incremented each time `b[j] < a[i]` is true.
- `i` is incremented each time `b[j] >= a[i]` is true.

### Output Statement:
The `print(cnt)` statement will output the value of `cnt` after the loop has completed.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the given information, `cnt` is the count of times an element in `b` is less than an element in `a` during the loop.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the total number of times b[j] < a[i] was true during the loop)**
