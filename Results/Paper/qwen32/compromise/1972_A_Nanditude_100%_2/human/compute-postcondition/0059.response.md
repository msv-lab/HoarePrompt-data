Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `i` is 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `i` is 2, `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
