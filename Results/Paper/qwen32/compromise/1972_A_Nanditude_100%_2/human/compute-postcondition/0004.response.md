The code snippet provided reads a new line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `b`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state will include the new variable `b` with its specific value, while `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line.**
