The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `j` is 2. If `b[j] < a[i]`, then `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.**
