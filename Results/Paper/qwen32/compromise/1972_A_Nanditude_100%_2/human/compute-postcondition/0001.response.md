The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0**
