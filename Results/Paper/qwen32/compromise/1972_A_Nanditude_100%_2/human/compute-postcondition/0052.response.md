Postcondition: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is 0, and `i` is 0. Additionally, the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`.**
