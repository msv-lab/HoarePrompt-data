In the given task, the variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. To determine if the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variable `t` because `i` is the loop variable that gets initialized within the `range(t)` function.

The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The values of `start` and `end` do not affect the execution of the loop as they are not part of the loop head. Therefore, we only need to adjust `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
