Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was 2, `no` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the final iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num` is `i` if `i` is not in `no`; otherwise, `num` remains 0. `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is a list with at least one element, `less` is a list with at least one element where `min(less) > max(big)`, `no` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the final iteration. If `i` is not in `no`, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is `i` if `i` is not in `no`; otherwise, `num` remains 0. `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `loop` is unchanged. `innerLoop` is greater than 0. `big` is a list with at least one element. `less` is a list with at least one element where `min(less) > max(big)`. `no` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was neither 1 nor 2. `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the final iteration. If `i` is not in `no`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is `i` if `i` is not in `no`; otherwise, `num` remains 0. `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `loop` is unchanged. `innerLoop` is greater than 0. `big` is a list with at least one element. `less` is a list with at least one element where `min(less) > max(big)`. `no` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was neither 1 nor 2. `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the final iteration. `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `no`, the most internal loop is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
