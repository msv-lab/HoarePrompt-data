The value of `num` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is 1, `iterable` is `iterable + innerLoop`, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `big` is `[1]`, `less` is `[2]`, `no` contains all `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `i` is 1**.
