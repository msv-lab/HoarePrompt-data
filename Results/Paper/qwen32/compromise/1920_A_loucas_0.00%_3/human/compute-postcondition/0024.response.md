Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `loop` is greater than 0; `iterable` is 0; `num` is 0; `innerLoop` is greater than 0; `x` is the first integer from the new input; `a` is the second integer from the new input; `iterable2` is 1. If the new `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the old input and `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If the new `x` is 2, `less` contains the value of `a` and `big` is a list containing the second integer from the new input if the old `x` was 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list. If the new `x` is any other value, `no` contains the value of `a` and possibly other elements based on the previous value of `x`, and `big` and `less` are lists based on the previous value of `x`.**
