Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is a list with at least one element, `less` is a list with at least one element where `min(less) > max(big)`, `no` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the final iteration, and `i` is not in `no`.**
