The code snippet `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `no` was initially an empty list, it will now contain `a` as its first and only element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is the first integer from input, `a` is the second integer from input, `x` is not equal to 1, and `x` is not equal to 2.**
