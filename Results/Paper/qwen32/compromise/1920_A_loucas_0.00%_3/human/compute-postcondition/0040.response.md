Output State: **`big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `num` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `big`, `less`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged. The only impact of the code is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
