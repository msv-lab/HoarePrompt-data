Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `a` is the second integer from the input.**

Natural Language: The list `no` now contains the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
