The code snippet `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Given the initial state, `no` is a list that could be empty or contain specific elements depending on the value of `x` from the previous input. After the append operation, `no` will definitely include the value of `a`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500.
- `loop` remains greater than 0.
- `iterable` remains 0.
- `num` remains 0.
- `innerLoop` remains greater than 0.
- `x` remains the first integer from the new input.
- `a` remains the second integer from the new input.
- `no` now includes the value of `a`, regardless of its previous state.
- `big` and `less` remain as they were before, based on the value of `x` from the previous input.
- `iterable2` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `loop` is greater than 0; `iterable` is 0; `num` is 0; `innerLoop` is greater than 0; `x` is the first integer from the new input; `a` is the second integer from the new input; `no` is a list containing the value of `a` and possibly other elements based on the previous value of `x`; `big` and `less` are lists based on the previous value of `x`; `iterable2` is 1.**
