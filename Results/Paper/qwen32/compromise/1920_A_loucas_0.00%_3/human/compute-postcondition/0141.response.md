Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `num` is set to 1.
- `iterable` is defined as `iterable + innerLoop`, but the initial values of `iterable` and `innerLoop` are not specified.
- `loop` is unchanged, but its initial value is not specified.
- `innerLoop` is unchanged, but its initial value is not specified.
- `iterable2` is defined as `innerLoop - 1`, but the initial value of `innerLoop` is not specified.
- `big` is a list containing the integer 1.
- `less` is a list containing the integer 2.
- `no` contains all `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, but the context of `x` and `a` is not provided, so we can't determine the exact contents of `no`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(num)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is only concerned with the value of the variable `num`. According to the initial state, `num` is explicitly set to 1.

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `num`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
