Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `loop` is greater than 0; `iterable` is 0; `num` is 0; `innerLoop` is greater than 0; `x` is the first integer from the new input; `a` is the second integer from the new input; `iterable2` is 2; `no` contains the value of `a`; `big` and `less` are lists based on the previous value of `x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `no.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `no`. The values of other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.
