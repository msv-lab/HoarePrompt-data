Output State: **`num` is `i`, `iterable` is `iterable + innerLoop`, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `big` is [1], `less` is [2], `no` contains all `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `i` is not in `no`.**

In this output state, `num` has been updated to the value of `i`. All other variables retain their initial states as described.
