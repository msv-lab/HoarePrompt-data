Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each i from 1 to n. The function then returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
