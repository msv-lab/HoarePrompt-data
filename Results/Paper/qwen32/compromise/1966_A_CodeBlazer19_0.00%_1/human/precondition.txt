test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100) representing the number of cards and the number of cards to exchange during each operation, respectively, followed by a list of n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100) representing the numbers written on the cards. The length of test_cases is between 1 and 500, inclusive.
