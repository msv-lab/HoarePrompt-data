You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. It then prints `k - 1` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program always outputs `k - 1` for every test case, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the allowed operations.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to analyze the frequency of each card number in the hand, and then determine how many cards can be removed by repeatedly applying the operation of exchanging `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards.

Here is a step-by-step outline of the correct approach:
1. For each test case, read `n` and `k`.
2. Read the list of card numbers.
3. Count the frequency of each card number.
4. For each unique card number, determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed.
5. Each group of `k` cards can be reduced to `k-1` cards, so for each card number, the number of cards left after all possible operations is `count % k`.
6. The total number of cards left in the hand is the sum of `count % k` for all card numbers.
7. If the total number of cards left is `0`, it means we can reduce all cards, but the problem specifies that we should have at least one card left, so in this case, the result should be `1`.

Given this correct approach, the provided program's output of `k - 1` for every test case is incorrect.
