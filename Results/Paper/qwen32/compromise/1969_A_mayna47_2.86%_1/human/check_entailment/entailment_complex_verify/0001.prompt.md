You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Annotated Code:

for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct.

    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; n is the input integer and n is not equal to 2; p is a list of n integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct; v is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input. If `n` is equal to 2, the specific conditions on `p` and `v` remain as described in the if part. Otherwise, the conditions on `p` and `v` remain as described in the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers for each test case. It then determines and prints either `2` or `3` based on whether there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If `n` is `2`, it always prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints `2` if such an index exists, otherwise it prints `3`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
Monocarp wants to invite at least 2 friends to a party. Each friend \( i \) has a best friend \( p_i \), and the best friend relationship is one-to-one (i.e., \( p_i \neq i \) and all \( p_i \) are distinct). A friend \( i \) will come to the party if both \( i \) and \( p_i \) receive invitations. We need to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of friends \( n \) and the list of best friends \( p \). It then determines the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Base Case for \( n = 2 \)**:
   - If there are only 2 friends, both must be invited for either to attend. Thus, the program correctly prints `2` for this scenario.

2. **Checking for Triangular Relationships**:
   - The program checks if there exists a triplet \( i \), \( v[i] \), and \( v[v[i]] \) such that \( v[v[v[i]]] = i \). If such a triplet is found, it means that inviting two friends in this cycle is sufficient to ensure at least two friends attend the party. This is because:
     - If \( v[v[v[i]]] = i \), then \( i \), \( v[i] \), and \( v[v[i]] \) form a cycle.
     - Inviting any two friends in this cycle (say \( i \) and \( v[i] \)) ensures that both \( i \) and \( v[i] \) come to the party because \( v[i] \) is the best friend of \( i \) and vice versa.
     - Thus, the program correctly prints `2` if such a cycle is found.

3. **Default Case**:
   - If no such triplet is found, the program defaults to printing `3`. This is because in the worst case, Monocarp may need to invite 3 friends to ensure at least 2 attend. This is a conservative estimate and can be true in scenarios where no such triplet exists.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the base case for \( n = 2 \) and efficiently checks for a cycle of three friends that can be invited to ensure at least two attend. If no such cycle is found, it defaults to inviting 3 friends, which is a valid, albeit not necessarily optimal, solution.

Thus, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly handles the base case for \( n = 2 \), checks for a cycle of three friends that can be invited to ensure at least two attend, and defaults to inviting 3 friends if no such cycle is found. This logic aligns with the problem requirements.
Correctness: **True**
