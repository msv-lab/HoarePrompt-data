To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to analyze the behavior of the given loop and the conditions under which it prints `2` and returns.

The loop iterates from `1` to `n` inclusive. For each `i` in this range, it checks if `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`. If this condition is met for any `i`, the loop prints `2` and exits.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000 (though `t` is not used in the loop, it remains unchanged).
- `n` is the input integer and `n` is not equal to 2.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all `p_i` are distinct.
- `v` is a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the input, i.e., `v = [0, 1, 2, ..., n]`.

Let's analyze the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i`:
- `v` is initialized as `[0, 1, 2, ..., n]`. Therefore, for any `i` in the range `[1, n]`, `v[i]` equals `i`.
- Consequently, `v[v[i]]` equals `v[i]` which is `i`.
- Hence, `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `v[v[i]]` which is `i`.

This means that for every `i` in the range `[1, n]`, the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is satisfied. Therefore, the loop will print `2` and return on the first iteration.

Since the loop exits early due to the print statement and return, the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged except for the fact that the function execution stops after the first iteration of the loop.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; n is the input integer and n is not equal to 2; p is a list of n integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct; v is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input.**
