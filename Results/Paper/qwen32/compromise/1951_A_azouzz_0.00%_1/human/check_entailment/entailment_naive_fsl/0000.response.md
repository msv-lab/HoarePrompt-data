Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The problem description describes a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` that should scan subdirectories within the current directory, check if their names are within a specified range, and then generate `-ac.py` and `-wa.py` files for each `.html` file found in those subdirectories. However, the given program defines a function `func_1()` that reads input values and checks for certain conditions related to the count of '1's in a string, which is completely unrelated to the problem description. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block also incorrectly calls `func_1()` instead of `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description.
