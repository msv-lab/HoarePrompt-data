The code snippet increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the value of `trightZero` becomes 1 (since it was 0 before the increment). All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`left` is 0 or `left` is not 0; `right` is 3; `t` is 3; `a` is 3; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `trightZero` is 1; `trightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `rightZero` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; the current character `s[i]` is '0'**.
