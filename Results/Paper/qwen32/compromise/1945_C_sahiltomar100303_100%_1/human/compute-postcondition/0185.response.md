The code snippet `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `rightOne` could be either 0 or 2 depending on whether `s[i]` is '0' or not. After the increment, `rightOne` will be 1 or 3 respectively.

Output State: **`left` is 0 or `left` is not 0; `right` is 3; `t` is 3; `a` is 3; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `mid + 1`; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0' else 1; `rightZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0' else 0; `rightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' else 3.**
