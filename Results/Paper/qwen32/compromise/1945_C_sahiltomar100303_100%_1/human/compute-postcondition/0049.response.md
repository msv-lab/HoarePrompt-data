Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 1`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `i` is `mid + 2`, `rightZero` is 4 if `s[i]` was '0' initially, or 1 if `s[i]` was not '0' initially, `rightOne` is the previous value of `rightOne` plus 1 if `s[i]` was not '0' initially, `trightZero` is 2 if `s[i]` was '0' initially, `trightOne` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` was initially '0', `rightZero` becomes 4 (since it was 3). If `s[i]` was not '0', `rightZero` becomes 1 (since it was 0). The value of `rightOne` is only incremented if `s[i]` was not '0'. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
