Postcondition: **`left` is 0; `right` is 3; `t`, `a`, `n` is 3; `s`, `mid` is 1; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `tleftZero` and `trightZero`, `tleftOne` and `trightOne` depend on the specific values of `s[2]` and `s[3]`. Additionally, the condition `left == 0` is true. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the state remains as described. If `right` is equal to `n`, and `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the condition in the if part holds; otherwise, the condition in the else part holds.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both possible paths through the conditional statement.
