To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

From the initial state, we have the following key information:
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is 3.
- `t`, `a`, `n` are all 3.
- `s`, `mid` are both 1.
- `right` is also explicitly stated to be equal to `n`, which is 3.
- `rightOne` is less than (n + 1) // 2, which evaluates to (3 + 1) // 2 = 2. So, `rightOne` is less than 2.

However, the specific values of `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are not explicitly provided and depend on `s[2]` and `s[3]`. Since `s` is 1, `s[2]` and `s[3]` are out of bounds for the list `s`, but this detail is not crucial for determining the value of `right` to be printed.

The print statement is:
```
print(right)
```

Given that `right` is explicitly set to 3 in the initial state and also explicitly stated to be equal to `n` which is 3, the value of `right` is 3.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **3**
