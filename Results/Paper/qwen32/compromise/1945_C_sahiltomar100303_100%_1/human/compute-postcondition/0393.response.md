The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the value of the variable `left`. According to the initial state, the variable `left` is explicitly given the value of 0.

Let's break down the relevant information:
- `left` is explicitly defined as 0 in the initial state.

Therefore, when the `print(left)` statement is executed, it will output the value of `left`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
