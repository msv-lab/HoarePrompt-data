Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 2`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is less than `n // 2`, `rightZero` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `leftOne` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s` minus 1, `rightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 2) // 2`, `tleftZero` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `trightZero` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `tleftOne` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `trightOne` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, `leftMove` is 0**
