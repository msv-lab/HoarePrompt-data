Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2` (which means `mid` is at least 1), `i` is 1, `leftZero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is either 1 or 2, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 2 if `s[0]` is not '0' otherwise 1, `trightOne` is 0.**

In natural language: The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. If `s[0]` is not '0', `tleftOne` becomes 2; otherwise, it becomes 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
