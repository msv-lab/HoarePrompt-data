Postcondition: **`left` is 0; `right` is 3 and equals `n`; `t`, `a`, `n` is 3; `s`, `mid` is 1; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `tleftZero` and `trightZero`, `tleftOne` and `trightOne` depend on the specific values of `s[2]` and `s[3]`; `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, which is 2.**
