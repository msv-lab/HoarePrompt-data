Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is 2, `leftZero` is 3 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 2, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[0]` is not '0', `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 3 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 2, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 2 if `s[0]` is not '0' otherwise 1, `trightOne` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. Since `tleftZero` was initially 2 if `s[0]` is not '0' and 3 if `s[0]` is '0', after the increment, `tleftZero` becomes 3 if `s[0]` is not '0' and 4 if `s[0]` is '0'. All other variables remain unchanged.
