Based on the provided initial state, the value of the variable `right` is explicitly given as 8. The condition "The current value of `right` is not equal to `n`" does not affect the value of `right` itself, but rather provides additional context about the state of the program.

The `print(right)` statement will output the value of the variable `right`.

Output: **8**
