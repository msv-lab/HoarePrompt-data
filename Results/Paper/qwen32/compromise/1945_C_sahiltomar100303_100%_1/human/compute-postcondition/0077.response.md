Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 2`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is less than `(n // 2 - 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `leftOne` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s` minus 1, `rightOne` is less than `(n - n // 2 + 3) // 2`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `rightOne` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
