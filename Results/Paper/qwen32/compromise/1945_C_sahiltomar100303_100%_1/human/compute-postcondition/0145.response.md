Output State: **`left` is 0 or `left` is not 0; `right` is 3; `t` is 3; `a` is 3; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `trightZero` is 0; `trightOne` depends on the specific value of `s[3]`; `tleftOne` is 0; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `tleftOne` is explicitly set to 0 by the code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not affected by the code.
