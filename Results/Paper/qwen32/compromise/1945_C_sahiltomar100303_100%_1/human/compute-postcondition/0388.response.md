The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(left)
```

From the initial state, we are given that `left` is not 0. However, the exact value of `left` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the value of `left` based on the information given.

Given that `left` is not 0, and no other specific value is mentioned, we cannot determine a numerical value for `left` from the initial state. However, we know it is a non-zero value.

Output: **left (where left is a non-zero value)**
