Output State: **`left` is 0 or `left` is not 0; `right` is 3; `t` is 3; `a` is 3; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `mid + 1`; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; If `s[i]` is '0', then `trightZero` is 3 and `trightOne` is 0; `rightZero` is 3 and `rightOne` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `trightZero` is 2 and `trightOne` is 2; `rightZero` is 1 and `rightOne` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `s[i]` was '0', `rightZero` becomes 3. If `s[i]` was not '0', `rightZero` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
