Output State: **`left` is 0 or `left` is not 0; `right` is 3; `t` is 3; `a` is 3; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `trightZero` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `s[i]` is the current character of the string `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2 and `tleftZero` is 1. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `leftZero` is 2 and `tleftOne` is 1. `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, `leftZero` has been incremented by 1, so if `s[i]` was '0', `leftZero` is now 2 and `tleftZero` remains 1. If `s[i]` was not '0', `leftZero` is now 2 and `tleftOne` remains 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
