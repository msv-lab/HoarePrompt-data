You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a
big road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident
wants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is
described as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident
of the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,
a_j = 1 .

The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be
declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the
right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then
the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the
street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road
also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the
entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.

To make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half
of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
That is, among x residents on one side, at least \lceil\frac{x}{2}\rceil
should want to live on that side, where \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up a
real number x .

To the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j
there must be at least \lceil\frac{i}{2}\rceil zeros. To the right of the
road, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at
least \lceil\frac{n-i}{2}\rceil ones.

Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the
described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
Formally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \left|\frac{n}{2} -
i\right| .

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \left|\frac{n}{2}
- i\right| , output the smaller one.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le
3\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n
, consisting only of 0 and 1 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number i — the position of the house after
which the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,
output 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.

Note

Let's consider the first example of input data.

If we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on
the left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the
right side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be
satisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after
house 1 .

If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left
side (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the
right side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More
than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which
means that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the
optimal answer.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`. The string `a` contains only '0' and '1', representing residents' preferences for living on the left or right side, respectively. For each test case, the function determines and prints the optimal split point in the string such that the number of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side is as balanced as possible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the described problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: 
   - `t`: number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: number of houses.
     - `s`: a string of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1', where '0' means the resident of the corresponding house wants to live on the left side, and '1' means they want to live on the right side.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the position `i` after which the road should be laid to satisfy the conditions.

3. **Conditions**:
   - The road should be laid such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side.
   - If there are multiple valid positions, choose the one closest to the middle of the village.

### Program Analysis:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Splitting the string `s` into two halves (`left` and `right`).
2. Counting the number of '0's and '1's in both halves.
3. Adjusting the split point (`left` and `right`) to find a valid position where the conditions are satisfied.
4. Comparing the positions to find the one closest to the middle.

Let's break down the logic in the program:

1. **Initial Split**:
   - The program initializes `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` to count the number of '0's and '1's in the left and right halves of the string.
   - It then iterates over the first half (`0` to `mid-1`) and the second half (`mid` to `n-1`) to count the '0's and '1's.

2. **Adjusting the Split**:
   - The program tries to move the split point to the left (`leftMove`) until it finds a valid position or reaches the beginning of the string.
   - Similarly, it tries to move the split point to the right (`right`) until it finds a valid position or reaches the end of the string.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - For each position, it checks if the number of '0's in the left part is at least half of the left part's length and if the number of '1's in the right part is at least half of the right part's length.
   - It uses the conditions `(leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)` and `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` to determine if the current split is valid.

4. **Choosing the Closest Valid Position**:
   - After finding valid positions on both sides, the program compares the distances from the middle (`(n + 1) // 2`) and chooses the closest one.
   - If both are equally close, it chooses the smaller position.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Initial Split**:
   - The initial split at `mid` might not be optimal. For example, if `n` is odd, the split will be uneven, and the program might miss a valid position.

2. **Adjusting the Split**:
   - The program only checks positions by moving left and right from `mid`. It might miss a valid position if the optimal position is not in the immediate vicinity of `mid`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the optimal position is at the beginning or the end of the string.

### Correctness:

The program does not guarantee finding the optimal position in all cases due to the limited range of adjustments (only moving left and right from `mid`). It might miss valid positions that are not close to `mid`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
