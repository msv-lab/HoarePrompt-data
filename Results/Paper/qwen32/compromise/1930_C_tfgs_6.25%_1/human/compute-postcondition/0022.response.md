The code snippet appends a new value to the list `ans`. The new value is calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5)
- `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements such that `a[i - 1]` is at least 2 more than `a[i]`
- `counter` is a Counter object with `counter[a[i - 1]]` greater than 0
- `cnt` is `n - len(a)` and must be greater than 0
- `ans` is a list containing the new value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`
- `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a)`
- `j` is `j + 1`

The new value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` is appended to `ans`. This means `ans` now contains one more element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements such that `a[i - 1]` is at least 2 more than `a[i]`; `counter` is a Counter object with `counter[a[i - 1]]` greater than 0; `cnt` is `n - len(a)` and must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list containing the previous values plus `a[i - 1] - j - 1`; `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a)`; `j` is `j + 1`**
