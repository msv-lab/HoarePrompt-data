To understand what will be printed by the statement `print(*ans)`, let's break down the given information and the steps involved in constructing the `ans` list.

### Initial State:
- **`n`**: An integer between 1 and 3 Â· 10^5, representing the desired length of the `ans` list.
- **`a`**: A list of unique integers sorted in descending order.
- **`counter`**: A `Counter` object that keeps track of the counts of elements used in `ans`. The counts are decremented as elements are used.
- **`cnt`**: An integer initialized to 0, likely used to keep track of some count or condition.
- **`ans`**: A list that initially contains all elements of `a`. Additional integers are inserted between consecutive elements of `a` and appended to `ans` such that the length of `ans` is `n`.

### Construction of `ans`:
1. **Initial Elements**: `ans` starts with all elements of the list `a`.
2. **Inserting Additional Elements**: Between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`, additional integers are inserted to meet the length requirement of `n`. The `counter` object helps in managing the counts of these elements.
3. **Appending Elements**: If necessary, additional elements are appended to `ans` to ensure its length is exactly `n`.

### Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the `ans` list, separated by spaces.

### Explanation:
- Since `ans` is constructed to have exactly `n` elements, and `a` is a sorted list of unique integers, the final `ans` list will contain the elements of `a` and additional integers inserted or appended to meet the length requirement.
- The exact values of the additional integers depend on the `counter` object and the logic used to insert them, but they are not specified in detail, so we can only describe the structure of `ans`.

### Final Output:
Based on the construction process described, the `print(*ans)` statement will output the elements of the `ans` list, which includes all elements of `a` and additional integers inserted or appended to meet the length requirement of `n`.

Output: **Elements of `ans` (where `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` and additional integers inserted or appended to meet the length requirement of `n`)**
