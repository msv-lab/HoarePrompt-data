The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the range `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented again by 1, and it must still be less than `adv`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5), `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements such that `a[i - 1]` is at least 2 more than `a[i]`, `counter` is a Counter object with `counter[a[i - 1]]` greater than 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the new value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, and `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a)`, `j` is incremented by 1**.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1`.
