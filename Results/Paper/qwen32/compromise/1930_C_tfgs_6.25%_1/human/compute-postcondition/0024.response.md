Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5), `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object with decremented counts for the elements used in `ans`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - len(ans) - adv`, `ans` is a list containing all the values appended during the loop, and `i` is equal to `len(a)`**

Natural Language: The value of `cnt` is decreased by `adv`. All other variables remain unchanged.
