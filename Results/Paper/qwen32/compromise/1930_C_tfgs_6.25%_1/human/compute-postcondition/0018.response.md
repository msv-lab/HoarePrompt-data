The code snippet `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` appends a new value to the list `ans`. The value being appended is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, where `a[i - 1]` is an element from the list `a`, and `j` is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state but is assumed to be known in the context where this code runs.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `counter`, `cnt`, `i`) remain unchanged except for `ans`, which now includes the newly appended value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5), `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements such that `a[i - 1]` is at least 2 more than `a[i]`, `counter` is a Counter object with `counter[a[i - 1]]` greater than 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the new value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, and `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a)`**.
