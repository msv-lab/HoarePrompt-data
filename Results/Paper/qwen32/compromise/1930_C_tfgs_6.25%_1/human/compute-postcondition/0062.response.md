The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a throwaway variable in this context) and `cnt`. Since `_` does not affect the loop's continuation, we only need to adjust `cnt`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is `n - len(ans) - 2` and must be greater than 0. Since the loop decrements `cnt` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `cnt` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we adjust `cnt` as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object with decremented counts for the elements used in `ans`; `cnt` is `n - len(ans) - 3` and must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` and all additional integers inserted between consecutive elements in `a` up to the constraints of `cnt` and the counts in the `counter`, with an additional element `ans[-2] - 1` appended to it, and then another element `ans[-1] - 1` appended to it.**
