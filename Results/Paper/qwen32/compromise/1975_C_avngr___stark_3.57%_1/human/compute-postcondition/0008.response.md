Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\). If the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i-1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
