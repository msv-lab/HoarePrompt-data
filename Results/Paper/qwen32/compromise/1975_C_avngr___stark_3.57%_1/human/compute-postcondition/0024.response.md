Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\); `_` is incremented by 1; `i` is 1; if the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is greater than the previous `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value.**
