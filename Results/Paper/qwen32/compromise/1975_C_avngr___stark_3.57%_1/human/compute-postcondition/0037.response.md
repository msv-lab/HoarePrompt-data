To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will iterate over the range starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range function requires the stop value (`n`) to be greater than the start value (which is 1).

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The variable `i` is the loop variable that takes on values from the range, and `n` is the upper bound of the range.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `_` is incremented by 1; (Note: This part of the state description is unclear and seems irrelevant to the loop condition, so we will ignore it for this analysis.)
- `n` is an input integer;
- `a` is a list of integers from the input;
- `max` is 0.

Since the loop's execution depends on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to run. The variables `a` and `max` are not directly related to the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
