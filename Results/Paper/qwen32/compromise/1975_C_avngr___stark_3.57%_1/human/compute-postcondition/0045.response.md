The variable `max` is assigned the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the new assignment to `max`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `max` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.**
