### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by sorting the list of integers in non-decreasing order and then pairing them consecutively to maximize the sum of the minimum values in each pair. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness using the function summary and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs (`numInteger`) and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`. This is correct because sorting in non-decreasing order helps in maximizing the sum of the minimum values in each pair.

3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The program uses a while loop to repeatedly pop the first two elements from the sorted list, calculates their minimum, adds this value to the score (`suma`), and continues until the list is empty.
   - This approach ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which is optimal for maximizing the sum of the minimum values.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the computed score for each test case.

Given the function summary, the program's logic matches the optimal strategy described in the problem description. Sorting the list and pairing the smallest elements together indeed maximizes the score.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `1`, `2 3`
   - Sorted List: `[2, 3]`
   - Pairs: `(2, 3)`
   - Minimums: `2`
   - Score: `2`
   - Output: `2`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `2`, `1 1 2 1`
   - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
   - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`
   - Minimums: `1`, `1`
   - Score: `2`
   - Output: `2`

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `3`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`
   - Minimums: `1`, `1`, `1`
   - Score: `3`
   - Output: `3`

All test cases produce the expected outputs, confirming the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the optimal solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
