Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the first element of the original `numbers` list, `numInteger` is an integer read from input, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order with the first two elements removed, `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `i` is 2, `b` is the integer value of the string that was the second element of the original `numbers` list.`**

In simple terms, the value of `suma` is now the minimum of `a` and `b`. All other variables retain their previous values.
