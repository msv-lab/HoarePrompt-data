Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the last element processed (if any), `numInteger` is an integer read from input, `numbers` is [], `suma` is the sum of the minimum values from each pair of numbers originally in the list, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `numInteger`. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
