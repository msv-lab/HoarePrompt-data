The code snippet `q = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `q`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9. These variables are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `q` is an input integer.**
