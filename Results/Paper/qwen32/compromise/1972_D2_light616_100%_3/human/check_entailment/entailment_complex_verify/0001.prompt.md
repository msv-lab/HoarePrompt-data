You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: `x` is `x_final` (smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`), `y` is the last value checked in the inner loop for the previous `x`, `cnt` is `cnt_final` (sum of all valid `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1`).
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the sum of all valid min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) for all pairs (x, y) where gcd(x, y) == 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, calculates the sum of the minimum values of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, and prints this sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `t` is `0` (after decrementing by 1 for each iteration); `func_1()` has been called `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then processes each of these `t` test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one. It does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value, but it implicitly returns the results of processing each test case through `func_1()`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`
This function appears to be designed to solve the problem for a single test case with given \(n\) and \(m\). Here’s how it works:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` (count of valid pairs) to 0.
2. **Outer Loop**: It iterates through possible values of `x` from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
3. **Inner Loop**: For each `x`, it iterates through possible values of `y` starting from 1, checking if \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
4. **Condition Check**: If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the count of valid pairs.

#### Function `func_2`
This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis
The logic in `func_1` is flawed. Here’s why:

1. **Range of `x` and `y`**: The loops iterate over `x` and `y` but do not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges. Specifically, the condition \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\) severely restricts the pairs considered.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` only considers coprime pairs, which is too restrictive. The problem does not require \(a\) and \(b\) to be coprime.
3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The counting mechanism does not correctly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

### Conclusion
Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
