Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze why:

The program attempts to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. However, the logic implemented in `func_1` is flawed and does not cover all possible pairs (a, b).

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Loop Constraints**: The loops in `func_1` are constrained by `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. These constraints are too restrictive and do not allow the program to consider all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges `[1, n]` and `[1, m]`.

2. **Counting Logic**: The counting logic inside the nested loops is incorrect. The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` checks if `x` and `y` are coprime, but this is not sufficient to determine whether `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b` for all possible values of `b`.

3. **Iterating Over All Pairs**: The program should iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`, and check the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` for each pair.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition directly, which ensures correctness. However, note that this solution may not be efficient enough for large inputs due to its O(n * m) complexity. For very large inputs, further optimization would be necessary.
