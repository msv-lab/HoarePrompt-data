To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 3
- `n` is at least 9
- `m` is at least 9
- `y_final` is the largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`
- If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by at least 1

Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting the values: `(2 + 3) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - Since `n` is at least 9, this condition is false because `10` is not less than or equal to `9`.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting the values: `(2 + 3) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - Since `m` is at least 9, this condition is also false because `15` is not less than or equal to `9`.

Since both conditions are false, the loop would not execute another iteration with the current state. To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` and `m` such that both conditions become true.

Let's adjust `n` and `m`:
- For `(x + y) * x <= n` to be true: `10 <= n` (so `n` should be at least 10).
- For `(x + y) * y <= m` to be true: `15 <= m` (so `m` should be at least 15).

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 15**
