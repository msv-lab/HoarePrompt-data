The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since the loop iterates `t` times, and `t` has already been decremented by 1 from its previous value, we need to adjust `t` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1, meaning it now holds the value that represents the remaining number of iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not retain any state between iterations, it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `t` decremented by 1 from its current value (which is already done according to the problem statement).

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `0 <= t <= 10^4` (after decrementing by 1 from the previous value); `func_1()` has been called twice.** 

However, to explicitly show the adjustment for the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `0 <= t <= 10^4` (and `t` has just been decremented by 1 from the previous value, so it represents the remaining number of iterations); `func_1()` has been called twice.** 

Since `t` has already been decremented, no further action is needed on `t` for the state representation. The state remains as described with the understanding that `t` has been properly decremented. 

Final State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `0 <= t <= 10^4` (after decrementing by 1 from the previous value); `func_1()` has been called twice.**
