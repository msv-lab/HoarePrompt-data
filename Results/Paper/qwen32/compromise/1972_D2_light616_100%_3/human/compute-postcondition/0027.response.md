To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `n` is at least 9
- `m` is at least 3
- `y_final` is the largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`.
- The logic involving `cnt` is not relevant to the loop continuation condition.

Let's evaluate the current values of `x` and `y` against `n` and `m`:

1. Calculate `(x + y) * x`:
   \[
   (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
   \]
   Since `n` is at least 9, `8 <= n` is true.

2. Calculate `(x + y) * y`:
   \[
   (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
   \]
   Since `m` is at least 3, `8 <= m` is not necessarily true because `m` could be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, but it must be at least 9 for this condition to hold.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `m` to be at least 9.

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is at least 9, `m` must be at least 9, `y_final` is the largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`.**
