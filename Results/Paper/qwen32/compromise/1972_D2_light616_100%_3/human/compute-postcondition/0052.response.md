To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues to execute and how the variables change with each iteration.

### Initial Setup:
- `x` starts at 3.
- `y` starts at 1.
- `cnt` is initialized based on a specific formula involving `n` and `m`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` hold true.

### Iteration Analysis:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `x` is 3, `y` is 2.
   - Condition check: `(3 + 2) * 3 = 15 <= n` and `(3 + 2) * 2 = 10 <= m`.
   - Since `gcd(3, 2) == 1`, `cnt` is updated by `min(n // 15, m // 10)`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `x` is 3, `y` is 3.
   - Condition check: `(3 + 3) * 3 = 18 <= n` and `(3 + 3) * 3 = 18 <= m`.
   - Since `gcd(3, 3) != 1`, `cnt` remains unchanged.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `x` is 3, `y` is 4.
   - Condition check: `(3 + 4) * 3 = 21 > n` (since `n` must be at least 18 but less than 21 for this iteration to be valid).
   - Since the condition fails, the loop terminates here.

### Conclusion:
The loop terminates after the third iteration because `(3 + 4) * 3 = 21` exceeds `n` (which must be at least 18 but less than 21 for this iteration to be valid). Therefore, the final state of the variables is:

- `x` remains 3.
- `y` is 4 (the value it had when the loop terminated).
- `cnt` is updated based on the first iteration where `gcd(3, 2) == 1`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 4, `cnt` is the initial `cnt` plus `min(n // 15, m // 10)` if `gcd(3, 2) == 1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `x` is still 3, `y` has incremented to 4, and `cnt` has been adjusted by the contribution from the first iteration where `y` was 2.
