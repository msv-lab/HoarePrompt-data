To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head: `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

Given the current state:
- `n` must be at least 3
- `m` must be at least 6
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 3
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1
- `cnt` is increased by `min(n // 3, m // 6)`

Let's evaluate the conditions:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting the values: `(1 + 3) * 1 = 4 <= n`
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 for this condition to hold.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting the values: `(1 + 3) * 3 = 12 <= m`
   - Therefore, `m` must be at least 12 for this condition to hold.

Since `n` must be at least 4 and `m` must be at least 12 for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust these values accordingly.

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `m` must be at least 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is increased by `min(n // 3, m // 6)`**
