Postcondition: **n is 0, k is unchanged, costs is [n - k + 1, 1], h is k, and h is less than k.**

However, there seems to be a logical inconsistency here because if `h` is equal to `k` as stated in the precondition, then the condition `if (h < k)` cannot be true. Therefore, the code would not enter the if statement under the given precondition. If we strictly adhere to the task and assume the if condition is true despite the contradiction, the postcondition would still reflect the if condition being true, which is not possible given the initial precondition. 

To address this, let's assume there might be a typo or an implicit understanding that `h` should be less than `k` for the if condition to be true. Given that, the corrected precondition might imply `h < k` initially. Here is the corrected postcondition based on the if condition being true:

Postcondition: **n is 0, k is unchanged, costs is [n - k + 1, 1], and h is less than k.**
