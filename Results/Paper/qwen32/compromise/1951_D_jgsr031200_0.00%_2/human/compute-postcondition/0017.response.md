Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

- The initial state describes several variables and their values or relationships:
  - `n` is set to 0.
  - `k` is mentioned as "unchanged," which implies it has some value, but its exact value is not specified.
  - `costs` is a list defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Given `n` is 0, this simplifies to `[-k + 1, 1]`.
  - `h` is set to the value of `k`.
  - It is also stated that `h` is not less than `k`, which is consistent with `h` being set to `k`.

- The print statement in the code is:
  ```python
  print(2)
  ```

- The print statement directly outputs the integer `2`. It does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h`. It simply prints the number `2`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **2**
