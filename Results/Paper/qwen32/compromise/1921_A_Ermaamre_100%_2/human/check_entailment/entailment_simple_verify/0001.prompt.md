You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each of the following t test cases consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive (strictly greater than 0) area.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. The program first reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of the square.
3. It then extracts the x-coordinates of the corners and determines the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`).
4. The area of the square is then calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.

The logic is based on the fact that for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, as they should be the same for a square).

However, the program has a flaw. It only considers the x-coordinates to determine the side length of the square. This approach is only correct if the square is aligned such that one of its sides is parallel to the x-axis and the other to the y-axis, and the maximum and minimum x-coordinates indeed represent the side length. This would be true if we were guaranteed that the points were provided in a specific order or if we were guaranteed that the square's sides were aligned with the axes in a way that the x-coordinates span the entire width of the square. 

In the given problem, the square can be oriented in any way as long as its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the provided points are the corners of the square. Thus, the side length of the square can be either `max(x) - min(x)` or `max(y) - min(y)`. The correct approach would be to calculate both `dx` and `dy` (the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates) and then use the larger of the two as the side length of the square.

Here is the corrected logic:
- Calculate `dx` as `max(x) - min(x)`
- Calculate `dy` as `max(y) - min(y)`
- The side length of the square is `max(dx, dy)`
- The area of the square is `side_length * side_length`

Given the provided program, it does not handle all possible orientations correctly, as it only considers the x-coordinates.

Correctness: **False**
