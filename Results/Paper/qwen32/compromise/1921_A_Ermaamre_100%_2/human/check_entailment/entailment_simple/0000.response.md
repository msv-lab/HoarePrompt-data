### Reasoning:
The program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The key steps in the program are:

1. Reading the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, reading the coordinates of the four corners.
3. Extracting the x-coordinates from these corners.
4. Calculating the side length of the square as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.
5. Calculating the area of the square as the square of the side length.
6. Printing the area for each test case.

The program assumes that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, which means that the side length of the square can be determined by the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, as they would yield the same result).

Given the example input and output, we can verify that the program works correctly:
- For the first test case with corners (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2), the x-coordinates are 1, 4, 1, 4. The difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates is 4 - 1 = 3. The area is 3 * 3 = 9.
- For the second test case with corners (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1), the x-coordinates are -1, 1, 1, -1. The difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates is 1 - (-1) = 2. The area is 2 * 2 = 4.
- For the third test case with corners (45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39), the x-coordinates are 45, 45, 17, 17. The difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates is 45 - 17 = 28. The area is 28 * 28 = 784.

The program correctly computes the area for each test case based on the given input.
