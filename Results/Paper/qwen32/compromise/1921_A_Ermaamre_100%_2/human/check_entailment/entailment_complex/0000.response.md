### Reasoning:

The program is designed to compute the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the logic and correctness:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of a corner of the square.

2. **Extracting x-coordinates:**
   - The program extracts the x-coordinates from the four corners and stores them in a list `x`.

3. **Calculating Side Length:**
   - The program calculates the side length of the square by taking the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). This works because the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, so the difference in x-coordinates of the furthest corners gives the side length.

4. **Calculating Area:**
   - The area of the square is then calculated as the square of the side length (`dx * dx`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the area for each test case.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **First Test Case:**
  - Coordinates: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
  - x-coordinates: 1, 4, 1, 4
  - Side length: `max(x) - min(x) = 4 - 1 = 3`
  - Area: `3 * 3 = 9`
  - Output: `9` (Correct)

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Coordinates: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
  - x-coordinates: -1, 1, 1, -1
  - Side length: `max(x) - min(x) = 1 - (-1) = 2`
  - Area: `2 * 2 = 4`
  - Output: `4` (Correct)

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Coordinates: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
  - x-coordinates: 45, 45, 17, 17
  - Side length: `max(x) - min(x) = 45 - 17 = 28`
  - Area: `28 * 28 = 784`
  - Output: `784` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly computes the area of the square for each test case based on the given coordinates. The logic is sound and the implementation matches the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
