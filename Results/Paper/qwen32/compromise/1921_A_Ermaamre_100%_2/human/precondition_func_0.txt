t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each of the following t test cases consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive (strictly greater than 0) area.
