To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code. The loop runs 10 times, and in each iteration, it reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts those parts to integers, and appends them to the lists `x` and `y`.

Since the initial state of `t` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and 100, and the loop does not modify `t`, its value remains unchanged. The lists `x` and `y` start empty and will contain 10 integers each after the loop completes, as each iteration of the loop appends one integer to each list.

Given the loop's behavior, the output state will be:

Output State: **t is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(t) <= 100, and x is a list of 10 integers, and y is a list of 10 integers.**
