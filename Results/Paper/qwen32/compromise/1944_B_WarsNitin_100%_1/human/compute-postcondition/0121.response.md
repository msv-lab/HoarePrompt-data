Postcondition: **`ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `b[n - 1]`. `ans2` is always an empty list. `k` is twice the second integer from the input if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, otherwise `k` is twice the second integer from the input minus 2. `i` is `len(l) - 1`. `q` is incremented by 1. `n` is the first integer from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`. `c` is a sorted list containing elements of `a` from index `n` to the end. `req` is twice the second integer from the input. If `b[0] != b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`; otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**
