Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is equal to the original value of `req`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicates from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes zero or the loop ends; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to the original value of `k`; `l` is a list containing elements from `b` that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element; `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 2. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is -2 if `k` was initially 0, otherwise `k` is `k - 2`, and `c[i]` has been appended to `ans2` twice. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` and `ans2` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` has two more elements which are `c[i-1]` and `c[i]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans2` or `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` includes `c[i]` (and any previous elements), and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged and `k` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
