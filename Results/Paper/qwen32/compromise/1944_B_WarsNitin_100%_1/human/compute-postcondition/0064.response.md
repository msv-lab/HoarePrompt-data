The value of `k` is decremented by 2. Given that `k` was initially either 0 or not equal to 0, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `k` was initially 0, after decrementing by 2, `k` becomes -2.
2. If `k` was initially not equal to 0, after decrementing by 2, `k` becomes `k - 2`.

The values of `n`, `c[i]`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is -2 if `k` was initially 0, otherwise `k` is `k - 2`; `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]; `ans2` has had `c[i]` appended to it twice.**
