The code snippet sorts the list `c`. After sorting, `c` will contain its elements in non-decreasing order. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end.**
