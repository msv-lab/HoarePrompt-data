Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 2. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state description. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without affecting the values of `n` or `i`.
