The code snippet `c = a[n:]` creates a new list `c` that contains all the elements of list `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list. This means that `c` will include all elements of `a` that come after the first `n` elements.

Given the initial state, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`. After executing the code, `c` will contain the remaining elements of `a` that are not included in `b`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end.**
