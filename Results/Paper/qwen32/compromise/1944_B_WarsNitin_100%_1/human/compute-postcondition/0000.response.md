The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. No other variables are modified in this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. Each test case consists of two integers n and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. Additionally, each test case includes a list a of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in a. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^4.**
