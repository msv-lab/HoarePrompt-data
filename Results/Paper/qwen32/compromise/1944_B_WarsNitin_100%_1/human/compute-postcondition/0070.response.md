The given code appends the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, the element being appended is the next element in the list `c`.

Given that `ans2` already has one more element which is `c[i]` (before the current increment), after executing the code, `ans2` will have two more elements: the previous `c[i]` and the new `c[i]` (after increment).

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition related to `k` does not affect the current operation since there is no conditional statement or loop involving `k` in the provided code.

Therefore, the updated state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans2` has two more elements which are `c[i-1]` and `c[i]`.**
