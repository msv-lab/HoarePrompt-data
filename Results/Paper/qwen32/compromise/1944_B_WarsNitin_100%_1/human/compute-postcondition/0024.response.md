Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the elements `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1]]`; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to `k` which is 0. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the elements `b[0]` and possibly `b[n - 1]`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the single element `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, or it remains an empty list if `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`.**
