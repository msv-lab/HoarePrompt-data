The code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `k` by reading from the input. The previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten. The values of `ans1`, `ans2`, `i`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans1` and `ans2` each contain all elements of `l`; `k` is the second integer from the input; `i` is `len(l) - 1`; `q` is incremented by 1; `n` is the first integer from the input.**
