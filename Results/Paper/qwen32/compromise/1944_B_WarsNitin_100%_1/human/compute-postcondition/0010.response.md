The value of `k` is doubled. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, with `k` now being twice its original value; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` (now twice its original value) are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list.**
