Postcondition: **`tc` is `x + 2`, `N` is an integer greater than `x + 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, `i` is `N-1`. If the count of the element at index `i` in `a` is 1, then `t` is 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0.**
