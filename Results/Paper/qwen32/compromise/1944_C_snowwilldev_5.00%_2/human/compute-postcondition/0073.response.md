The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in list `a` within the `cnt` defaultdict.

Given that `i` is `N`, the element at index `N` in list `a` is `a[N]`. The count of `a[N]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1. 

Since `cnt[a[N-1]]` is already incremented by 1 in the initial state, we need to ensure that `cnt[a[N]]` is the only count that changes further due to the current line of code.

Output State: **`tc` is `x + 2`, `N` is the new input integer that must be greater than `x + 3`, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a` with the count of `a[N-1]` incremented by 1 and the count of `a[N]` incremented by 1, `t` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is `N`**.
