Postcondition: **`t` is either 0 or 1, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and the count of each `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from `t` to `N-1`. If `cnt[i]` equals 1, `t` is updated to 2. `i` is `i + 1`.**
