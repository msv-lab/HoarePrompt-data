Postcondition: **`t` is either 0 or 1 (specifically, `t` is 1 if it was initially 0, and `t` is 0 if it was initially 1) if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. `N` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0; `i` is `i + 1`.**
