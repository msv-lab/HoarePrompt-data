Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a`; `ans2` is the same as `ans1`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]`; `ans2` is the same as `ans1` before the increment; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` after the comparison; `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `x` are assigned the values from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `4 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i]`; `ans2` is the same as `ans1` before the increment; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` after the comparison; `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `2 * a[i]` minus `6 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `2 * a[i]` minus `4 * a[i]`; `ans2` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `4 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i]`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `i` is `i`. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is adjusted by subtracting an additional `2 * a[i + x]` and `ans2` by subtracting an additional `4 * a[i + x]`. `ans` has been returned as the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
