The code snippet assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`. Therefore, `ans2` now holds the same value as `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans2` is the same as `ans1`; `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `t` is decremented by 1.**
