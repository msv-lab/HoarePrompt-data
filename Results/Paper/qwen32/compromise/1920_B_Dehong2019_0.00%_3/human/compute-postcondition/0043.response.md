The code snippet `ans2 = ans1` assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`. Therefore, `ans2` now holds the same value as `ans1`.

The values of `a`, `ans1`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a`; `ans2` is the same as `ans1`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input.**
