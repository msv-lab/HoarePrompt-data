Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input split as integers with `k` being greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `i + x` is less than `n`.**
