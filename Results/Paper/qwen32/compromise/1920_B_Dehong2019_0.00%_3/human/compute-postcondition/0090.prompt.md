Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans2` is the same as `ans1`; `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `t` is decremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[i]`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `t` is decremented by 1; `k` must be greater than 0; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the initial `ans1` plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the initial `ans1` plus `a[i]`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `t` is decremented by 1; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the initial `ans1` plus `a[i]` minus `4 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the initial `ans1` plus `a[i]` plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `t` is decremented by 1; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` has been updated to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
