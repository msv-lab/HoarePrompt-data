Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers from the input, with `k` being greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[i]`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is further updated to `ans1 - a[i + x] * 2`.**
