Output State: **`a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the initial `ans1` plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `t` is decremented by 1; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its previous value. All other variables retain their initial states or conditions.
