Postcondition: **`a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the initial `ans1` plus `a[i]` minus `4 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the initial `ans1` plus `a[i]` plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `t` is decremented by 1; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the postcondition is: **`a` remains sorted in descending order. `ans1` is updated by adding `a[i]` and subtracting `4 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`; otherwise, it is updated by adding `a[i]` and `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`. `ans2` remains the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements. `ans` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `x` retain their input values, `t` is decremented by 1, and `k` remains greater than 0. `i` is incremented by 1.**
