The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`.

The state of `nx` and the fact that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted. 

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `j` does not need to be set to a specific value before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
