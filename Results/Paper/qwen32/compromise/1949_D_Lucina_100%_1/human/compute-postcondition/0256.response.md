Postcondition: **`nx` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, 'S' is appended to `nx`; otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.**
