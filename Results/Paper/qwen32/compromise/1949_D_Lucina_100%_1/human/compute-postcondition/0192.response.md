The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nx` is a string.
- `i` and `j` are each incremented by 1 from their previous values.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

The state at the start of the next iteration should have `j` incremented by 1.

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.
