Postcondition: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 1. If `i` or `j` (or both) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, `nx` is either `xx[i][j - 1] + 'F'`, 'FF', or 'SF'. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'FS' or 'SS'.**
