To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is only `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is the new input string.
- `a` and `b` are lists dependent on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the new `x` from positions `k-1` to `n-1`.
- `xx` has the old value of `x` appended to it.
- `i` is 4.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 5.
- `j` is 5.

Since `j` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, we increment `j` by 1 for the next iteration:

State: **`x` is the new input string, `a` and `b` are lists dependent on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the new `x` from positions `k-1` to `n-1`, `xx` has the old value of `x` appended to it, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 6**.
