Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration), and `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Specifically, if `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` has 'S' appended to it; otherwise, `nx` has 'F' appended to it.**
