The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `j-1` of the string `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. 

Given the initial state, `nx` is a string and `i` and `j` have been incremented by 1 from their previous values. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it does not directly affect this operation, but it confirms that `i` is a valid index for the list `xx` if `xx` has at least `n` elements.

Output State: **`nx` is a string with `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**
