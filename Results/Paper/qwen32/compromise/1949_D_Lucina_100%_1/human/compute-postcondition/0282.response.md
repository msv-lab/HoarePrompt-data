Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration). If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` has 'S' appended to it if `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, and 'F' appended to it otherwise.**
