Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is found in the list `sb` up to the index `n // 4 - 1`, 'S' is appended to `nx`; otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.**
