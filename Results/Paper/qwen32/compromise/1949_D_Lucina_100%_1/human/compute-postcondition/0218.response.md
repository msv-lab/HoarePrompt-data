Postcondition: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, plus any additional indices `i` where both `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, the length of `sa` is still less than the length of `sb`, `n` is greater than 0, `nx` is an empty string, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'**
