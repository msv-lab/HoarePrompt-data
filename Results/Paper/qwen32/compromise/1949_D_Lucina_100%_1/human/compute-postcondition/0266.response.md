The code snippet assigns an empty string to the variable `nx`. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, `i` remains incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` remains unchanged, `nx` is an empty string.**
