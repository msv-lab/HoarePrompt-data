Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24; The input consists of `n` lines, where each line contains `n` characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (same scenario). The i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j. At most floor(`n`/2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `xx` is a list containing a single empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = input()
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if x[j - 1] == 'F':
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
            b[i] += 1
            b[j] += 1
    xx.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list where `a[k]` is the count of 'F' in positions `k-1` to `n-1` of `x` including `k=1`, `b` is a list where `b[k]` is the count of 'S' in positions `k-1` to `n-1` of `x` including `k=1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the value of `x`, and `x` is the value of the user's input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list where `a[k]` is the count of 'F' in positions `k-1` to `n-1` of `x`, and `b` is a list where `b[k]` is the count of 'S' in positions `k-1` to `n-1` of `x`. `xx` has `x` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is the new input string, `a` and `b` are lists where `a[4]` is the count of 'F' and `b[4]` is the count of 'S' in `x`, `a[j]` is 1 if `x[j-1]` is 'F' and 0 otherwise, `b[j]` is 1 if `x[j-1]` is 'S' and 0 otherwise, `xx` is the concatenation of `x` repeated `n` times with an additional `x` appended at the end, `i` is 4, and `n` is the length of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
