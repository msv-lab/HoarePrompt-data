The code snippet `a[j] += 1` increases the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given the initial state where `j` is 1, this means `a[1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables `n` and `x[0]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `j` is 1, `x[0]` is 'F', and `a[1]` is increased by 1.**
