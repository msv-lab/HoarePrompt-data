The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is 3, so `a[3]` is increased by 1. The values of `n` and the other elements of `a` (except `a[3]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `j` is 3, and `a[i]` is increased by 1, specifically `a[3]` is increased by 1.**
