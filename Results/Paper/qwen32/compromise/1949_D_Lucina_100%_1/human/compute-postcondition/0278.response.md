The value of `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration), `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`**.
