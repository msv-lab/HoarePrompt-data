The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, and `j` is 3**
