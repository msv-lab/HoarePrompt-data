The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. This means the value of `nx` will now include 'S' at the end of its previous value.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration).
- `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.

After executing `nx += 'S'`, the only variable that changes is `nx`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration), `nx` is the previous value of `nx` with 'S' appended to it.**
