To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided:

- `nx` is a string of length `n`.
- The string `nx` is constructed by appending characters from `xx[i][j - 1]`, 'F', or 'S' based on certain conditions.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.

However, the exact conditions for appending characters from `xx[i][j - 1]`, 'F', or 'S' are not specified, and the specific values of `xx`, `i`, `j`, and `n` are also not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the string `nx` in terms of the process that constructs it.

Given the information:
- `nx` is a string of length `n`.
- The characters in `nx` are determined by the conditions involving `xx[i][j - 1]`, 'F', or 'S'.

Since the exact values and conditions are not provided, we cannot determine the precise characters in the string `nx`. However, we know the length of the string and how it is constructed.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n constructed by appending characters from xx[i][j - 1], 'F', or 'S' based on certain conditions)**
