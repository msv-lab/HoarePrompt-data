Postcondition: **`nx` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` retains its value from the start of the previous iteration. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `xx[i][j - 1]` is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the substring `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, 'S' is appended to `nx`; otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.**
