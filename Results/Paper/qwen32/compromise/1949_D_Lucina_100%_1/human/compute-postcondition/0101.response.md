Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sa` contains the current index `i`, otherwise `sa` remains unchanged. `sb` contains the single element `i` if `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0` and now also contains the new element `i`. `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

The variable `sb` has been updated to include the new element `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
