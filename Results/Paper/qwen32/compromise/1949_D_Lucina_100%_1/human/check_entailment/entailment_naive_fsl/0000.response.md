Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not guarantee that no matter in which order the player approaches the scenarios, they will never see more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. The code seems to be making an arbitrary decision based on the number of scenarios and the initial distribution of funny and scary videos, but it does not ensure the required constraint for all permutations of the scenarios.

The key issue lies in the logic that assigns 'F' and 'S' to the '?' positions. The code does not consider the sequence of videos that could be formed by any permutation of the scenarios. It simply assigns 'F' or 'S' to the '?' positions based on whether the scenario index is in the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) of the list of scenarios with only 'F' or only 'S' videos. This approach does not guarantee that the constraint on the maximum number of consecutive videos of the same type is satisfied for all permutations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
.F??
?.F?
??.?
??.F
```
The code might output something like:
```
.FFF
F.FF
FFF.
FF.F
```
However, if the player follows the order 1, 2, 3, 4, the sequence of videos is 'F', 'F', 'F', which violates the constraint since \(\lceil \frac{3 \cdot 4}{4} \rceil = 3\) and having 3 consecutive 'F' videos is not allowed according to the problem description.

Therefore, the code is incorrect because it does not ensure the required constraint for all possible permutations of the scenarios.
