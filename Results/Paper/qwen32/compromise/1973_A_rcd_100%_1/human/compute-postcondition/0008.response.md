To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(p1 + p2)`, let's analyze the given initial state:

1. `t` is at least 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the context).
2. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
3. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
4. The current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Given these conditions, we need to determine the value of `p1 + p2`.

Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, let's denote the sum as:
\[ \text{sum} = p1 + p2 + p3 \]

Given that `sum` is odd, and knowing that `p3` ≥ `p1 + p2`, we can infer that `p1 + p2` must be an even number (because an odd number minus an even number results in an odd number).

However, without specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `p1 + p2`. We can only state that `p1 + p2` is an even number that, when added to `p3`, results in an odd sum.

Thus, the output will be the value of `p1 + p2`, which is an even number based on the given constraints.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 is an even number such that p1 + p2 ≤ p3 and p1 + p2 + p3 is odd)**
