To determine the output of the `print(p1 + p2)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and constraints:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is at least 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is mentioned for completeness).
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `p3` retains its value. Otherwise, `p3` retains its value anyway (the condition doesn't change `p3`).

2. **Key Points:**
   - The sum \(p1 + p2 + p3\) is odd.
   - Since the sum of three integers is odd, the count of odd numbers among \(p1\), \(p2\), and \(p3\) must be odd (either 1 or 3).

3. **Relevant Calculation:**
   - The `print(p1 + p2)` statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
   - The value of `p1 + p2` can be any integer between 0 and 60 (since \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq 30\)).
   - Given that \(p1 + p2 + p3\) is odd, and \(p3\) is also an integer between 0 and 30, `p1 + p2` must be odd if \(p3\) is even, and `p1 + p2` must be even if \(p3\) is odd.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, but we know that their sum must be such that the total sum \(p1 + p2 + p3\) is odd.
   - Therefore, the output will be the sum of `p1` and `p2`, which is an integer between 0 and 60 and has a parity (odd/even) that ensures the total sum \(p1 + p2 + p3\) is odd.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 is the sum of p1 and p2, ensuring that p1 + p2 + p3 is odd)**
