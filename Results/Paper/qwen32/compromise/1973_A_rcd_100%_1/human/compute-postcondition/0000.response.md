Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and the initial state of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3` remains as each test case contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.**

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to hold the integer value obtained from the input, while the conditions and values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
