To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the initial conditions and the given constraints.

The loop continues as long as `y >= x`. In each iteration, it checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it increments `x` by 1 and decrements `y` by 1.

Given the constraints:
- `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3 < p1 + p2`

Let's analyze the loop's behavior:
1. Initially, `x` is 0 and `y` is `p3`.
2. The loop continues as long as `y >= x`.
3. In each iteration, `x` increases and `y` decreases by 1.
4. The loop breaks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true, and prints `p1 - x + p3`.

Since the loop continues until `y < x` or until the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true, we need to determine the final state of `x` and `y` when the loop terminates.

### Analysis of the Loop Termination:
- The loop will either break when `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true, or it will terminate when `y < x`.
- Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, the loop will eventually reach a point where `y < x` if `p1 - x > p2 - y` for all `x < y`.

Let's consider the final state:
- If the loop breaks due to `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, `x` and `y` will be the values at that point, and the output will be `p1 - x + p3`.
- If the loop terminates due to `y < x`, `x` will be greater than `y`, and the output will be `p3`.

### Final Output State:
Given the constraints and the behavior of the loop, the final output state will be determined by whether the loop breaks due to the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` or due to `y < x`.

If the loop breaks due to `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the output will be `p1 - x + p3`. If the loop terminates due to `y < x`, the output will be `p3`.

Since the loop must terminate at some point, and we are given that the loop executes at least 3 times, we can infer that the loop will eventually reach a point where either the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true or `y < x`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will be the value printed when the loop breaks or terminates. Given the constraints and the behavior of the loop, the final output state is either `p1 - x + p3` or `p3`.

Since the problem specifies the output state after the loop executes all iterations and we know the loop must terminate, the final output state is:

Output State: **p3** (if the loop terminates due to `y < x`), or **p1 - x + p3** (if the loop breaks due to `p1 - x <= p2 - y`).

However, since the problem asks for a single output state after all iterations, and the loop must terminate, the most general and guaranteed final output state is:

Output State: **p3**

This is because if the loop does not break due to `p1 - x <= p2 - y` within the given constraints, it will terminate due to `y < x`, and the output will be `p3`.
