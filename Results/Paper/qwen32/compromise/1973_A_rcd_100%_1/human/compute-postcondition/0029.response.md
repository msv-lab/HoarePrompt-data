The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `y`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `y >= x` still holds, but now `x` is one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and at least 1; `x` and `y` are such that `y >= x + 1`.**
