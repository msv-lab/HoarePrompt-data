Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program does not change the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. Otherwise, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and the program does not change the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`.**
