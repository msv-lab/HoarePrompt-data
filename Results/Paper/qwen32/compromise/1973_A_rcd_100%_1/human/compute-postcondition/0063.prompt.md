Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and they hold the values read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, `p3` retains its original value. `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `p3`.
Code of the loop:
while y >= x:
    if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
        print(p1 - x + p3)
        break
    else:
        x += 1
        y -= 1
else:
    print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\), and they hold the values read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, `p3` retains its original value; if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, then `x` is 0 and `y` is equal to `p3`; otherwise, `x` is 1 and `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is at least 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\), and they hold the values read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, `p3` retains its original value; if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, then `x` is 0 and `y` is equal to `p3`; otherwise, `x` is 1 and `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y` was true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y` was false, `x` is `x + 1` and `y` is `p3 - 2` if `x` was 1 and `y` is `p3 - 1` if `x` was 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is at least 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\), and they hold the values read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, `p3` retains its original value. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, then `x` is 0 and `y` is equal to `p3`. Otherwise, `x` is 1 and `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`. If `p1 - x > p2 - y`, then `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is updated to `p3 - 1` if `x` was 0, or `p3 - 2` if `x` was 1. In all cases, `y` is at least as large as `x`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
