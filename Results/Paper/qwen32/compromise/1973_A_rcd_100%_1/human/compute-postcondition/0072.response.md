The code assigns the value of `p3` to `y`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `p3`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `p3`.**
