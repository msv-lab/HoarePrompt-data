Postcondition: **`t` is at least 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and they hold the values read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, `p3` retains its original value.**

Since the condition `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` is always true based on the precondition (the sum is odd), the else part is never executed. Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the if part.
