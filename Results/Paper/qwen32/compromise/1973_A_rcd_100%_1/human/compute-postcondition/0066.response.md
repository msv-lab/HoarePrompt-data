The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. This overwrites the initial values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` with the new values read from the input. The initial conditions related to the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd, and the relationship between `p3` and the sum of `p1` and `p2` are no longer guaranteed after this operation since the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` have been changed.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.**
