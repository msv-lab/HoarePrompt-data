Let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- `x` is 0 or 1.
- `y` is `x + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Values**:
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, but their specific values are not known from the initial state. They are read from the input.
   - `x` can be either 0 or 1.
   - `y` is defined as `x + 1`, which means if `x` is 0, `y` will be 1, and if `x` is 1, `y` will be 2. However, `y` is not used in the print statement.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   - The expression to be printed is `p1 - x + p3`.
   - Since `x` can only be 0 or 1, the expression simplifies to either `p1 + p3` (if `x` is 0) or `p1 - 1 + p3` (if `x` is 1).

### Output:
The output will depend on the value of `x`, but we can describe it precisely using the given information.

- If `x` is 0, the expression evaluates to `p1 + p3`.
- If `x` is 1, the expression evaluates to `p1 - 1 + p3`.

Thus, the output can be described as:
Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers read from the input, and x is either 0 or 1)**
