The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Given that `x` was initially 0, 1, or 2, after the increment, `x` will be 1, 2, or 3 respectively. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `y` remain unchanged. The precondition that `y` is at least `x` and `y` is 1, 2, or `x + 1` still holds after the increment, but now `y` must be at least the new value of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; `x` is 1, 2, or 3; `y` is 1, 2, or `x + 1` and `y` must be at least `x`.**
