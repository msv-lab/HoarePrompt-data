To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify that it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description for every possible input. The program is supposed to calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players, or return -1 if the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games.

Let's analyze the code:

### Code Analysis
1. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2` is not zero. If it is not zero, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game awards an even number of points: 2 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss).

2. **Max Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2` because the maximum number of draws can be the sum of the lower two scores.
   - Otherwise, it uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws that satisfy the conditions.

### Potential Issues
- **Edge Cases**: We need to ensure that the program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are all zero, or when `p3` is significantly larger than `p1` and `p2`.
- **Inconsistent Scores**: The program should correctly identify when the scores are inconsistent and return `-1`.

### Testing the Code
Let's test the code with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Provided Examples
1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - **Output**: `0`
   - **Explanation**: No games were played, so no draws could have happened.
   - **Result**: Correct

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: One game ended in a draw.
   - **Result**: Correct

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - **Output**: `-1`
   - **Explanation**: Impossible to achieve with valid games.
   - **Result**: Correct

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - **Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: One game with a win and one with a draw.
   - **Result**: Correct

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - **Output**: `-1`
   - **Explanation**: Impossible to achieve with valid games.
   - **Result**: Correct

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - **Output**: `6`
   - **Explanation**: Possible with six draws.
   - **Result**: Correct

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - **Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: Possible with two draws and several wins.
   - **Result**: Correct

#### Additional Edge Cases
1. **Input**: `0 0 1`
   - **Output**: `-1`
   - **Explanation**: Impossible to achieve with valid games.
   - **Result**: Correct

2. **Input**: `0 2 2`
   - **Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: Possible with two draws.
   - **Result**: Correct

3. **Input**: `2 2 4`
   - **Output**: `4`
   - **Explanation**: Possible with four draws.
   - **Result**: Correct

4. **Input**: `1 2 4`
   - **Output**: `-1`
   - **Explanation**: Impossible to achieve with valid games.
   - **Result**: Correct

### Conclusion
After testing the code with the provided examples and additional edge cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all scenarios and edge cases as per the problem description.

**Correctness: True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws or identifies inconsistent scores in all tested cases.
