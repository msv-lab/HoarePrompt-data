Let's break down the problem and the given program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Total Points**: The total points among the three players must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2-0 or 1-1).

2. **Constraints on Scores**:
   - \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \)
   - The sum \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) must be even.
   - The highest score \( p_3 \) should not exceed the sum of the other two scores because the maximum points a player can get is from playing against both other players, and each game awards a maximum of 2 points to the winner.

3. **Maximizing Draws**:
   - Draws contribute 1 point to each player, so to maximize the number of draws, we need to minimize the number of games with a clear winner.
   - The number of draws is maximized when \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are as close to each other as possible and \( p_3 \) is as close to \( p_1 + p_2 \) as possible.

### Program Analysis:

The program follows these steps:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the scores \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \).

2. **Even Total Points Check**: It checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total number of points.

3. **Score Consistency Check**: It checks if \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \). If true, it prints \( p_1 + p_2 \) because in this case, the maximum number of draws occurs when \( p_3 \) wins all games against \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \), and all other games are draws.

4. **Maximizing Draws**: If \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), it uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. The loop tries to balance the points between \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) such that the difference between \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) is minimized while keeping \( p_3 \) consistent.

5. **Output**: The program prints the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

### Evaluation:

The logic in the program seems to cover all the necessary checks and conditions for determining the maximum number of draws or identifying inconsistent scores. The use of the while loop to balance the points between \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) is a reasonable approach to maximize draws.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
