### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred in a series of chess games between three players, given their final scores. The program handles multiple test cases as follows:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.
   
2. **Total Points Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. Since each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1), the sum of the scores must be even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` indicating that the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest score `p3` could be obtained by the player winning all games against the other two players, and all other games could have been draws.
   - Otherwise, the program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It initializes `x` and `y` to `0` and `p3` respectively. The loop iterates, adjusting `x` and `y` to find a valid configuration where the scores can be explained by a combination of wins and draws. The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` ensures that the remaining points after accounting for draws can be distributed as wins between the players in a way that is consistent with the given scores.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

### Correctness:

The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem requirements and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement and examples. The program correctly checks for the consistency of the scores and calculates the maximum number of draws in a systematic way.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
