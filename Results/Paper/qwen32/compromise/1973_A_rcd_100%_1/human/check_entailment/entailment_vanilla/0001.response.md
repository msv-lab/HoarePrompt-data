To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to closely examine its logic in relation to the problem description and the given examples.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Total Points Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is correct because every game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1). Therefore, the total points across all games must be even.

2. **Direct Draw Calculation**:
   - If `(p3 >= p1 + p2)`, it prints `(p1 + p2)`. This is based on the idea that if the highest score (`p3`) is at least the sum of the other two scores, the maximum number of draws would be `(p1 + p2)`. This is because the other two players could have drawn with each other `(p1 + p2)` times, and the third player could have won all games against them.
   - This part seems correct based on the problem constraints.

3. **Iterative Draw Calculation**:
   - If the above condition is not met, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws.
   - It initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively.
   - It then iterates while `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. Inside the loop, it checks if `(p1 - x) <= (p2 - y)`. If this condition is met, it prints `(p1 - x + p3)`.
   - The loop increments `x` and decrements `y` in each iteration.
   - If no valid `x` and `y` are found, it prints `p3`.

### Analysis of Specific Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0` -> No games played, so no draws. Correct output: `0`.
- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1` -> One draw between the second and third players. Correct output: `1`.
- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1` -> Not possible to achieve these scores. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2` -> Two draws possible between the first and second players, and the third player wins one game against one of them. Correct output: `2`.
- **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3` -> Not possible to achieve these scores. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5` -> Six draws possible among the players. Correct output: `6`.
- **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10` -> Not possible to achieve these scores. Correct output: `-1`.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program's logic and comparing it with the expected outputs for the provided test cases, the program appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem.
