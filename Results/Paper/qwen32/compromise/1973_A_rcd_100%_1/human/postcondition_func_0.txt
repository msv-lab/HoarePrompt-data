The function processes up to 500 test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the conditions provided: if the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1; otherwise, it calculates and prints the maximum possible score that can be achieved under the given constraints.
