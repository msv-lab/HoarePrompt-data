The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` modifies the value of `first_row` by appending the first character of the last element in the list `a` to it. 

Given:
- `first_row` is the first character of the initial input provided by the user.
- `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the initial input provided by the user and the second element is the new input provided by the user.

After the code execution:
- `first_row` will be updated to its original value concatenated with the first character of the second element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the initial input provided by the user and the second element is the new input provided by the user, `first_row` is the first character of the initial input provided by the user concatenated with the first character of the second element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the initial input provided by the user, `i` is 1.**
