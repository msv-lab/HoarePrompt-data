Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500. The grid is represented by n lines, each containing m characters, where each character is either 'W' (white) or 'B' (black). The sum of n*m over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
        ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input provided by the user, `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each input in the list `a`, `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each input in the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`. If the first and last elements of `a` each consist of a single repeated character and are not equal, the condition in the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, either the first or last element of `a` does not consist of a single repeated character, or they are equal. Additionally, either the set of characters in `first_row` is not a single character, the set of characters in `last_row` is not a single character, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements which are the input values, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each of the `n` input values concatenated together, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each of the `n` input values concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`. If the first element of `a` consists of identical characters, the last element of `a` consists of identical characters, and the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, then the condition in the if block is met. Otherwise, at least one of the following is true: the first element of `a` does not consist of all identical characters, the last element of `a` does not consist of all identical characters, or the first and last elements of `a` are the same. Additionally, if `first_row` consists of all identical characters and `last_row` consists of all identical characters but `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the condition in the if block is met. Otherwise, either `first_row` and `last_row` are not both composed of the same character, or they are the same string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string containing the first characters of each of the `n` input strings concatenated in order, `last_row` is a string containing the last characters of each of the `n` input strings concatenated in order, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` consists of identical characters, the last string in `a` consists of identical characters, and the first string in `a` is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the set of characters in the first string `a[0]` is not of size 1, or the set of characters in the last string `a[-1]` is not of size 1, or the first string `a[0]` is equal to the last string `a[-1]`. Additionally, if the set of characters in `first_row` is of size 1, the set of characters in `last_row` is of size 1, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the set of characters in `first_row` is not of size 1, or the set of characters in `last_row` is not of size 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
