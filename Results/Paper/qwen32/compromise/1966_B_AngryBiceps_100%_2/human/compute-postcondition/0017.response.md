Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input provided by the user, `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each input in the list `a`, `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each input in the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will contain `n` strings, each provided by the user. The string `first_row` will consist of the first character of each of these `n` strings concatenated together, and the string `last_row` will consist of the last character of each of these `n` strings concatenated together. The variable `i` will be `n-1`, reflecting that the loop has completed `n` iterations. The values of `t` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial values.
