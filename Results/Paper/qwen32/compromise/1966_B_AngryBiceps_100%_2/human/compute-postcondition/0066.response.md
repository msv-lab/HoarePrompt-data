The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to `last_row`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `m` is the second integer from the new input.
- `a` is a list containing `input_value` and the newly appended input.
- `first_row` is the concatenation of its initial value and the first character of the newly appended input.
- `last_row` is the last character of the newly appended input.
- `i` is 1.

After executing the code:
- `last_row` will now be the concatenation of its previous value and the last character of the last element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list containing `input_value` and the newly appended input, `first_row` is the concatenation of its initial value and the first character of the newly appended input, `last_row` is the last character of the newly appended input concatenated with the last character of the last element in the list `a`, `i` is 1.**
