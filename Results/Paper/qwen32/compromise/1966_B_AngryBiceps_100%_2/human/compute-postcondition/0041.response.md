The code appends a third input value to the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements which are the input values, `first_row` is the first character of the first input value concatenated with the first character of the second input value, `last_row` is the last character of the first input value concatenated with the last character of the second input value, `i` is 2.**
