### Reasoning:

The provided Python program addresses the problem by checking two specific conditions for each grid:

1. **First and Last Rows Check**: It checks if the first and last rows are composed entirely of the same character (either all 'W' or all 'B') and if these rows are different from each other. If both conditions are true, it prints "NO".
   
2. **First and Last Columns Check**: It checks if the first and last columns are composed entirely of the same character (either all 'W' or all 'B') and if these columns are different from each other. If both conditions are true, it prints "NO".

If neither of these conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Analysis:

The logic employed by the program is based on the observation that if the first and last rows (or columns) are uniform and different from each other, it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform using the allowed operations. This is because the operation can only change the color of a subrectangle, and if the first and last rows (or columns) are different and uniform, there will always be a boundary between the two colors that cannot be eliminated.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described above. It handles all the given test cases as per the execution summary and the problem statement. The program checks for the specified conditions and provides the correct output based on those conditions.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
