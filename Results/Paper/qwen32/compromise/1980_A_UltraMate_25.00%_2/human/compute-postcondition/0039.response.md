Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` remains unchanged, `s` is the input string, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `t` has been decremented by 1. If `i` is not a key in `hmp`, `ans` is `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
