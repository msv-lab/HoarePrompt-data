The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means that the value of `t` will now be the integer input provided, while the other variables (`n`, `m`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, `a` is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
