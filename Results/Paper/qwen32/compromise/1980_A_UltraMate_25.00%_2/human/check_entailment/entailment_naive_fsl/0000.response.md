Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only considers the difficulty levels 'A' through 'F' and ignores 'G'. This is evident from the line `p = 'ABCDEF'`, which excludes 'G' from the set of difficulty levels that need to be checked.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1
G
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
```

While this specific test case might seem to work, the program will fail for any test case involving the difficulty level 'G'. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1
A
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
```

However, if we include 'G':

**Input:**
```
1
1 1
G
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
```

This is correct, but let's consider a more complex case:

**Input:**
```
1
6 1
ABCDFG
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
```

However, if we consider:

**Input:**
```
1
7 1
ABCDEFG
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs `1` because it does not account for the presence of 'G'. Therefore, the program is incorrect due to its failure to consider the full set of difficulty levels ('A' through 'G').

To fix this issue, the line `p = 'ABCDEF'` should be changed to `p = 'ABCDEFG'`.
