The given code appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Let's break down the changes:

- `ans` initially contains one element, which is \(2^i - 1\).
- The new element being appended to `ans` is `k - sum(ans)`.
- Since `ans` currently has only one element, `sum(ans)` is simply \(2^i - 1\).
- Therefore, the new element being appended is `k - (2^i - 1)`.

After appending, `ans` will have two elements: \(2^i - 1\) and `k - (2^i - 1)`.

The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `temp`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements \(2^i - 1\) and `k - (2^i - 1)`; `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).**
