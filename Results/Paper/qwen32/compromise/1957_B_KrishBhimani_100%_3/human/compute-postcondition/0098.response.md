To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop Iteration Overview**:
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates the highest power of 2 less than `k` and constructs a list `ans` with specific values based on this calculation.

2. **Detailed Processing for Each Test Case**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `arr` is initialized as an empty list.
     - `k0` is set to `k`.
     - `ans` is initialized as an empty list.
     - `temp` starts at 1.
     - `i` starts at 0.
   
   - **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than `k`**:
     - The loop doubles `temp` until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.
     - The variable `i` keeps track of the number of doublings, which corresponds to the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).
   
   - **Constructing the `ans` List**:
     - The first element of `ans` is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is \(2^i - 1\).
     - The second element of `ans` is `k - (2^i - 1)`.
     - The remaining elements of `ans` are filled with zeros until the length of `ans` is `n`.
   
   - **Output**:
     - The list `ans` is printed.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After all `t` iterations, the program will have processed each test case independently.
   - The variables `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`, and `i` will be in their respective states at the end of the last iteration.
   - The variable `t` will be decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.

**Output State: **After all iterations, the program will have processed all `t` test cases, and the final output state will be that `t` is 0, and all other variables (`arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`, `i`) will reflect the state after processing the last test case. Specifically, `arr` will be an empty list, `k0` will be the value of `k` from the last test case, `ans` will contain the computed values for the last test case, `temp` will be the highest power of 2 less than `k` from the last test case, and `i` will be the corresponding exponent.**

In simple terms, the program will have completed all its tasks, and `t` will be 0, indicating no more test cases are left to process. All other variables will hold the values relevant to the last test case processed.
