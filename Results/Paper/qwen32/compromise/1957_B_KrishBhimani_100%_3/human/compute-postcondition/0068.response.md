The code snippet updates the values of `n` and `k` by mapping the integer values from the list `l1`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are already defined based on the first and second elements of `l1`, respectively. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will retain their values as specified by the first and second elements of `l1`.

Other variables (`t`, `l1`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to the old `k`; `ans` is unchanged; `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than the old `k`; `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < \text{old } k\)**.
