The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `arr`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list.**
