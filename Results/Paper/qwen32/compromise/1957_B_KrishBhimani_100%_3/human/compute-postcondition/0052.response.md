The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; if `temp` was initially 2, `temp` is now 4, otherwise `temp` is now 2; `i` is increased by 1.**
