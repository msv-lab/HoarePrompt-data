The given code snippet doubles the value of `temp`. Based on the initial state, `temp` can be either 1, 2, or 4. After executing `temp *= 2`, the new value of `temp` will be 2, 4, or 8 respectively.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- If `temp` was initially 1, it becomes 2.
- If `temp` was initially 2, it becomes 4.
- If `temp` was initially 4, it becomes 8.

The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 2, 4, or 8; `i` is either 0 or 1.**
