The code snippet `temp *= 2` doubles the value of `temp`. Given the initial conditions, `temp` is either 1 or 2. After doubling, `temp` will be either 2 or 4.

- If `temp` was initially 1, it becomes 2.
- If `temp` was initially 2, it becomes 4.

No other variables are affected by this operation. The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 2 or 4; `i` remains 0 or 1 depending on its initial value.**
