Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements \(2^i - 1\) and `k - (2^i - 1)`, followed by `n - 2` zeros if `n` is greater than 1, or `ans` remains unchanged if `n` is 1; `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\). If `n` is 1, `ans` retains its initial form. Otherwise, `ans` has additional zeros to make its length `n`.**
