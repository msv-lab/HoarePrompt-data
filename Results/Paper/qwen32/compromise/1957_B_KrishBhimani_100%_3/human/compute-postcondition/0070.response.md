The code snippet provided is `arr = []`. This line reassigns the variable `arr` to be an empty list. None of the other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`, `i`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to the old `k`; `ans` is unchanged; `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than the old `k`; `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < \text{old } k\)**.
