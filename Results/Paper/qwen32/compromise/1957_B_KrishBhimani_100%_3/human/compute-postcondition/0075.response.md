In this case, the `while` loop is defined as `while True:`, which means it will always execute at least once regardless of the values of any variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary to ensure that the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is 1; `i` is 0.**
