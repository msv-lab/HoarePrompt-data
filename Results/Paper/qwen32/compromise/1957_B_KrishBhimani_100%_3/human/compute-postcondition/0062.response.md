The code appends a new value to the list `ans`. This new value is calculated as `k - sum(ans)`. Initially, `ans` contains one element, which is \(2^i - 1\). Therefore, the sum of `ans` is \(2^i - 1\).

The new value being appended to `ans` is:
\[ k - (2^i - 1) \]

Thus, after the execution of the code, `ans` will contain two elements: \(2^i - 1\) and \(k - (2^i - 1)\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements \(2^i - 1\) and \(k - (2^i - 1)\); `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`; `i` is the exponent of this power of 2.**
