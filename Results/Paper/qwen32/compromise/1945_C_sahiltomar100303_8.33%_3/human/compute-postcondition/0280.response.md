Postcondition: **`t` remains `t`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input string, `mid` remains `n // 2`, `left` is either 0 or not 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` remains `n`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is 1, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0. If `s[i]` is '1', then `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0.**
