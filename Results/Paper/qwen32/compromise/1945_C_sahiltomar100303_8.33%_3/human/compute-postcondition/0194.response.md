Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s such that `leftZero < (mid + 1) // 2` and `rightOne < (n - mid + 1) // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s` minus 1 and `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s` plus 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s` minus 1 and `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s` plus 1.**
