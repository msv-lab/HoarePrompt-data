The code increments the value of `trightOne` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 2 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', `rightOne` is 2 if the current character `s[i]` is '1', `trightOne` is 3 if the current character `s[i]` is '1', `i` is `mid + 1`**
