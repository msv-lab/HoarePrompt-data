Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`. If the current character `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2 and `trightZero` is 2. If the current character `s[i]` is '1', then `rightOne` is 1 and `trightOne` is 1.**
