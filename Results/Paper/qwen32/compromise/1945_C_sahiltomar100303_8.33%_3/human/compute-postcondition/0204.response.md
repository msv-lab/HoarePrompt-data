Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is less than `(mid - 1) // 2` and `leftZero` is decreased by 1, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 3) // 2`**

In simpler terms, the value of `leftZero` is decreased by 1 while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
