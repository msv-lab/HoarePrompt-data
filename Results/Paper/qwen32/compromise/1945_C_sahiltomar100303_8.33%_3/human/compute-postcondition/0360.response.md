Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightZero` is 0 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[0] is '1' otherwise unchanged, `right` is 1, `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 3, `trightOne` is 1 if `s[1]` is '1' otherwise 0, and `tleftOne` is 0 if `s[1] is '0' otherwise 1.**  
The value of `trightZero` is decremented by 1. If `s[0]` is '0', `rightZero` was initially -1, but since the code only modifies `trightZero`, `rightZero` remains -1. If `s[0]` is not '0', `rightZero` was initially 0 and remains 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
