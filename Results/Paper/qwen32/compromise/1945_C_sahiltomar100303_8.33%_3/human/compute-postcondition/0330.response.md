The code snippet increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is 2
- `left` is 1
- `leftZero` and `rightZero` are set based on the character at index 0 of `s`. Since this condition is not specified in the code snippet, we will keep these conditions as they are.
- `leftOne` is decreased by 1 (though the initial value of `leftOne` is not provided, we know it has been decreased by 1 at some point before this snippet).

After running the code snippet, `rightOne` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 1, If the character at index 0 of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is -1 and `rightZero` is 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 0 and `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is decreased by 1; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**
