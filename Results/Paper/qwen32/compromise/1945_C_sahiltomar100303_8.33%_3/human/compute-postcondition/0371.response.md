Let's analyze the given initial state step by step to determine the value of `left` that will be printed.

From the initial state:
- `n` is 2.
- `left` is 0.
- `leftZero` is -1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0.
- `rightZero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0.
- `rightOne` is 1 if `s[0]` is '1' otherwise unchanged.
- `right` is 2.
- `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 1.
- `trightZero` is 0 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 0.
- `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[1]` is '1' otherwise 0.
- `trightOne` is 0 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 0.
- `rightOne` is greater than or equal to 2.

The value of `left` is explicitly given as 0 in the initial state. None of the other variables or conditions affect the value of `left`. Therefore, when the `print(left)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `left`.

Output: **0**
