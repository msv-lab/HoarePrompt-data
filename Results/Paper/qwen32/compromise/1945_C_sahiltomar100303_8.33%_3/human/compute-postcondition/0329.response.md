The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1. However, the initial value of `leftOne` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value after the decrement. All other variables remain unchanged.

Since `leftOne` is not initially defined, the operation `leftOne -= 1` would result in an error in practice. But for the purpose of this exercise, we will assume `leftOne` exists and proceed with the decrement.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 1, If the character at index 0 of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is -1 and `rightZero` is 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 0 and `rightOne` is 0; `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**
