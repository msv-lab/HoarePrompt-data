The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The values of `mid` and `n` maintain their initial relationship where `mid` must be less than `n`. The value of `i` is already defined as `i + 1` in the initial state, and this relationship is not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `i + 1`, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`**.
