The code increments `trightZero` by 1. Therefore, `trightZero` changes from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s` plus 1, `trightZero` is 4, `rightOne` is 1, `trightOne` is 1, `i` is `mid + 2`**.
