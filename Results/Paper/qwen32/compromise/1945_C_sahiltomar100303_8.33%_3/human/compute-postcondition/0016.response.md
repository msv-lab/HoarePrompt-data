Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2` (which is at least 1), `i` is 0, `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, and `s[i]` is '0'.**

Natural Language: The value of `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
