The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The values of `mid`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The precondition that `mid` must be less than `n` and `i` is `i + 1` still holds true.

Output State: **`mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `i + 1`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1.**
