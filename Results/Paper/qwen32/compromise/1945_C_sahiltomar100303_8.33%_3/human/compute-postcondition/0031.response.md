Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 4, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 3, `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is '1', then `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 3, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 3, `trightOne` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `tleftOne` has been incremented by 1, so if `s[i]` was '0', `tleftOne` is now 3, and if `s[i]` was '1', `tleftOne` is also now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
