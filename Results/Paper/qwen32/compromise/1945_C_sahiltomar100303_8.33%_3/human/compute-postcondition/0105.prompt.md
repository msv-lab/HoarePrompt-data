Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `tleftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid`.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2` + 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2` - 1, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`. If `s[right]` is '0', `trightZero` is one less than its previous value. If `s[right]` is '1', `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 2) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid + 3`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `trightZero` is `trightZero - 1`. Otherwise, `trightOne` is `trightOne - 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
