Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[0]` is '1' otherwise unchanged, `right` is 1, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `s[right]` is not '0', `tleftOne` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `trightOne` is decremented by 1. Initially, `trightOne` is 0, so after the decrement, `trightOne` remains 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
