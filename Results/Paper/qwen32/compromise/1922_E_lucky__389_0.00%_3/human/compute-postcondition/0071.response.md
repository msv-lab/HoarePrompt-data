Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the input, processes it to determine a sequence of significant bit positions, and prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself. The input `X` must be an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. The function does not accept a parameter `t` for the number of test cases; instead, it processes a single input value `X`.**
