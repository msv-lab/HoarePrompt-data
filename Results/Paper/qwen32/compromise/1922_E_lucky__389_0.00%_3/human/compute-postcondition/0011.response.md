The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was initially 2, `i` is now 3. The other variables `t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` must be at least 7, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 3**.
