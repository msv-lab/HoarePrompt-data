The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `subseq_lens`. The variables `t`, `X`, and `x` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the initial conditions for `t`, `X`, and `x` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is the input value minus 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**
