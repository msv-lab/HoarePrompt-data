You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find an array of integers of length at most 200, such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences.
- If it's impossible to find such an array, we need to print -1.
- If there are multiple possible arrays, any of them is acceptable.
- All elements of the array should be in the range [-10^9, 10^9].

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by decomposing the value of X-1 into a sum of powers of 2, which corresponds to the lengths of increasing subsequences in the array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X` and subtracts 1 from it. This is because the empty subsequence is always counted, so we need `X-1` additional increasing subsequences.

2. **Decomposing X-1**:
   - The code decomposes `X-1` into a sum of distinct powers of 2. This is done by finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X` and subtracting it from `X`, repeating until `X` becomes 0.
   - The exponents of these powers of 2 are stored in the list `subseq_lens`.

3. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The code constructs the array `ansv` based on the exponents found in the previous step.
   - It initializes `ansv` with a sequence of integers from 0 to `mx-1`, where `mx` is the maximum exponent found.
   - It then appends the exponents from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.

4. **Output**:
   - The code prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Correctness of Decomposition**:
  - The decomposition of `X-1` into a sum of distinct powers of 2 is correct. This is a standard way to represent a number in binary.
  
- **Correctness of Array Construction**:
  - The constructed array is supposed to have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the way the array is constructed from `subseq_lens` is not guaranteed to produce the correct number of increasing subsequences.
  - The construction logic seems flawed because it does not ensure that the subsequences are strictly increasing in a way that matches the required number of subsequences.

### Edge Cases:
- **X = 2**:
  - The code should output an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences. For example, `[0]` has 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
  - The code outputs `[0]`, which is correct for this case.

- **X = 5**:
  - The code should output an array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences. For example, `[0, 1, 0]` has 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 1, 0]`.
  - The code outputs `[0, 1, 0]`, which is correct for this case.

- **X = 13**:
  - The code should output an array with exactly 13 increasing subsequences. For example, `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has 13 increasing subsequences.
  - The code outputs `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, which is correct for this case.

- **X = 37**:
  - The code should output an array with exactly 37 increasing subsequences. The provided example output `[ -1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` is correct for this case.
  - The code outputs `[ -1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]`, which is correct for this case.

### Conclusion:
While the code seems to work for the provided examples, the logic for constructing the array from `subseq_lens` is not well-explained or guaranteed to produce the correct number of increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X`. The code does not handle the construction of the array in a way that ensures the exact number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X`. The logic for constructing the array from `subseq_lens` is not robust and may fail for certain inputs.
