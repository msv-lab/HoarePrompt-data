Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. However, there are several issues in the logic and implementation of the program that make it incorrect:

1. The function `func_1()` is supposed to handle each test case, but it doesn't do so correctly. It reads a single integer `X` and processes it, but it doesn't handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

2. The algorithm to determine the array is flawed. The code tries to find significant bit positions by repeatedly subtracting powers of 2 from `X - 1`, but it doesn't correctly map these positions to an array that would have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

3. The final array `ansv` is constructed incorrectly. It starts with a sequence from 0 to `mx - 1` and then appends elements from `subseq_lens` starting from the second element. This doesn't guarantee that the resulting array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. The program doesn't handle the case where it's impossible to find such an array. It should output `-1` in such cases.

5. The output format is incorrect. The program prints the length of the array and then the array elements, but it doesn't ensure that the array has the correct number of increasing subsequences.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
