Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state:

1. **Understanding `temp`:**
   - `temp` is either -1 or the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met.
   - If `temp` is not -1, it indicates the first index where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the corresponding element from the end of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the corresponding element from the start of `b`.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - If `temp` is not -1, `ans` contains:
     - `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `temp - 1`
     - `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n - 1`
   - If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains:
     - `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `n - 1`
   
3. **Sum of `ans`:**
   - The `print(sum(ans))` statement will print the sum of all elements in the `ans` list.

### Explanation of the Output:

- **Case 1: `temp` is -1**
  - This means the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is never met for any `i`.
  - Therefore, `ans` will contain `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for all `j` from `0` to `n - 1`.
  - The sum of `ans` will be the sum of `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for all `j` from `0` to `n - 1`.

- **Case 2: `temp` is not -1**
  - This means there is at least one index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`.
  - `ans` will contain:
    - `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `temp - 1`
    - `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n - 1`
  - The sum of `ans` will be the sum of these absolute differences.

### Final Output:

Given the above explanation, the output of the `print(sum(ans))` statement will be:

Output: **sum of `ans` (where `ans` is defined as `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `temp - 1` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n - 1` if `temp` is not -1, otherwise `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `n - 1`)**
