The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` to `temp`. The value of `i` is `i + 1` based on the initial state, so `temp` will now hold the value `i + 1`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` is `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
