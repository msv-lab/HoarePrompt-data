The code snippet appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `temp` are not affected by this operation unless `temp` was previously set in a prior condition that is not part of the given snippet. Since the snippet does not modify `n`, `a`, `b`, or `temp`, these variables retain their initial states. The only change is the addition of a new element to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` now includes `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` retains its previous value**.
