To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the given initial conditions. The loop runs from `i = temp` to `i = n - 1`, appending `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to `ans` for each iteration.

**Given:**
- `temp` is the index where `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)]) > abs(a[temp] - b[temp])` is met, and `temp` is not equal to -1.
- `ans` contains `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `i - 1` initially.
- The loop runs from `i = temp` to `i = n - 1`.

**Loop Execution:**
- For each iteration from `i = temp` to `i = n - 1`, the loop appends `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to `ans`.

**Final Output State:**
- After the loop finishes, `ans` will contain `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `temp - 1` (initially) plus `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n - 1`.

In simpler terms, `ans` will contain the absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` for all indices from `0` to `n - 1`, but with the condition that for `i >= temp`, the element from `b` used is `b[-(n - i)]` instead of `b[i]`.

**Output State: **`ans` contains `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `temp - 1` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n - 1`.**

This means that `ans` will have `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n - 1` appended to it, completing the transformation as specified by the loop.
