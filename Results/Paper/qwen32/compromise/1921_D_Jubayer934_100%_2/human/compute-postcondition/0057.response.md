To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `temp` is less than `n`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met.
- `ans` contains `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `i - 1`.
- `temp` is not equal to -1.

The loop head `for i in range(temp, n):` will execute if `temp` is less than `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `temp` is a valid index and `n` is greater than `temp`.

State: **`temp` is an index where `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)]) > abs(a[temp] - b[temp])` is met, and `temp` is not equal to -1, `n` must be greater than `temp`**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing from `i = temp` up to `n - 1`.
