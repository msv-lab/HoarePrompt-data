Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **`temp`**: This variable holds the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true. If this condition never becomes true, `temp` is `-1`.

2. **`ans`**: This list is constructed based on the value of `temp`:
   - If `temp` is not `-1`, `ans` includes:
     - The absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `temp` (inclusive).
     - The absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - If `temp` is `-1`, `ans` includes:
     - The absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive).

### Code Snippet Analysis:

The code snippet is:
```
print(sum(ans))
```

### Determining the Output:

- **If `temp` is `-1`**:
  - `ans` includes the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
  - Therefore, `sum(ans)` is the sum of all `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.

- **If `temp` is not `-1`**:
  - `ans` includes:
    - The absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `temp`.
    - The absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.
  - Therefore, `sum(ans)` is the sum of these absolute differences.

### Final Output Description:

The `print(sum(ans))` statement will output the sum of the absolute differences as described above. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sum(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum.

Output: **sum(ans) (where ans is the list of absolute differences as described in the initial state based on the value of temp)**
