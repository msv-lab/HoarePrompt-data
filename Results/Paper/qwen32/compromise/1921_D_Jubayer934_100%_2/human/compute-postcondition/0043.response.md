Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are lists of integers. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no changes are made to `temp`.**
