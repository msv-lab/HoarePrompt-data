The code snippet `temp = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `temp`, overwriting its previous value. The initial state specifies that `temp` was either `i` (if a certain condition was met) or `-1` (if it was not). After the assignment, `temp` is guaranteed to be `i`.

The other variables (`ans`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment, so their states remain the same.

Output State: **`temp` is `i`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is assigned the value read from the input; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input list; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input list in descending order; `i` is incremented by 1.**
