The code snippet `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or the condition related to `temp`. The only change is that `ans` now includes an additional element, which is `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` includes the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])` and `abs(a[i] - b[i])`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` is greater than `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to `temp` or the loop continues.**
