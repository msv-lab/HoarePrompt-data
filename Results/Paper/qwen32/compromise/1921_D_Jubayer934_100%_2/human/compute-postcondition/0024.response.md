To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables within the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `temp`. The loop will execute if `temp` is less than `n`, as the loop iterates from `temp` to `n-1`.

Given the state:
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer from the input.
- `temp` is the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met, and `temp` is not equal to -1.
- `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at the index `temp`.
- `a` remains the sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.
- `b` remains the first `m` elements of the sorted list of the next `m` integers from the input in reverse order.

The loop:
```python
for i in range(temp, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `temp` must be less than `n`. Since it is given that `temp` is not equal to -1, we need to ensure that `temp` is a valid index within the range `[0, n-1]`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `temp` is a valid starting index for the loop. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is initialized by the loop itself.

State: **`n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer such that `0 <= temp < n`, `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at the index `temp`, `a` remains the sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` remains the first `m` elements of the sorted list of the next `m` integers from the input in reverse order**
