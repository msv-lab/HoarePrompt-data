Postcondition: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i] - b[i])`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is set to `i + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `temp` retains its previous value. `i` is `i + 1`.**
