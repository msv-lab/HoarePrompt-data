The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the variables `n` and `k` as the values returned by the function `func_4()`, and it specifies that the current value of `n` is 0. However, the `print` statement does not use these variables `n` and `k` at all. It directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement is independent of the values of `n` and `k`, the output will simply be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
