The code snippet `n, k = func_4()` assigns the values returned by the function `func_4()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the function `func_4()` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that it returns two values, which will be assigned to `n` and `k`.

Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 10^12). After the execution of `n, k = func_4()`, the values of `n` and `k` will be whatever `func_4()` returns. The other conditions on the ranges of `n` and `k` are no longer guaranteed unless `func_4()` specifically returns values within those ranges.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`.**
