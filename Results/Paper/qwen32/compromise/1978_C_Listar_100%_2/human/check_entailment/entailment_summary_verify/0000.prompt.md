You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        k = k - i + 1
        l = func_3(c, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(c, k, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[-c - k])
    (l[-c], l[-c - k]) = (y, x)
    return l

#Function 3:
def func_3(c, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[c - 1])
    (l[c - 1], l[-c]) = (x, y)
    return l

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2:
        return (0, 0)
    if n % 2:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    if max_k < k:
        return (0, 0)
    return (n, k)

#Function 5:
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    return

#Function 6:
def func_6():
    (n, k) = func_4()
    if n == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 6 : The function `func_6` retrieves values `n` and `k` from `func_4()`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it processes these values using `func_1(n, k)` and then calls `func_5()` with the result, ultimately returning `None`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly in the way it calculates and constructs permutations to achieve the desired Manhattan value `k`.

### Issues:
1. **Handling of Odd `k` Values**: The program immediately returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd, which is incorrect. The Manhattan value can indeed be odd for certain permutations. For example, a permutation of length 2 can have a Manhattan value of 1, as shown in the example with `n=2` and `k=1` (permutation `[2, 1]`).

2. **Maximum `k` Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` as `(n^2 - 1) // 2` for odd `n` and `n^2 // 2` for even `n`. However, this calculation is incorrect. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is actually `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is because the maximum deviation for each element `p_i` from its position `i` is `n - 1`, and there are `n` elements, but the sum of deviations is maximized when each element is placed at the opposite end, leading to a sum of `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

3. **Permutation Construction**: The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` for constructing the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value `k` is not robust and may not cover all cases. The approach seems to be based on swapping elements to increase the Manhattan value, but it does not guarantee that it can achieve every possible `k` value.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the case `n=2` and `k=1`. The correct output should be:
```
YES
2 1
```
However, the program will return `NO` because it incorrectly handles odd `k` values.

### Conclusion:
Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
