You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a` as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why the program is incorrect by considering a specific test case.

### Problem Understanding:
The array `a` is constructed such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The task is to reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a`.

### Example Test Case:
Let's consider the following test case from the problem description:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

### Explanation of the Expected Output:
- `a_1 = MEX(p_1) - p_1`
  - `MEX([0]) = 1`
  - `a_1 = 1 - 0 = 1`
- `a_2 = MEX(p_1, p_2) - p_2`
  - `MEX([0, 1]) = 2`
  - `a_2 = 2 - 1 = 1`
- `a_3 = MEX(p_1, p_2, p_3) - p_3`
  - `MEX([0, 1, 4]) = 2`
  - `a_3 = 2 - 4 = -2`
- `a_4 = MEX(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) - p_4`
  - `MEX([0, 1, 4, 2]) = 3`
  - `a_4 = 3 - 2 = 1`
- `a_5 = MEX(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5) - p_5`
  - `MEX([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) = 5`
  - `a_5 = 5 - 3 = 2`

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation `p` by maintaining a `mex` list and adjusting the `minn` and `maxx` variables. However, it does not correctly compute the `p_i` values based on the `a_i` values.

### Issue in the Program:
- The program incorrectly computes the `mex` values and the permutation `p` values. Specifically, the logic for handling negative `a_i` values is incorrect.
- The program does not properly track the MEX value of the current prefix of `p` and adjust `p_i` accordingly.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the same test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Program Output:**
The provided program might output something like `0 1 2 3 4` or another incorrect permutation, which does not satisfy the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` for all possible inputs, including the given test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.

Correctness: **False**
