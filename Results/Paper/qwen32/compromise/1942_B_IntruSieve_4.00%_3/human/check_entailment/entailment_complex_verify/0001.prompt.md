You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and prints a list of `n` integers that represents a specific permutation `p` derived from the input list `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
We need to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from an array \( a \) where each element \( a_i \) is defined as:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array \( a \) and constructing the permutation \( p \) based on the given formula.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, representing the current minimum non-negative integer not yet used in \( p \).
   - `maxx` is initialized to 0, representing the maximum value encountered in the `mex` list so far.

2. **Iteration through \( a \):**
   - For each element \( a_i \) in the array \( a \):
     - If \( a_i \) is positive:
       - The program appends `minn` to `mex`.
       - Increments `minn` by 1.
       - If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` by 1 again.
     - If \( a_i \) is non-positive:
       - The program appends \( |\text{arr}[i] - \text{minn}| \) to `mex`.
       - If \( |\text{arr}[i] - \text{minn}| \) is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `mex` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of Non-Positive \( a_i \):** The program incorrectly calculates the value to append to `mex` when \( a_i \) is non-positive. It should be solving for \( p_i \) such that:
  \[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]
  This implies:
  \[ p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \]
  The current implementation does not correctly handle this relationship.
  
- **Updating `maxx`:** The variable `maxx` is not being used correctly. It should track the maximum value in `mex`, but the current logic does not ensure this.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic to reconstruct the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \). The handling of non-positive values in \( a \) and the logic to maintain the MEX value are incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
