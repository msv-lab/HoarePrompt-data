In the given for loop, the only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to ensure the loop can execute.

The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because `range(n)` will generate at least one value (0) if `n` is 1 or greater. The variable `i` is the loop variable that will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `arr`, `mex`, `minn`, `maxx`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

So, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 1. The value of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0**
