To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to carefully analyze how the variables `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` are updated within the loop.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` starts as an empty list.
   - `minn` starts at 0.
   - `maxx` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the list `arr`:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0:
       - Append `minn` to the `mex` list.
       - Increment `minn` by 1.
       - If `minn` equals `maxx`, increment `minn` by 1 again.
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0:
       - Compute `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and append it to the `mex` list.
       - If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, update `maxx` to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

3. **Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `mex` will contain `n` elements, each derived from the rules above.
   - `minn` will be the value it takes after all increments, which depends on the number of positive numbers and the specific values in `arr`.
   - `maxx` will be the maximum value encountered during the computation of `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

The exact values of `minn` and `maxx` depend on the specific input values in `arr`. However, we can describe the output state in a general form:

- `mex` will be a list of `n` integers.
- `minn` will be the final value after all increments.
- `maxx` will be the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` encountered during the loop.

Given the format requirement, the output state would be described as:

Output State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is the final value after all increments, and `maxx` is the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` encountered during the loop.**
