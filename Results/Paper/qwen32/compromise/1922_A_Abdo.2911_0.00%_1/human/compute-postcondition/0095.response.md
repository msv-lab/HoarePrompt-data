Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the first character of `a`; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in `b`.**

In simpler terms, the character at index `i` (which is 0) of string `a` has been added to the `template` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
