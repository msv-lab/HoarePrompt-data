Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is an index such that `0 ≤ i < n`; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `template[i]` is not a lowercase character; if `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is `False`; otherwise, the behavior is undefined as there is no else part.**
