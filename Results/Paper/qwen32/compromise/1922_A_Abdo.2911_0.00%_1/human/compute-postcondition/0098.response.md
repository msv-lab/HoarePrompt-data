Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing either the first character of `a` or the uppercase version of the first character of `a` depending on whether the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in `b`, `template` contains the first character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of the first character of `a`.**
