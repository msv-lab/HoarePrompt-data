The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same as long as it is greater than `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing either the first character of `a` or the uppercase version of the first character of `a` depending on whether the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 1**.
