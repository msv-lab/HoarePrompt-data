The `break` statement will terminate the most inner loop or if statement it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `template`, `match_a_b`, or `match_c`. The variable `match_a_b` will be `False` because the loop will not complete all iterations without breaking due to the `break` statement. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is an index such that `0 ≤ i < n`; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `False`; `template[i]` is not a lowercase character; `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`**
