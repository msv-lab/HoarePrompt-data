The `break` statement in the given code does not alter the values of any variables. It only exits the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`, `match_a_b`, `match_c`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
