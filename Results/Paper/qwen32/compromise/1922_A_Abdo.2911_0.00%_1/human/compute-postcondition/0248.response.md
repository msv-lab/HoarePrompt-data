Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is incremented by 1; `template` and `match_a_b` remain as per their definitions and values from the previous iteration. If `c[i] != template[i]`, then `match_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_c` retains its previous value.**
