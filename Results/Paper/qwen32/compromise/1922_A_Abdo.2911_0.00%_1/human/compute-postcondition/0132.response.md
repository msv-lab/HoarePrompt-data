Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is `False` and the execution breaks out of the internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged. `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 2.**
