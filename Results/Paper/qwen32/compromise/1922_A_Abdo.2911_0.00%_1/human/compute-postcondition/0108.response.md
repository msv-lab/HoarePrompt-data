The code snippet sets `match_a_b` to `True`. This change does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`, `match_c`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is `n`.**
