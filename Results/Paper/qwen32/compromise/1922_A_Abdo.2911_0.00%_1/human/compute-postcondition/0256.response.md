Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is `n-1`; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True` (or both)**

Since the program does not enter the if block, the condition `(match_a_b and (not match_c))` is false. This means that either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True` (or both), while the rest of the precondition remains unchanged.
