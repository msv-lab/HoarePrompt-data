Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is the integer value of user input; `a` is the string value of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the new string value of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the new string value of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is an empty list; `i` is the integer value of user input; If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then `match_a_b` remains `True` and `match_c` remains `False`. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True` (or both).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 0; `template` is a list containing either the character `a[0]` or the uppercase version of the first character of `a`; `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` if `template` contains `a[0]`, otherwise `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then `match_a_b` remains `True` and `match_c` remains `False`. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True` (or both).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 1; `template` is a list containing either the character `a[0]` or the uppercase version of the first character of `a`, and now also contains either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `template` contains `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `template` contains the uppercase version of `a[i]`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then `match_a_b` remains `True` and `match_c` remains `False`. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True` (or both).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 2; `template` is a list containing the first character of `a` (or its uppercase version), the second character of `a` (or its uppercase version if it is not equal to the second character of `b`), and the third character of `a` (or its uppercase version if `a[2]` is not equal to `b[2]`); if `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`, then `template` contains `a[1]` as its second element; if `a[1]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `template` contains the uppercase version of `a[1]` as its second element; if `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then `match_a_b` remains `True` and `match_c` remains `False`. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True` (or both).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
