#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains three elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a list a of length n (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and a list b of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). The first element of arr is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the list `arr` sorted in reverse order. Each sublist (test case) in `arr` is considered as a single element during the sorting process, and the sorting is done based on the default lexicographical order of the sublists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each sublist represents a test case with three elements: an integer `n`, a list `a` of length `n`, and a list `b` of length `n`. It returns the list `arr` sorted in reverse lexicographical order, treating each sublist as a single element.
