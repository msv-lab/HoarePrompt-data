You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases` as input. It returns a list `results` where each element is the `best_y` value for the corresponding `x` in `test_cases`. The `best_y` is determined by finding the integer `y` (1 <= y < x) that maximizes the sum of `y` and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program aims to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) for each test case such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) plus \( y \) is maximized. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then reads \( t \) integers \( x \) for each test case.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each \( x \), the program initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1. The goal is to find a \( y \) that maximizes the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
3. **Iterate Over Possible \( y \) Values**: The program iterates over possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 1.
4. **Compute GCD and Sum**: For each \( y \), it computes the GCD of \( x \) and \( y \) and then calculates the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
5. **Update Best \( y \)**: If the calculated sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current \( y \). The `break` statement ensures that the loop exits after the first update, which is incorrect because it only considers the first \( y \) that increases the sum, not the maximum possible sum.
6. **Store Result**: After the loop, the program appends the `best_y` found to the `results` list.
7. **Output Results**: Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

**Issue in the Program**:
The critical issue here is the `break` statement inside the loop. This statement causes the loop to exit after the first \( y \) that increases the sum, which does not guarantee that the maximum possible sum is found. The loop should continue to check all possible values of \( y \) to ensure the maximum sum is found.

**Correctness**:
Given the issue with the `break` statement, the program does not always find the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
