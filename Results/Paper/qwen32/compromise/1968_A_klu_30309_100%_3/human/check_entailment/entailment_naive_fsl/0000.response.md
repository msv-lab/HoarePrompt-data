Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided code has a logic error in the inner loop where it breaks prematurely after finding the first `y` that maximizes the sum. This means the code does not necessarily find the optimal `y` for each test case.

Here's a specific example where the code fails:

For `x = 10`, the code will start checking from `y = 9` down to `1`. It will find that `gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 10`, which is the maximum possible sum for `x = 10`. However, it breaks after checking `y = 9` and does not check if there's a better `y` (which there isn't in this case, but the code logic is incorrect).

However, let's consider another example to demonstrate the issue more clearly:

For `x = 15`, the code will start checking from `y = 14` down to `1`. It will find that `gcd(15, 14) + 14 = 15`, and it will break immediately. But the optimal `y` is actually `10` because `gcd(15, 10) + 10 = 25`, which is the maximum possible sum for `x = 15`.

To fix this, the `break` statement should be removed so that the code checks all possible values of `y` before determining the best one. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
        results.append(best_y)
    return results
```

In this corrected version, the `break` statement is removed, allowing the code to find the optimal `y` for each test case.
