Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000); `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `x` is the second element in `test_cases`; `y` is `y + 1`; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` and `best_y` is updated to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
