The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or control structure it is within. Therefore, the values of `x`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`, `best_y`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; `max_sum` is `current_sum`; `best_y` is `y`; `y` is decremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of all the variables stay the same, and the loop or control structure is exited.
