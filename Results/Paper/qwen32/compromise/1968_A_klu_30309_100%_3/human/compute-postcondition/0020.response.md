Output State: **`x` is at least 2; `y` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.**

In simple terms, the value of `gcd_val` is now the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` remain as described in the initial state, with `y` having been decremented by 1 from its previous value.
