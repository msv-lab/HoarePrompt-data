The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the given code. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list.**
