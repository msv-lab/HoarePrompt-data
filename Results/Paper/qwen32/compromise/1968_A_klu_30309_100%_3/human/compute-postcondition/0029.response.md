The code snippet provided sets `max_sum` to 0. This change affects the value of `max_sum` while all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000); `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `max_sum` is 0; `best_y` is the `y` that maximizes `gcd_val + y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `x` is the second element in `test_cases`**.
