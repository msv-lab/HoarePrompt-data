The code snippet assigns the value of `gcd_val + y` to `current_sum`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `gcd_val` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `current_sum`.

Output State: **`x` is at least 2; `y` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**
