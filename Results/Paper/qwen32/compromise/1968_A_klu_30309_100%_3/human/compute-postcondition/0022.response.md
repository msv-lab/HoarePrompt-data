The code assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`. The values of `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`x` is at least 2; `y` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**
