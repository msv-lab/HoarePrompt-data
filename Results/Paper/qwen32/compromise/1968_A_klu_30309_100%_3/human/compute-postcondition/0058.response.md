To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `y` and the range parameters `x - 1`, `0`, and `-1`.

The `for` loop will execute if the range `(x - 1, 0, -1)` is valid, meaning it should have at least one value to iterate over. This requires that `x - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Let's analyze the given state and required adjustments:

1. **`x` is the next element in `test_cases`**: This means `x` should be a value that can be obtained from `test_cases`. Since `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` should be a valid integer.
2. **`max_sum` is 0**: This state does not affect the execution of the loop.
3. **`best_y` is 1**: This state also does not affect the execution of the loop.
4. **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it**: This state does not affect the execution of the loop.

The critical requirement for the loop to execute is that `x - 1` should be greater than or equal to `0`. This means `x` should be at least `1`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `x` is at least `1`.

State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1**
