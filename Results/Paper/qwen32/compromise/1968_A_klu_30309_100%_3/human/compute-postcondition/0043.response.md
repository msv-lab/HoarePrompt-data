Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000); `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `x` is the second element in `test_cases`; `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`; `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`; `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`; `best_y` is `y`; `y` is `y - 1`.**

This means that the variable `best_y` is now equal to the value of `y` before the last operation, and `y` itself is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
