Postcondition: **`x` is at least 2; `y` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` and `best_y` is set to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `max_sum` or `best_y`.**
