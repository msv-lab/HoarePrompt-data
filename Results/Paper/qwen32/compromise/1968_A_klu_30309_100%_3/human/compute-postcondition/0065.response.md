Postcondition: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` and `best_y` is updated to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
