The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y`. The loop iterates from `x - 1` down to `1` with a step of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` was decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it.
- `test_cases` must have at least one more element.
- `x` must be at least 1.
- `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`.
- `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` and `best_y` is updated to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.

Since `y` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is `y - 1`**.
