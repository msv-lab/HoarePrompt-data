The code assigns the current value of `y` to the variable `best_y`. The values of the other variables (`x`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y` and the current value of `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`; `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`; `best_y` is equal to `y`.**
