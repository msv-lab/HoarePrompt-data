The code updates `gcd_val` to the greatest common divisor of `x` and the current value of `y`. The other variables (`current_sum`, `max_sum`, `best_y`) remain unchanged by this line of code.

Output State: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `y` is decremented by 1**.
