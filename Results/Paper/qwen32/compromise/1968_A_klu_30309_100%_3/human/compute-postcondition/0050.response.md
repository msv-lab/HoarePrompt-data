Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000); `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `x` is the second element in `test_cases`; `y` is `y + 1`; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; `best_y` is `y`.**

Explanation: The value of `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
