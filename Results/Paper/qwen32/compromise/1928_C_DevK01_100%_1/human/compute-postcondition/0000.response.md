Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `M` is initialized as an empty list, while the variable `q` remains unchanged as it was initially described.
