You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list `arr` of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500, and an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500 representing the length of the list `arr` plus one. It returns a list `ans` of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is `10 - arr[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-2` and `ans[n-1]` is `10`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
We need to find an array `a` of length `n` such that:
- `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`
- `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`

Given an array `x` of length `n-1`, the task is to construct an array `a` that satisfies the above conditions.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the array `x` of length `n-1`. It then calls the function `func_1(arr, n)` to generate the array `a`.

#### Function `func_1(arr, n)`:
- Initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to `10^9`.
- Iterates from the second last element to the first element of `ans` (i.e., from `i = n-2` to `i = 0`).
- For each `i`, it sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.

### Correctness Check
Let's evaluate if the function `func_1` correctly constructs the array `a`:

1. **Initialization**: The array `ans` is initialized with all elements set to `10^9`. This is a valid initial value as `10^9` is within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

2. **Iteration and Calculation**:
   - The function iterates from `i = n-2` down to `i = 0`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `ans[i]` as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.
   - This calculation ensures that `ans[i] % ans[i+1] == arr[i]` because `ans[i]` is chosen such that subtracting `arr[i]` from `ans[i+1]` results in `ans[i]`.

3. **Modulo Condition**:
   - The condition `ans[i] % ans[i+1] == arr[i]` should hold for all `2 <= i <= n`.
   - Given `ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]`, it follows that `ans[i] % ans[i+1] == (ans[i+1] - arr[i]) % ans[i+1] == -arr[i] % ans[i+1] == arr[i]` (since `arr[i] < ans[i+1]`).

4. **Range Constraint**:
   - The values in `ans` are calculated such that they remain within the range `[1, 10^9]` because the initial value is `10^9` and we are subtracting values from `x` which are at most `500`.

### Conclusion
The function `func_1` correctly constructs the array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. The program is correct.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
