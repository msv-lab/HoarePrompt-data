### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by constructing an array `a` such that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`. However, the implementation provided in `func_1` does not correctly achieve this.

Let's break down the given implementation:
1. `ans = [10 ** 9] * n`: This initializes the answer array `ans` with `n` elements, all set to `10^9`.
2. The while loop iterates from `n-2` down to `0`:
   - `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`: This line attempts to set `ans[i]` to be `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that `ans[i] % ans[i+1] = arr[i]`, and it can even result in negative values or values that do not satisfy the condition.
3. The function returns `ans`.

The provided implementation does not correctly compute the array `a` that satisfies the conditions given in the problem statement. Instead, it should construct `a` such that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`. A correct approach would be to set `a[1]` to a sufficiently large number (such as `10^9`) and then compute `a[i]` for `i >= 2` as `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i]` or any other valid value that satisfies the modulo condition.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the constructed array `a` satisfies the condition `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`.
