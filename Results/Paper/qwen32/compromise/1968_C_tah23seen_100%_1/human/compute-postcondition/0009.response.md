Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each element \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` must be at least 3; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is `10 - arr[i]` for `i` not equal to `n-3`, `ans[n-3]` is `ans[n-2] - arr[n-3]`, and all other elements are `10`; `i` is `n - 5`

The code snippet provided modifies the value of `ans[i]` based on the value of `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. Specifically, `ans[i]` is updated to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

Given that `i` is `n - 5`, the code updates `ans[n - 5]` to `ans[n - 4] - arr[n - 5]`.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` must be at least 3; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is `10 - arr[i]` for `i` not equal to `n-3` or `n-5`, `ans[n-3]` is `ans[n-2] - arr[n-3]`, `ans[n-5]` is `ans[n-4] - arr[n-5]`, and all other elements are `10`; `i` is `n - 5`**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans[n - 5]` is now `ans[n - 4] - arr[n - 5]`, while the rest of the conditions and values remain unchanged.
