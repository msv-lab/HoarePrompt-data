The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Initially, `i` is `n - 5`, so after the operation, `i` becomes `n - 6`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` must be at least 3; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is `10 - arr[i]` for `i` not equal to `n-3` or `n-5`, `ans[n-3]` is `ans[n-2] - arr[n-3]`, `ans[n-5]` is `ans[n-4] - arr[n-5]`, and all other elements are `10`; `i` is `n - 6`**.
