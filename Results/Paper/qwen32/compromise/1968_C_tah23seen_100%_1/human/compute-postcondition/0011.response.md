Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is `10 - arr[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-2` and `ans[n-1]` is `10`; `i` is `-1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `ans` list will have its first `n-1` elements updated such that each element at index `i` is `10 - arr[i]`. The last element of `ans` remains `10`. The loop variable `i` will be `-1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
