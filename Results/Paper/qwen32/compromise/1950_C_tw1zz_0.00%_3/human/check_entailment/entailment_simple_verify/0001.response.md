### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotated version and the provided problem description.

1. **Handling Midnight ('00:00')**:
   - According to the annotations and the code, when `h == '00'`, `h1` is set to `'12'` and `time` is set to `'PM'`. This is incorrect as midnight should be `'12:00 AM'`.

2. **Handling Noon ('12:00')**:
   - When `h == '12'`, `h1` is set to `'12'` and `time` is set to `'AM'`. This is incorrect as noon should be `'12:00 PM'`.

3. **Handling Other Hours**:
   - For hours from `'01'` to `'11'`, `h1` is correctly set to the same value as `h` and `time` is set to `'AM'`.
   - For hours from `'13'` to `'23'`, `h1` is correctly set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (e.g., `'13'` to `'01'`, `'14'` to `'02'`, etc.) and `time` is set to `'PM'`.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program correctly formats the output to include the leading zero for hours less than 10 and separates the hour, minute, and AM/PM with the correct formatting using `sep=''`.

5. **Redundancy**:
   - The code is indeed repetitive and can be simplified using arithmetic operations, but this does not affect the correctness of the output for the given test cases. The original assessment's suggestion to simplify the code is valid but not critical for correctness.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles the conversion for midnight ('00:00') and noon ('12:00'). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

### Final:
Final: **False**
