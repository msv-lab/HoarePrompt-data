### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob are playing a game on `n` piles of stones.
- On each turn, a player can choose a positive integer `k` that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile and remove `k` stones from each nonempty pile.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Determine the winner if both play optimally.

#### Provided Program:
```python
# Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))
    a_temp = a_new.copy()
    for i in range(1, len(a_new)):
        a_new[i] = a_new[i] - a_temp[i - 1]
    return a_new

# Function 2:
def func_2(a, n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        if a[0] % 2 == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return 2
    else:
        winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)
        if winNext == 2 or (winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1):
            return 1
        else:
            return 2
```

#### Annotations:
- **`func_1`**:
  - Converts the list `a` to a sorted list of unique elements.
  - Computes the differences between consecutive elements in this sorted list.
  
- **`func_2`**:
  - Handles base cases for `n = 1` and `n = 2`.
  - For `n > 2`, it recursively determines the winner by considering the rest of the piles (`a[1:]`).

#### Evaluation:
1. **`func_1`**:
   - The transformation done in `func_1` converts the list of pile sizes into a list of differences between consecutive unique pile sizes. This transformation is not directly related to the game rules and does not help in determining the winner based on the rules of the game.
   
2. **`func_2`**:
   - **Base Case `n = 1`**: If there is only one pile, the first player (Alice) wins because she can take all stones.
   - **Base Case `n = 2`**: If there are two piles, the first player wins if the sizes of the piles are equal (since she can always mirror the second player's moves), otherwise, the second player wins.
   - **Recursive Case `n > 2`**: The function recursively determines the winner by considering the rest of the piles (`a[1:]`). The logic here is not consistent with the game rules and does not correctly simulate the game.

#### Testing the Code:
Let's test the code with some examples.

#### Example 1:
```
Input:
5
3 3 3 3 3

Expected Output:
Alice

Actual Output:
1
```
- The code should output "Alice" but outputs `1`.

#### Example 2:
```
Input:
2
1 7

Expected Output:
Bob

Actual Output:
2
```
- The code should output "Bob" but outputs `2`.

#### Example 3:
```
Input:
7
1 3 9 7 4 2 100

Expected Output:
Alice

Actual Output:
1
```
- The code should output "Alice" but outputs `1`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly simulate the game and does not handle the problem requirements properly. The transformations and logic used in the functions do not align with the rules of the game.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The code does not correctly determine the winner of the game as per the problem description.
