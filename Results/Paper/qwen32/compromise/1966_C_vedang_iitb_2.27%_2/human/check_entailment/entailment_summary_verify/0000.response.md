### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not meet the problem description and does not correctly simulate the game rules. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Game Rules Simulation**:
   - The game involves players removing the same number of stones from each non-empty pile, up to the size of the smallest pile. The provided code does not simulate this process.
   - Instead, the code seems to be attempting to use a combinatorial game theory approach, which may be related to the Nim game or Grundy numbers, but it is not correctly implemented for this specific problem.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function converts the list of pile sizes to a sorted list of unique elements and then computes the differences between consecutive elements.
   - This transformation does not appear to be relevant to determining the game's outcome based on the rules given.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is intended to determine the winner based on the processed list of pile sizes.
   - The base cases and recursive logic do not correctly reflect the game rules. Specifically:
     - For `n = 1`, it always returns `1`, indicating the current player wins, which is not necessarily true.
     - For `n = 2`, it checks if the first pile size is even to determine the winner, which is an oversimplification and does not account for all scenarios.
     - For `n > 2`, it recursively determines the winner by considering the rest of the piles, but the logic is not consistent with the game rules.

4. **Testing the Code**:
   - The provided test cases show that the code does not produce the expected results. For example:
     - For the input `5 3 3 3 3 3`, the expected output is `Alice`, but the code outputs `1`.
     - For the input `2 1 7`, the expected output is `Bob`, but the code outputs `2`.
     - For the input `7 1 3 9 7 4 2 100`, the expected output is `Alice`, but the code outputs `1`.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. The logic in `func_2` and the transformation in `func_1` are not appropriate for determining the game's outcome based on the rules provided. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
