The code snippet calls a function `func_2` with the arguments `a[1:]` and `n - 1`, and assigns the result to the variable `winNext`. The list `a` is sliced to exclude the first element, and `n` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers and `n` is a non-negative integer with specific constraints (not equal to 1 or 2).

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, excluding the first pile; `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n - 1 <= len(a) - 1, and n - 1 is not equal to 0 or 1; `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`.**

In simpler terms, the list `a` now starts from the second element onward, `n` is reduced by 1, and `winNext` holds the result of the function `func_2` called with the modified list and decremented `n`.
