The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices of the list `a`.

Given that `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, the elements at even indices (considering 0-based indexing) are reversed in place.

Let's break this down:
- `a[::2]` selects all elements at even indices: 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the last even index.
- `a[::2][::-1]` takes these selected elements and reverses their order.

For example, if `a` was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, then `a[::2]` would be `[1, 3, 5]`, and `a[::2][::-1]` would be `[5, 3, 1]`. After the assignment, `a` becomes `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.

The value of `t` is not affected by this operation. The value of `n` is also not changed, but the list `a` is modified based on the described transformation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the integer input; `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with elements at even indices reversed.**
