Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It performs operations based on predefined constraints for multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 10^5, and the total sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case based on the value of `n`.**
