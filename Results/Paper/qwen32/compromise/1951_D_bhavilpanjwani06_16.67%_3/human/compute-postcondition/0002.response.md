The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides some context about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers read from the input, where 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}.
   - The current value of `n` is less than `k`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the string `'NO'`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because they are not referenced within it.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
