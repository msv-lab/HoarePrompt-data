The given initial state describes the values and constraints of the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`. Specifically, it states that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 10^18 inclusive, and `n` is equal to `k`.

The Python code snippet contains a single `print` statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement outputs the string `'YES'` directly, without any reference to the variables `t`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
