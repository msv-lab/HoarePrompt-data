The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` but does not affect the output of the `print` statement. Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to print `1`, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not influence the output.

Output: **1**
