To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (This variable `t` is not directly used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output).
- `n` and `k` are two positive integers read from the input, where 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k` (n >= k).
- `n` is not equal to `k` (n != k).
- `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1` (This condition can be simplified to k < (n + 1) / 2 or 2k < n + 1).

The print statement is:
```python
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

Let's break down the expression `n - k + 1`:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer, and it is less than `n`.
- Therefore, `n - k` is a positive integer.
- Adding 1 to `n - k` results in another positive integer.

The second part of the print statement is simply the integer `1`.

Based on the given conditions, the expression `n - k + 1` will always evaluate to a positive integer greater than 1 (since `n > k`).

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **n - k + 1, 1 (where n - k + 1 is a positive integer greater than 1)**

However, to be more precise and in line with the format specified:
Output: **n - k + 1, 1**
