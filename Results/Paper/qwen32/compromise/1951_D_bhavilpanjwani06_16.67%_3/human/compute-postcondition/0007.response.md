Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `n` and `k` are two positive integers where 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}
- `n` is equal to `k`

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(n)
```

Since `n` is explicitly defined to be equal to `k`, and no specific values for `n` or `k` are provided beyond their ranges, we can only describe `n` in terms of the given conditions. However, since `n` is guaranteed to be equal to `k`, and `k` is a positive integer within the specified range, `n` will also be a positive integer within that same range.

Output: **n (where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^{18} and n is equal to k)**
