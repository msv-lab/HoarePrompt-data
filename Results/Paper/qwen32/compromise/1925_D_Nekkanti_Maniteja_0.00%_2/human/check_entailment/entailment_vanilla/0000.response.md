Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective:** Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
- **Output:** The expected value as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers. Output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of three integers each: `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is the modulus for the final result.
   - `c` is set to the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\). However, the code incorrectly uses `n * (n - 1) // 1` instead of `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the sum of expected friendship values.
   - `a` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the sum of initial friendship values.

3. **Processing Friendships:**
   - For each friendship pair, the initial friendship value `f` is added to `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The program iterates `k` times, and in each iteration, it adds a calculated value to `s`. However, the formula used here seems incorrect.
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` appears to be an incorrect attempt to calculate the expected sum of friendship values.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Calculation of `c`:** The variable `c` should be the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), not `n * (n - 1) // 1`.
- **Incorrect Expected Value Calculation:** The formula used to update `s` in the loop is incorrect. It does not properly account for the increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.
- **Logic Flaw:** The logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the increase in friendship values for each pair over multiple excursions.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
