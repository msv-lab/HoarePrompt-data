### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` children and `m` pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value `f_i`.
- We perform `k` random selections of pairs of children.
- If a selected pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent selections.
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of the friendship values of all `k` selected pairs, and output this value as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` where `p/q` is the expected value in simplest form.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7`: The modulus value.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`: This is intended to be the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs `(n * (n - 1) // 2)`. However, it seems incorrect because the denominator should be `n * (n - 1) // 2`, not `n * (n - 1) // 1`. This could lead to incorrect results.
   - `s = 0`: This will store the sum of the expected friendship values.
   - `a = 0`: This will accumulate the sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs.

2. **Reading Friend Pairs:**
   - For each of the `m` friend pairs, we read `u, v, f` and add `f` to `a`.

3. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` is intended to calculate the expected sum of friendship values over `k` selections. The expression `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` seems incorrect and overly complicated. The intended logic is not clear.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints `s % M`, which is incorrect based on the above analysis.

#### Correct Approach:
- The expected value of a friend pair being selected in any given selection is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
- The expected contribution of a friend pair with initial friendship value `f` over `k` selections is `f * k + (k * (k - 1) // 2) * (1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2))`.
- The total expected value is the sum of these contributions for all friend pairs.
- The result should be expressed as a fraction `p/q` and then `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The modular inverse calculation and the expected value calculation are incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
