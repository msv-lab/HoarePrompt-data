You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initialization of `c`:**
   ```python
   c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
   ```
   The value of `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`. The code mistakenly uses `n * (n - 1) // 1` instead of `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This will result in an incorrect `c` value.

2. **Calculation of `s`:**
   The loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
   ```
   This loop attempts to accumulate the sum of expected friendship values over `k` excursions. However, the formula used here is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions should be calculated based on the probability of selecting each pair and the expected increase in their friendship values.

3. **Handling of friendship values:**
   The program reads the friendship values but does not use them correctly in the calculation of the expected sum. The friendship values `f_i` should be used to calculate the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over the `k` excursions.

4. **Modular arithmetic:**
   The program uses modular arithmetic correctly in places, but the overall logic is flawed due to the incorrect calculation of `c` and the incorrect formula for `s`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, you need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. This involves:

- Calculating the probability of selecting each pair of friends.
- Calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over `k` excursions.
- Summing these expected values to get the final result.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        prob = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        expected_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            # Expected increase in friendship value for this pair over k excursions
            expected_increase = (k * (k + 1) // 2) * prob
            expected_sum = (expected_sum + f * expected_increase) % M
        print(expected_sum)

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the expected sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, taking into account the probability of selecting each pair and the expected increase in their friendship values.
