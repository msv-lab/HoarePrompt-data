Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down why:

1. **Initialization of `c`**:
   ```python
   c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
   ```
   This line is intended to get the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs, `n * (n - 1) // 2`. However, `n * (n - 1) // 1` is not the correct expression for the total number of possible pairs. The correct expression should be `n * (n - 1) // 2`. The `// 1` does not change the value but is misleading.

2. **Summing up the initial friendship values**:
   ```python
   a = 0
   for i in range(m):
       u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
       a += f
   ```
   This part correctly sums up the initial friendship values of the friend pairs.

3. **Calculating the expected value**:
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
   ```
   This loop is incorrect and does not reflect the expected value calculation. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated based on the probability of choosing a friend pair and the expected increase in friendship values over the excursions. The provided loop seems to attempt to sum up some values but does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion and then summing these expected values over all excursions. This requires considering the probability of selecting a friend pair and the expected increase in their friendship value over the excursions.

Given the incorrect logic in the loop that calculates `s`, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
