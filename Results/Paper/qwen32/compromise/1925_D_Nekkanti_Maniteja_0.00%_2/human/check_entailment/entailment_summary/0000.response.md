Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to see if it aligns with the problem requirements and correctly computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

The problem requires us to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and the final answer should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

The provided solution seems to follow a different logic than what is required:

1. The solution calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is the number of possible pairs of children.
2. It then sums up the initial friendship values `a` of all friend pairs.
3. For `k` iterations, it updates `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`.

However, this approach does not correctly account for the increase in friendship values over time and the expected value calculation. The correct approach would involve calculating the expected value of the friendship value for each pair in each excursion and then summing these expected values.

The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions would involve considering the probability of each pair being chosen and the increase in their friendship value over time.

Given the problem's complexity and the need to handle large inputs efficiently, the provided solution appears to be incorrect in its logic and formula.

Correctness: **False**
