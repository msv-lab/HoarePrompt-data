Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is 0; `a` is 0; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is `k`.**

Natural Language: The variable `a` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
