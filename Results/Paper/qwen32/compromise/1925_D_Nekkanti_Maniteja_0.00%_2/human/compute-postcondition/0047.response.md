To determine the output of the `print(s % M)` statement, we need to understand the values and computations involved in the variables `s`, `c`, `M`, `m`, `k`, and `a`.

### Key Variables and Their Definitions:
- **`n`, `m`, `k`**: These are integers provided by user input, each at least 1.
- **`M`**: This is a constant integer `1000000007`.
- **`c`**: The modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`.
- **`s`**: This is a variable that accumulates a sum based on the formula:
  \[
  s = s + c \cdot (m + k - 1) \cdot m \cdot \frac{c^k - 1}{c - 1} + k \cdot c \cdot a
  \]
- **`a`**: This is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations.
- **`k`**: This integer is greater than 0.
- **`i`**: This variable is defined as `m + k - 1`.

### Computation Steps:
1. **`c` Calculation**:
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`. This means `c` is a number such that:
     \[
     (n \cdot (n - 1) \cdot c) \equiv 1 \pmod{1000000007}
     \]

2. **`s` Calculation**:
   - `s` is updated in each iteration based on the formula provided. The exact value of `s` depends on the values of `c`, `m`, `k`, and `a`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The statement `print(s % M)` will print the value of `s` modulo `1000000007`.

### Explanation of the Output:
Given the complexity of the formula and the fact that the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables involved.

The final output will be the value of `s` modulo `1000000007`. This value is computed based on the formula provided and the initial and intermediate values of the variables.

### Final Answer:
Output: **s % M (where s is computed based on the formula and M is 1000000007)**
