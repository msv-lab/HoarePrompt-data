The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these two variables for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m + k`. Since the loop is `for i in range(k)`, the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `m + k`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `m + k + 1`.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged as it defines the range of the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`; `a` is `sum_f`; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is `m + k + 1`**
