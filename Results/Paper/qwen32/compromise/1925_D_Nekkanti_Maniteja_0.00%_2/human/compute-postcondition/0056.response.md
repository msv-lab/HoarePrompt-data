Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is 0; `a` is `f`; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `u`, `v`, and `f` are the three integers provided by the user input.**

The value of `a` is updated to be equal to `f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
