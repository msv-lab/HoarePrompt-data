Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the number of people `n`, the number of friend pairs `m`, and a threshold `k`. It sums up the strengths of the friend pairs and uses these values to compute `s` through a specific formula, taking into account modular arithmetic with a large prime number. The function outputs the result of `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) for each test case.**
