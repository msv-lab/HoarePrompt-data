The code calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` under the modulus `M`. Given that `n` is at least 1, the expression `n * (n - 1) // 1` simplifies to `n * (n - 1)`. The variable `c` is then assigned the value of the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integer values provided by the user's input, which are at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`.**
