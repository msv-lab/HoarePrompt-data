The code snippet reads three integers from the user's input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial state of other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integer values provided by the user's input, which are at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is 0; `a` is 0; `m` must be greater than 0; `u`, `v`, and `f` are the three integers provided by the user's input.**
