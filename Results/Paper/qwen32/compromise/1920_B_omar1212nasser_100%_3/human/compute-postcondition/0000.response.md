The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `pos`. This action does not affect the values of `removals`, `negatives`, or `elements`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `pos` as an empty list while maintaining the preconditions for the other variables.

Output State: **removals and negatives are non-negative integers, elements is a list of non-negative integers. The length of elements is at least the maximum of removals and negatives. `pos` is an empty list.**
