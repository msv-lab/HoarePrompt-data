The variable `s` is assigned the value of the sum of the list `elements`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, and `pos` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers, the length of `elements` is at least the maximum of `removals` and `negatives`, `pos` is an empty list, `s` is the sum of `elements`.**
