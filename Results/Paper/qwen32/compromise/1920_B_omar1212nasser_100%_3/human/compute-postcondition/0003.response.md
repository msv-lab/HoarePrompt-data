The code calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` and assigns it to the variable `s2`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers, the length of `elements` is at least the maximum of `removals` and `negatives`, `pos` is a list containing one element `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of `elements[-negatives:]`.**
