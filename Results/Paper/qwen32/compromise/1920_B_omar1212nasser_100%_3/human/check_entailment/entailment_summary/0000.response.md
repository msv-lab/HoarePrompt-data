### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to ensure that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together meet the problem description correctly.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list `a` of `n` positive integers.
   - It sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
   - It then calls `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a` to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after Alice and Bob's moves.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum after Alice can remove up to `removals` elements and Bob can multiply up to `negatives` elements by -1.
   - It starts by computing the sum of all elements `s` and the sum of the last `negatives` elements `s2` (which are the largest elements after sorting).
   - It then computes the initial potential sum after Bob's moves by subtracting twice the sum of the largest `negatives` elements from `s` (since flipping these elements would subtract twice their value from the sum).
   - It iteratively adjusts the sum `s` by removing the largest elements (since Alice would remove the largest elements to maximize the sum) and updates `s2` accordingly.
   - It keeps track of these potential sums in the list `pos` and returns the maximum value from this list.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting**: The array is sorted in ascending order, which is crucial for both Alice and Bob to make optimal decisions. Alice removes the largest elements, and Bob flips the smallest elements after Alice's removals.
- **Computation of `pos`**:
  - The function starts with the assumption that Bob flips the `negatives` largest elements.
  - It then iteratively considers the scenario where Alice removes one more element and adjusts Bob's flips accordingly.
  - The key point here is that the function correctly computes the potential sums by considering all possible combinations of Alice's removals and Bob's flips.

### Conclusion:

The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. They handle the input correctly, compute the potential sums after Alice's removals and Bob's flips, and return the optimal result for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
