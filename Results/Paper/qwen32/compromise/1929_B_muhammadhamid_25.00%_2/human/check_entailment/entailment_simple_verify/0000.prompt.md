You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) — the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

    #State: The output state consists of t lines, each containing the minimum number of rows that need to be colored to ensure that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell in an n x n grid. For each test case, if k is 1, the output is 1. If k is less than or equal to 2 * n, the output is the ceiling of k divided by 2. Otherwise, the output is k divided by 2 plus one.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze whether it meets the problem description for all potential cases. The program aims to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell.

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify it against the problem requirements.

### Program Analysis
The program handles three main cases:
1. If \( k == 1 \), it prints 1.
2. If \( k \leq 2n \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
3. If \( k > 2n \), it prints \( \lfloor \frac{k}{2} \rfloor + 1 \).

### Verification Against Problem Requirements
The problem involves counting diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid. There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total:
- \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right.
- \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.

#### Case 1: \( k == 1 \)
- The program correctly outputs 1, which is the minimum number of cells needed to color one diagonal.

#### Case 2: \( k \leq 2n \)
- The program outputs \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
- This logic is correct because for \( k \leq 2n \), we can color cells such that each diagonal is covered with a minimal number of cells. For example, coloring cells along every second diagonal (either top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left) will ensure that \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) cells are sufficient.

#### Case 3: \( k > 2n \)
- The program outputs \( \lfloor \frac{k}{2} \rfloor + 1 \).
- This logic is also correct because when \( k > 2n \), we need to cover more diagonals, and the formula ensures that we cover all required diagonals with the minimum number of cells.

### Testing with Examples
Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input:** 3 4
   - \( k = 4 \leq 2 \times 3 \)
   - Output: \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
   - Correct.

2. **Input:** 3 3
   - \( k = 3 \leq 2 \times 3 \)
   - Output: \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
   - Correct.

3. **Input:** 3 10
   - \( k = 10 > 2 \times 3 \)
   - Output: \( \lfloor \frac{10}{2} \rfloor + 1 = 6 \)
   - Correct.

4. **Input:** 3 9
   - \( k = 9 > 2 \times 3 \)
   - Output: \( \lfloor \frac{9}{2} \rfloor + 1 = 5 \)
   - Correct.

5. **Input:** 4 7
   - \( k = 7 > 2 \times 4 \)
   - Output: \( \lfloor \frac{7}{2} \rfloor + 1 = 4 \)
   - Correct.

6. **Input:** 7 11
   - \( k = 11 > 2 \times 7 \)
   - Output: \( \lfloor \frac{11}{2} \rfloor + 1 = 6 \)
   - Correct.

7. **Input:** 2 3
   - \( k = 3 > 2 \times 2 \)
   - Output: \( \lfloor \frac{3}{2} \rfloor + 1 = 2 \)
   - Correct.

The program seems to work correctly for the provided examples and the logic appears sound for all potential cases.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and testing, the program meets the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
