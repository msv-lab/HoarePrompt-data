Output State: **The output state consists of t lines, each containing the minimum number of rows that need to be colored to ensure that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell in an n x n grid. For each test case, if k is 1, the output is 1. If k is less than or equal to 2 * n, the output is the ceiling of k divided by 2. Otherwise, the output is k divided by 2 plus one.**
