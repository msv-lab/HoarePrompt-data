### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Task**: The task is to determine which character ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each of `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a string of length 5 made up of 'A's and 'B's.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case, reading a string `s` of length 5.

3. **Counting Characters**: For each string `s`, the program initializes two counters, `ac` and `bc`, to zero. It then iterates through each character in the string:
   - If the character is 'A', it increments `ac`.
   - Otherwise, it increments `bc`.

4. **Determining the Most Frequent Character**: After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, the program compares the two counts:
   - If `ac` (the count of 'A's) is greater than `bc` (the count of 'B's), it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

5. **Handling Equal Counts**: The program defaults to printing 'B' when `ac` equals `bc`. While the problem description does not specify what to do in this scenario, the provided example suggests that 'B' should be printed when the counts are equal. Therefore, the program's behavior aligns with the example provided.

6. **Output**: The program outputs the most frequent character for each test case, separated by newlines, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the most frequent character in each test case string. It handles the input as specified and produces the correct output based on the given examples. The handling of equal counts, although not explicitly defined in the problem statement, is consistent with the provided examples.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.

**Final: True**
