You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` distinct strings of length 5 consisting solely of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each string, it determines whether the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's and prints 'A' if true, otherwise it prints 'B'. After processing all test cases, the output consists of `t` lines, each indicating the result ('A' or 'B') for the corresponding test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. According to the problem description, the program should output either 'A' or 'B' based on which one appears more frequently. However, if the counts are equal, the program will always output 'B', which is not specified in the problem description. 

For example, consider the input string "AABBB" and "ABBBA". Both strings have 3 'A's and 2 'B's, but the program will output 'B' for both, which is incorrect because the problem does not specify what to do when the counts are equal. It only specifies which letter to output when one appears more frequently than the other.

To fix this, the program should handle the tie case explicitly, either by choosing one of the letters consistently or by specifying additional rules for ties. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        elif bc > ac:
            print('B')
        else:
            # Handle the tie case, for example, choose 'A' or 'B' consistently
            print('A')  # or print('B'), depending on the desired behavior
```

This version ensures that the program handles all possible cases, including ties, as required by the problem description.
