### Reasoning:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine which letter ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each of the given strings. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 consisting of characters 'A' and 'B'.

2. **Counting Characters:**
   - It initializes two counters, `ac` and `bc`, to zero. These counters will keep track of the number of occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`. If the character is 'A', it increments `ac`. Otherwise, it increments `bc`.

3. **Determining the Most Frequent Character:**
   - After counting the characters in the string, the program compares `ac` and `bc`.
   - If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A', indicating that 'A' appears more frequently in the string.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B', indicating that 'B' appears more frequently or that both appear equally often (in which case the program defaults to printing 'B').

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - Since the problem specifies that the string length is exactly 5 and consists only of 'A' and 'B', the program does not need to handle any invalid input scenarios.
   - The program also handles the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal by defaulting to 'B', which is acceptable according to the problem statement.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the result for each test case on a new line, as required.

Given the provided example and the logic of the program, the program correctly determines the most frequent character for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example.
