Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previously processed character; `bc` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `bc` has been increased by 1, while the values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.
