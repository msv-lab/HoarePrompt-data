Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives a distinct string of length 5 consisting solely of the characters 'A' and 'B'. The function then processes these strings and returns a result for each test case.**
