The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on the value of the current character from the string `s`. Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to the next character in the string.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string and `i` has just finished processing the current character, the next state of `i` would be the next character in the string `s`.

Since we don't have specific information about the length of `s` or its exact characters beyond the fact that `i` has just processed one of them, we can only describe the state in terms of the next character in the sequence.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32; `s` is a non-empty string; `q` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next character in the string `s`; if `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 0. Otherwise, `i` is not 'A', `ac` is 0, and `bc` is 1.**
