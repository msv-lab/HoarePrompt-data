The code snippet increments the variable `i` by 1. This change affects only the variable `i` while all other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string that is being built based on the conditions described and now includes the character `a[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1 and must still be less than `len(a)`; `work` is a boolean flag that determines how `ans` is updated and whether `i` is incremented.**
