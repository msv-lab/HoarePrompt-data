Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace and at least 2 characters; `b` is a string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string constructed based on the conditions described; `i` is equal to `len(a)`; `work` is a boolean flag that can be either True or False; `j` is `len(a) - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
