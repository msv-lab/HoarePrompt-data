The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace and `a` is not an empty string; `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `work` is False; `j` is len(a) - 1; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matches of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` until the loop breaks or completes; `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b` and now also includes `b[i]`; `i` is such that `i < len(a)` and `i` is incremented by 1.**
