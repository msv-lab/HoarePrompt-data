Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string constructed based on the conditions described; `i` is equal to `len(a)`; `work` is a boolean flag that can be either True or False; `j` is `len(a) - 1`; `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to an input integer, while all other variables retain their initial values.
