Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `i` has been initialized to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `ans`) retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
