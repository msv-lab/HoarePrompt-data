Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `a`; `i` is equal to 1; `work` is True; `j` is `len(a) - 1`; `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop; `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`.**

In the output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now equal to 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
