Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is 0; `work` is True; `j` is len(a) - 1; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matches of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` until the loop breaks or completes.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace and `a` is not an empty string; `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `work` is False; `j` is len(a) - 1; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matches of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` until the loop breaks or completes. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is the first character of `a`; otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b`. `i` is 1 if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `i` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace and `a` is not an empty string; `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `work` is False; `j` is len(a) - 1; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matches of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` until the loop breaks or completes; `i` is such that `i < len(a)` and `i` is incremented by 1. If `work` is True, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `a[i]` if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `b[i]` if `i + 1 == len(a)`, otherwise `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `a[i]` and `i` is increased by 1. If `work` is False, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b` and now also includes `b[i]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace and `a` is not an empty string; `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `work` is False; `j` is len(a) - 1; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matches of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` until the loop breaks or completes; `i` is such that `i < len(a) - 1` or `i + 1 == len(a)`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include `a[i]` and `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`. If `work` is False, `i` is increased by 1 and `ans` has been updated to include `b[i]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
