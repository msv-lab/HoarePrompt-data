Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains the first character of `a`; `i` is 0 if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `i` is 1; `work` is True and the current value of `work` is True. Additionally, if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`.**
