The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 0, so after the increment, `i` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `b`; `i` is 1; `work` is False**
