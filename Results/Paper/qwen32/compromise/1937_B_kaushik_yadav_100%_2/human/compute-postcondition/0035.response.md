The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`; `i` and `work` are determined based on the value of `work`, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`; `i` is increased by 1; `work` is determined based on the value of `work`.**
