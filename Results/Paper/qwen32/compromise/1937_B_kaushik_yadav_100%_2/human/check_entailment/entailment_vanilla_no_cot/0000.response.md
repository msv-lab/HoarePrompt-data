Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Specifically, the program does not correctly determine the best path when it can switch rows and does not accurately count the number of paths that produce the lexicographically smallest string.

Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Path Selection**:
   - The program attempts to switch rows when it sees that the element in the second row is smaller than the next element in the first row. However, this logic is not sufficient to ensure the lexicographically smallest string. The decision to switch rows should be based on a more thorough comparison of the remaining paths.

2. **Path Counting**:
   - The counting of paths is incorrect. The logic used only considers consecutive equal elements in the two rows and breaks when it encounters a different element. This does not account for all possible paths that yield the smallest string.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to use dynamic programming to keep track of the lexicographically smallest path and the number of ways to achieve it at each step. Here is a sketch of the correct approach:

- Use two arrays `dp_min` and `dp_count` where `dp_min[i][j]` is the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed up to cell `(i, j)` and `dp_count[i][j]` is the number of ways to achieve this string.
- Initialize the starting point `(1, 1)` with the value of cell `(1, 1)` and count `1`.
- Iterate through the grid, updating `dp_min` and `dp_count` based on the lexicographically smaller string and the number of ways to achieve it by moving right or down.
- The final result will be in `dp_min[2][n]` and `dp_count[2][n]`.

This approach ensures that you correctly find the lexicographically smallest string and count all paths that yield this string.
