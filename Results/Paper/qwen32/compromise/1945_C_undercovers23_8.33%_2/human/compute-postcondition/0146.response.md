Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4 (after being decremented by 1 from the previous state), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the user input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `mini` is 0, `zero` is 3, `one` is 3, `lst` is [1, 3, 5], and `final` is [7] if `c1` is less than 50. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is [0].**
