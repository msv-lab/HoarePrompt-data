To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(final[0])`, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `final` is initially a sorted list of all elements in `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. 
   - If `final` is empty, it gets updated to `[0]` if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or to `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50.
   - `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n`.

2. **Logic**:
   - First, `final` is populated with elements from `lst` that satisfy the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
   - If no such elements exist (i.e., `final` is empty), `final` is set to either `[0]` or `[n]` based on the value of `c1`.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - Since the print statement is `print(final[0])`, we need to know the first element of `final`.
   - If `final` was not empty after the first step, `final[0]` would be the smallest element from `lst` that satisfies `abs(pk - elem) == mini` (since `final` is sorted).
   - If `final` was empty and got updated, `final[0]` would be either `0` or `n` depending on whether `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50.

Given the above steps, we can summarize the output as follows:

- If `final` was not empty, `final[0]` is the smallest element in `lst` that satisfies `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
- If `final` was empty, `final[0]` is `0` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` if `c1` is less than 50.

Thus, the output depends on the contents of `lst` and the values of `pk`, `elem`, `mini`, `o`, and `n`.

Output: **final[0] (where final[0] is the smallest element in lst that satisfies abs(pk - elem) == mini, or 0 if c1 >= 50, or n if c1 < 50)**
