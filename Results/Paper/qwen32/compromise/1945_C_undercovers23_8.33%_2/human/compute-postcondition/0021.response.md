The given code snippet calculates the percentage of zeros encountered so far in the string `s` up to the index `i` and assigns it to the variable `zero_perc`. The calculation involves multiplying the count of zeros (`zero`) by 100, dividing by the number of elements considered so far (`i + 1`), and then taking the ceiling of the result.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `zero_perc`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, and if `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0; otherwise, `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.**
