The code appends the variable `elem` to the list `final`. This means that `final` now contains `elem` as an additional element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the user input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in `s`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the count of '1's in `s`, `lst` is a non-empty list, `elem` is the next element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing `elem`**
