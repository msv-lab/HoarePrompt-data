The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 5, `i + 1` equals 6. Therefore, `lst` will now contain the value 6.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 4, `z` is 3, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 6)`, `one_perc` is 400, `lst` is [6], `i` is 5, and `zero` is `previous_value_of_zero` + 1 if `s[i]` is '0'.**
