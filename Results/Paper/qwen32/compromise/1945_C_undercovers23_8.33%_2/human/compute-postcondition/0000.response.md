`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
