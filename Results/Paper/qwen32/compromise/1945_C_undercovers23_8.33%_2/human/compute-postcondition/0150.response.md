The code snippet resets the variables `zero` and `one` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4 (after being decremented by 1 from the previous state), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the user input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in `s`, `mini` is 0, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is [1, 3, 5], and `final` is [7] if `c1` is less than 50. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is [0].**
