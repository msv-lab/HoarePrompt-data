The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. This means the previous value of `n` (which was an integer between 3 and 3·10^5) is replaced by the new input value. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is the input integer, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'**.
