The code snippet converts the input string `s` into a list of characters and assigns it to the variable `sl`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, or `pk`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`.**
