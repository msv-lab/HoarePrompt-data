The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Given the initial state, `elem` is 4, and `final` is initially an empty list `[]`. After appending `elem` to `final`, `final` becomes `[4]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 6, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is `n // 2` which is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` which is 3, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` which is 3, `zero` is 3, `one` is 2, `lst` is [2, 4], `mini` is 1, `elem` is 4, `final` is [4]**.
