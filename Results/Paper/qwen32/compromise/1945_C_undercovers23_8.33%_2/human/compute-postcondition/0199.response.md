To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `final` list based on the given conditions.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `elem` in the list `lst`.
- For each `elem`, it checks if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
- If the condition is true, it appends `elem` to the `final` list.

### Key Points:
- `pk` is defined as `n // 2`.
- `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.
- `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50. However, the specific values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are not directly relevant to the loop's operation since they are not used within the loop itself.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the `final` list will contain all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. This means that `final` will include all indices in `lst` that have the smallest absolute difference with `pk`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state of the `final` list will be a list of all elements in `lst` that satisfy the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

### Output State Format:
Output State: **final is a list of all elements in lst where abs(pk - elem) == mini.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the `final` list will contain all indices from `lst` that have the smallest absolute difference with `pk`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial definitions.
