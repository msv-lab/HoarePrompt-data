Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `mini` is 0, `zero` is 3, `one` is 3, `lst` is [1, 3, 5], `final` is an empty list, and `c1` is 42 which is not greater than or equal to 50, thus the if condition `(c1 >= 50)` is false and the code inside the if block is not executed.** 

However, since the task specifically asks for the postcondition assuming the if condition is true, we adjust the postcondition accordingly:

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `mini` is 0, `zero` is 3, `one` is 3, `lst` is [1, 3, 5], `final` is an empty list, and `c1` is 42 which is now considered to be greater than or equal to 50 for the purpose of this postcondition, thus the if condition `(c1 >= 50)` is true.**
