The given Python code initializes two variables, `zero` and `one`, both set to 0. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`). Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the new variables `zero` and `one`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0.**
