To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```
while j < len(s) - 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(s) - 1`. 

From the state description:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500 (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `s` is a newly input string with length at least `j + 1`.
- `count` is either 2 or 3 (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `flag` is True if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `j` is incremented by 1 during each iteration.
- `i` is `len(s)` (irrelevant to the loop condition).

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(s) - 1`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 during each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be such that `j < len(s) - 1` holds true.

Given that `s` is a string with length at least `j + 1`, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `len(s) - 1`. This means `j` should be less than or equal to `len(s) - 2`.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, to allow another iteration, `j` must be adjusted to a value that satisfies `j < len(s) - 1`.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed if `j` is already less than `len(s) - 1` after the previous iteration. However, if we want to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we should adjust `j` to be less than `len(s) - 1`.

Let's assume `j` is currently `len(s) - 2` or less, which would allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a newly input string with length at least `j + 1`; `count` is either 2 or 3; `flag` is True if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is less than `len(s) - 1`; `i` is `len(s)`**
