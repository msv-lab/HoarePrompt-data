Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the input string; `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in `s` minus 1; `flag` is True indicating there is at least one '0' followed by '1' in `s`; `j` is `len(s) - 1` or `len(s)`; `i` is `len(s) + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `count` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
