The code snippet assigns the value of `z` to `z_r`. Therefore, `z_r` now holds the same value as `z`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new input string, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is the position closest to the midpoint where the conditions are met, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `b_d` is the minimum distance to the midpoint where the conditions are met**.
