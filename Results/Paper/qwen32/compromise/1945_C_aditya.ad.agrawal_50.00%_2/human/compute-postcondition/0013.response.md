The code snippet assigns the value of `dist` to `b_d`. The value of `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, and this value is now also assigned to `b_d`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting a character from `input_string` to an integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o_r` is equal to `o`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 0; `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`; `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`**.
