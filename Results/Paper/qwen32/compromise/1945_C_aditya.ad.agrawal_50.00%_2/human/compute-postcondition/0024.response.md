The value of `o_r` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string with at least one character; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o_r` is equal to the previous `o_r` minus 1; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 1; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 1; `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`; otherwise, `b_d` is 30001`; `i` is not equal to 0.
