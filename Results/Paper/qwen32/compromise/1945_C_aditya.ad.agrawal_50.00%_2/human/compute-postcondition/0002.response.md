`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains as it was before, and it must still be greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer**
