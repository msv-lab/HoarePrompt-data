Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string with at least one character, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `i` is `arr[pos]`, `z_l` is increased by 1, `z_r` is counts related to 0s, `o_l` and `o_r` are counts related to 1s, `pos` is increased by 1, `o_r`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `dist`, `b_d`, and `ans` are adjusted based on the new value of `i`.**

In simple terms, the variable `z_l` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
