The code snippet provided is simply assigning the value of `pos` to `ans`. No other variables are modified in the given code. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `ans`, which now holds the value of `pos`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string with at least one character, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `i` is `arr[pos]`, `pos` is increased by 1, `dist`, `b_d`, and `ans` are adjusted based on the new value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1. `ans` is now equal to `pos`.**
