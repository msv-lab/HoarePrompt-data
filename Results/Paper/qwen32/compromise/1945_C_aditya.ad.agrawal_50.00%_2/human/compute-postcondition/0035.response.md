Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string with at least one character; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`. `i` is the next element in `arr`. `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `b_d`, and `ans` remain as per their definitions based on the new value of `i`. `pos` is increased by 1; `o_l` is incremented by 1; `o_r` is decremented by 1.**

In simple terms: The value of `o_r` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged except for `pos` which is increased by 1 and `o_l` which is incremented by 1.
