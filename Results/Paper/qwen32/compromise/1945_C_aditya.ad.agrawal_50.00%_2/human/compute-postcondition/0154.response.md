Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s. Each character in the string `a` indicates the preference of the resident of the corresponding house: 0 for the left side of the street and 1 for the right side. The function returns the count of residents who want to live on the left side and the count of residents who want to live on the right side for each test case.**
