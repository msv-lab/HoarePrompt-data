Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string with at least one character; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`. If `i` is 0, then `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` remains the same, `z_l` is 1, and `o_l` is 0. If `i` is not 0, then `z_r` remains the same, `o_r` is the previous `o_r` minus 1, `z_l` is 0, and `o_l` is 1. In both cases, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 1, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
