The code snippet provided is `o_r -= 1`, which decrements the value of `o_r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the description provided. Therefore, the only affected variable here is `o_r`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string with at least one character, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `i` is `arr[pos]`, `z_l` and `z_r` are counts related to 0s, `o_l` is incremented by 1, `o_r` is decremented by 1, `z_r` are counts related to 1s and 0s respectively, `dist`, `b_d`, and `ans` are adjusted based on the new value of `i`, `pos` is increased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `o_r` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
