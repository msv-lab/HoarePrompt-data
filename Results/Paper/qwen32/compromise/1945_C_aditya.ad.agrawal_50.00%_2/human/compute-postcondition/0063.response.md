The code snippet provided reassigns values to the variables `dist`, `ans`, and `pos`. Here's how the variables are updated:

- `dist` is reassigned to `abs(n / 2)`. This value is the same as the initial value of `dist`, so it remains unchanged in terms of the expression but is explicitly set again.
- `ans` is set to `0`.
- `pos` is set to `0`.

All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is updated to the input string; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 0; `b_d` is the minimum distance from `n / 2` to any position `pos` where the conditions were met; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`.**
