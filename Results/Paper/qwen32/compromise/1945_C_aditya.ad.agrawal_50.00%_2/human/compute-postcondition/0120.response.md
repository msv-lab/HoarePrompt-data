Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new input string, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, then `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001. Additionally, the current value of `i` is 0.**

Natural Language: The value of `z_l` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
