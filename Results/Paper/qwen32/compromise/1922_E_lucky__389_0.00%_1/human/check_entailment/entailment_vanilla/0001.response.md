Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
The problem requires us to construct an array of integers with at most 200 elements such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If it's not possible, we should output `-1`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X` which represents the number of increasing subsequences required.

2. **Adjusting `X`:**
   - The program starts by subtracting 1 from `X`. This is because the empty subsequence is always counted, so we need `X - 1` non-empty increasing subsequences.

3. **Finding Subsequence Lengths:**
   - The program uses a while loop to find the lengths of increasing subsequences that contribute to the total count `X`.
   - It calculates the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `X + 1` and appends the exponent to the list `subseq_lens`.
   - It then subtracts `2^i - 1` from `X` and updates the maximum length `mx` found so far.

4. **Constructing the Array:**
   - The program initializes the array `ansv` with values from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - It then appends the remaining lengths in `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Handling of `X`:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case when `X` is a power of 2. For example, if `X` is 2, the program should output an array with 1 element, but it outputs an array with 2 elements.
   - The logic for breaking down `X` into sums of `(2^i - 1)` is not optimal and may not always produce the correct array.

2. **Generating the Array:**
   - The logic to generate the array `ansv` from the `subseq_lens` is flawed. The array should be constructed in such a way that it produces exactly `X` increasing subsequences, which the current implementation does not guarantee.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as very large values of `X` or specific values that require a specific array structure.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly solve the problem for all possible values of `X`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
