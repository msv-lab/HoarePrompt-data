You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.

    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, x is 0, subseq_lens is [3, 3, 4], mx is 4, ansv is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 6
    for i in range(len(ansv)):

    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the input, processes it to determine a sequence of subsequence lengths, and then outputs the length of a derived list `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values explicitly; instead, it prints the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array for every valid input X that has exactly X increasing subsequences. The approach taken in the code is flawed and does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will match the input X for all cases.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequence Lengths**:
   - The code attempts to decompose X-1 into sums of powers of 2, which is not a correct approach to generate the required array. The number of increasing subsequences for a given array is not simply related to powers of 2 in the way the code assumes.

2. **Array Construction**:
   - The array construction logic does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly X. The code appends elements based on the powers of 2 calculated, but this does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, for X = 5, the code might not generate an array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences. Similarly, for larger values of X, the generated array might not meet the requirement.

### Example of Failure:
Let's consider the input X = 5. According to the problem description, we need to generate an array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences. The code might generate an array like `[0, 1, 0]` which has 3 increasing subsequences: `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[0, 1]`. This does not meet the requirement of having exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one needs to understand how the number of increasing subsequences is calculated for a given array and construct the array accordingly. A known approach involves using binary representation and specific patterns to ensure the correct number of subsequences.

Given the issues identified, the provided code is not correct for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
