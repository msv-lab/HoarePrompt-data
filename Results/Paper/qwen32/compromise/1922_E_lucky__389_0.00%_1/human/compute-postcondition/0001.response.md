The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^18, after decrementing, `x` will be in the range 1 <= x <= 10^18 - 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^18 - 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^18 - 1.**
