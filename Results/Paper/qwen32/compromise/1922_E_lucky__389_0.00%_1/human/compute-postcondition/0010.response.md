To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x` in this case. The condition for the loop to execute is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `x` is an integer such that 7 <= x <= 10^18 - 1
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `mx` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `i` is 2

The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so the condition becomes `2 ** (2 + 1) <= x + 1`, which simplifies to `8 <= x + 1` or `x >= 7`. Since `x` is already given to be at least 7, this condition is satisfied.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented, and the new condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` must hold true. If `i` is incremented to 3, the condition becomes `2 ** (3 + 1) <= x + 1`, which simplifies to `16 <= x + 1` or `x >= 15`.

So, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `x` must be at least 15. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` must be at least 15, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 3**
