The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 - 1. Since `x` is within this range, it is not equal to 0, and the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 - 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`**
