To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the condition under which the loop terminates. The loop continues as long as `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

Let's analyze the given output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `x` must be at least 2; `i` is 1
- After 2 iterations: `x` must be at least 3; `i` is 2
- After 3 iterations: `x` must be at least 15; `i` is 3

We can deduce that the loop will terminate when `2 ** (i + 1) > x + 1`.

Let's find the maximum value of `i` for a given `x` by solving the inequality:
\[ 2 ** (i + 1) > x + 1 \]

For `i = 3`, the condition is `2 ** 4 > x + 1`, which simplifies to `16 > x + 1` or `15 > x`. So, `x` must be less than 15 for the loop to run exactly 3 iterations. If `x` is 15 or more, the loop will run more iterations.

Let's consider the next iteration:
- For `i = 4`, the condition is `2 ** 5 > x + 1`, which simplifies to `32 > x + 1` or `31 > x`. So, `x` must be less than 31 for the loop to run exactly 4 iterations.

Continuing this pattern, we see that the loop will terminate when `2 ** (i + 1) > x + 1`. The maximum `i` for a given `x` will be the largest integer such that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

Given the output states, we can infer that the loop will terminate when `x` is such that the next power of 2 exceeds `x + 1`. For example, if `x` is 31, the loop will run 4 iterations, and `i` will be 4.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be when `2 ** (i + 1)` is just greater than `x + 1`.

Let's assume the maximum `x` given the pattern is 31, then the loop will run 4 iterations, and `i` will be 4.

Output State: **x is at least 15; i is 4.**

In natural language: The final output state is when `x` is at least 15, and `i` is 4, meaning the loop has run all its iterations and `i` has been incremented to 4.
