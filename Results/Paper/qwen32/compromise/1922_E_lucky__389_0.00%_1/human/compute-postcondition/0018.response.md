The provided code snippet is `mx = max(mx, i)`. This line of code updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. The initial state does not provide a value for `i` or `mx`, so we can only describe the general impact of this line on the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 - 3

The variable `mx` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since the initial value of `mx` is not provided, we can only say that after this line executes, `mx` will hold the maximum value between its previous value and `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 - 3, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
