To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `len(pans)`. The loop will execute if `len(pans)` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `len(pans)`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `mak` is 0
- `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received
- `pans` contains all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and the last index `i` for which the input was '<' if such an input was received
- `n` remains unchanged

The only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `len(pans)`. Since `i` is the loop variable and its initial value is determined by the range function, we need to ensure that `len(pans)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `pans` has at least two elements.

State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received, `pans` contains at least two elements, `n` remains unchanged**
