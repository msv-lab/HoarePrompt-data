Let's break down the given information and determine the values of the variables that will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **mak**: The value of `mak` is determined by the input string:
   - If the input string is `'<'`, then `mak` is set to `i`.
   - Otherwise, `mak` remains `0`.
2. **mak2**: Remains unchanged from its initial value.
3. **pans**: Remains unchanged from its initial value.
4. **i**: The value of `i` is incremented by `1` from its initial value.
5. **n**: It is mentioned that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, but this does not affect the current state directly.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```
This means we need to determine the values of `mak` and `i` at the time of execution.

- **mak**: As per the initial state, `mak` is either `i` (if the input string is `'<'`) or `0` (otherwise).
- **i**: The value of `i` is incremented by `1` from its initial value.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initial Value of i**: Let's assume the initial value of `i` is `x`.
2. **After Increment**: The value of `i` becomes `x + 1`.
3. **mak**: 
   - If the input string is `'<'`, `mak` will be `x + 1` (the new value of `i`).
   - Otherwise, `mak` will be `0`.

### Output Based on Conditions:
- **If the input string is `'<'`**:
  - `mak` will be `x + 1`.
  - The print statement will output: `? x+1 x+1 x+1 x+1`.
- **If the input string is not `'<'`**:
  - `mak` will be `0`.
  - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 x+1 x+1`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact input string is not provided, we need to consider both scenarios.

**Output if input string is `'<'`**:
Output: **? [x+1] [x+1] [x+1] [x+1] (where x is the initial value of i)**

**Output if input string is not `'<'`**:
Output: **? 0 0 [x+1] [x+1] (where x is the initial value of i)**

Given the task requires a single output and the input string is not specified, we can provide a generic answer based on the conditions.

Final Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where mak is i+1 if the input string is '<', otherwise 0, and i is the initial value of i incremented by 1)**

Since we don't have the exact initial value of `i` or the input string, the most precise description is:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where mak is i+1 if the input string is '<', otherwise 0, and i is the initial value of i incremented by 1)**
