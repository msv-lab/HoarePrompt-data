The code snippet provided is `mak = i`. This line assigns the value of the variable `i` to the variable `mak`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `i`, we can only state that `mak` will now hold whatever value `i` held before this assignment.

The initial state mentions that `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed and `s` is the string input by the user and is equal to '<'. These conditions remain unchanged by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, `s` is the string input by the user and `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is equal to `i`.**
