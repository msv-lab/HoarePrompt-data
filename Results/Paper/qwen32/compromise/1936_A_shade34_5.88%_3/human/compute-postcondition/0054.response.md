The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it iterates over, which is `len(pans)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `pans` has at least two elements for the loop to execute, because the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop starts from `1` and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`. This means `len(pans)` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to `1` at the start of the loop.
3. The current state of `mak` and `mak2` does not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.
4. `pans` must be a list with at least two elements for the loop to execute.

State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was '=' and must have at least 2 elements, `n` remains unchanged**
