The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Therefore, the value of `mak` will now be equal to the value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and the previous value of `mak`) remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 after the assignment, but since the increment operation is described as happening after the assignment in the initial state, we will reflect that in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the value of `i` after the assignment, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
