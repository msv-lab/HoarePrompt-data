To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `mak` is set to `i` if the current input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received.
- `pans` contains at least two elements.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `i` is 2.

### Variable Values:
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `mak` is not explicitly defined in the state, but we know it could either be 0 or `i` (which is 2) depending on the input. Since there's no information about the input being '>', we assume `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is not relevant to this print statement as it is not used in the print statement.
- `pans` is a list with at least two elements, but we don't know the exact elements. We will denote the elements as `pans[0]`, `pans[1]`, `pans[2]`, etc.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```
Substituting the known values:
- `mak` is 0.
- `i` is 2.

So, the print statement becomes:
```python
print('?', pans[0], pans[0], pans[2], pans[2])
```

### Output:
The print statement will output a question mark followed by the element at index 0 of the `pans` list twice, and the element at index 2 of the `pans` list twice.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and pans[2] is the third element of the pans list)**
