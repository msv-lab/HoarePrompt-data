Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `mak` is initialized to 0.
- The variable `i` is not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown based on the given information.

Since the value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine an explicit value for it. Therefore, we will represent it as it is in the output.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Based on the given information:
- `mak` is 0.
- `i` is unknown.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is an unknown integer)**
