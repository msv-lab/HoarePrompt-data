The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` will generate at least one value (1) only if `n` is greater than 1. The variables `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `s` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` do not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was '=', `n` must be greater than 1**
