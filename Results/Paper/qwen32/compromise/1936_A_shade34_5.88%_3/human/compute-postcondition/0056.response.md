The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values; it simply flushes the output buffer. Therefore, the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was '=' and must have at least 2 elements, `n` remains unchanged**.
