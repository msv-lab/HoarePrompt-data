Postcondition: **`mak` is 5 if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` retains its previous value which is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `mak2` retains its previous value which is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `pans` is `[5]` if `s` is `'<'`, or retains its previous value which includes `4` if the previous `s` was `'<'`, the value `i` if the previous `s` was `'='`, or an empty list if the previous `s` was neither `'<'` nor `'='`. If the previous `s` was `'='` and the current `s` is not `'<'`, `pans` now includes the value `5`. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is the new string input provided by the user. `i` is 5.**
