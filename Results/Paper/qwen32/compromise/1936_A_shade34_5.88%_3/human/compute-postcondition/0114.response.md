Output State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` is `[i]` if the previous `pans` was not empty and `s` is equal to '<', `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The list `pans` now includes the current value of `i`. All other variables retain their previous states, including `mak`, `mak2`, `n`, `s`, and the incremented value of `i`.
