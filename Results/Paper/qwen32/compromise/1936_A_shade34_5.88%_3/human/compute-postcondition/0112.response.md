The code snippet `mak = i` updates the value of `mak` to the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` is an empty list if `s` is not equal to '<', `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
