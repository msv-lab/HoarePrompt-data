Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly. It interacts with an external system by asking queries in the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in a hidden permutation sequence. The function's goal is to determine and return indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized, using at most 3n queries per test case.**
