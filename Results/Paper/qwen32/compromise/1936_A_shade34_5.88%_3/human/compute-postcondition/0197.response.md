Postcondition: ***`mak` is 4 if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `pans` is a list containing the value 4 if `s` is `'<'`, the value `i` if `s` is `'='`, or an empty list if `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`. If `s` is `'='`, `pans` now includes the value 5; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the new string input provided by the user; `i` is 5.***
