In the provided for loop, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be directly adjusted to ensure the loop executes. They are mentioned as part of the initial state but do not influence the execution of the loop itself.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value of `n`.

State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0**
