The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than 0. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. The variables `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `s` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Given that `i` was the loop variable in the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`mak` is `i` if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is the string input provided by the user. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.** 

To be more specific, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`mak` is `i` if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is the string input provided by the user. `i` is 4.** 

(Note: Replace `4` with the actual incremented value of `i` from the previous iteration.)

State: **`mak` is `i` if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is the string input provided by the user. `i` is incremented by 1.** 

If we assume `i` was 3, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`mak` is `i` if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is the string input provided by the user. `i` is 4.**
