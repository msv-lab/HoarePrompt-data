The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is an input integer.**
