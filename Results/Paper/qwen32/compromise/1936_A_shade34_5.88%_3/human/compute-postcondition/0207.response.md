The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range of the loop, which is defined by `len(pans)`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. According to the loop, `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been some value, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, provided that `i` is still less than `len(pans)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `mak` is `i` if the current input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received.
- `pans` contains at least two elements.
- `n` remains unchanged.

We need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received, `pans` contains at least two elements, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 1 at the end of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `i` should be 2. Therefore, we can generalize this as:

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received, `pans` contains at least two elements, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received, `pans` contains at least two elements, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, to be more precise in terms of the next value of `i`:

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received, `pans` contains at least two elements, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Then:

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received, `pans` contains at least two elements, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `k + 1`**.

Since we don't know `k`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received, `pans` contains at least two elements, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received, `pans` contains at least two elements, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**.
