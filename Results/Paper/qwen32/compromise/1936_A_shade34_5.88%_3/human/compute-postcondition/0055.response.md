To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was '=' and must have at least 2 elements.
- `n` remains unchanged (though `n` is not used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis
1. **`mak` and `mak2` Values:**
   - Both `mak` and `mak2` are explicitly set to 0.
   - In the print statement, `mak` is used as an index to access elements in the `pans` list.

2. **`pans` List:**
   - `pans` is a list of indices where the character '=' appears in some string `s`.
   - It is stated that `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
   - Therefore, `pans[0]` and `pans[1]` (and potentially more) are defined.

3. **`i` Variable:**
   - The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state.
   - Since `i` is used as an index to access elements in the `pans` list, we must assume `i` is a valid index for `pans`.
   - However, since `i` is not explicitly defined or given a value in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific value for `pans[i]` without additional information.
   - Given the problem's constraints, we can assume `i` is a valid index (e.g., `i` could be 0, 1, or any other valid index in the `pans` list).

### Output Explanation
- The print statement will output a '?' followed by four elements from the `pans` list.
- The first two elements are `pans[mak]` and `pans[mak]`, which are both `pans[0]` since `mak` is 0.
- The next two elements are `pans[i]` and `pans[i]`, which are both `pans[i]`.

Given that `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`. The value of `pans[i]` depends on the specific value of `i`, but we know it is an element of the `pans` list.

### Conclusion
The output will be:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and pans[i] is the i-th element of the pans list)**
