To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the given outputs after the first 3 iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 (not affected by the loop).
   - `n` is the number of iterations.
   - `mak` is the largest value of `i` (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `pans` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Body:**
   - For each `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.
     - The user is prompted for input, which is stored in `s`.
     - If `s` is `'<'`, then `mak` is updated to `i` and `pans` is reset to `[i]`.
     - If `s` is `'='`, then `i` is appended to `pans`.

### Observations from Given Outputs:
- **After 1 iteration:**
  - `mak` is updated to `i` if `s` is `'<'`.
  - `pans` is updated to `[i]` if `s` is `'<'` or appended with `i` if `s` is `'='`.
  
- **After 2 iterations:**
  - If `s` was `'<'` in the first iteration, `mak` is updated to `i` (which was 0 in the first iteration).
  - If `s` was `'='` in the first iteration, `mak` remains unchanged.
  - `pans` is updated based on the value of `s` in the first iteration.
  - `i` is 1 in the second iteration.

- **After 3 iterations:**
  - `mak` is updated to `i` if `s` is `'<'` in the third iteration.
  - `pans` is updated based on the value of `s` in the third iteration.
  - `i` is 2 in the third iteration.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will continue to iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
- `mak` will be the largest index `i` where `s` was `'<'`.
- `mak2` will remain the same as `mak` unless explicitly changed (which it is not in the given loop).
- `pans` will be a list of all indices `i` where `s` was `'='`.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations, `mak` will hold the largest index where the input was `'<'`, and `pans` will contain all indices where the input was `'='`.

Output State: **mak is the largest index i where s was '<', mak2 is the same as mak, pans is a list of all indices where s was '=', and n remains unchanged.**
