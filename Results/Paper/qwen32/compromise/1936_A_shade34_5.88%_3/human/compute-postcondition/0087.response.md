The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` to the next value. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is `<`, otherwise `mak` remains 0; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was `=`; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`**
