Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **mak**: This is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'.
2. **mak2**: This remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'.
3. **pans**: This is updated to `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise it remains unchanged.
4. **n**: This is an integer greater than 0.
5. **s**: This is the new input string.
6. **i**: This is incremented by 1.

### Key Points:
- `mak` and `mak2` are essentially the same variable, as `mak2` remains the same as `mak`.
- `pans` is not used in the `print` statement, so we don't need to consider its value.
- The variable `i` is incremented before the `print` statement, so the value of `i` being printed is the new value after the increment.

### Analysis:
- Since `mak` and `mak2` are the same, the print statement will display the same value for `mak` and `mak2`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement, so the printed value of `i` will be the new incremented value.

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `mak` (which is the same as `mak2`), the incremented value of `i`, and `mak2` again.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [mak]** (where `[mak]` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', and `[i]` is the incremented value of `i`)
