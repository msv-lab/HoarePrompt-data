The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `mak` is `i + 1` if the input string is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains `i`
- `mak2` and `pans` remain their initial values
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `n` is greater than `i`

Since `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables, the output state will reflect the same conditions as the initial state.

Output State: **`mak` is `i + 1` if the input string is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains `i`; `mak2` and `pans` remain their initial values; `i` is `i + 2`; `n` is greater than `i`.**
