Given the initial state:
- `mak` is the last index `i` for which the input was `'>'`, or 0 if no `'>'` was ever input.
- `mak2` remains the initial value.
- `pans` remains the initial value.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('!', mak2, mak)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak` could be either 0 (if no `'>'` was ever input) or the last index `i` for which the input was `'>'`.
- `mak2` and `pans` are mentioned to remain the initial value, but their specific initial values are not provided.

Since the initial values of `mak2` and `pans` are not specified, we will describe the output in terms of `mak2` and `mak` directly.

Output: **! [mak2] [mak] (where mak2 is the initial value of mak2 and mak is the last index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no '>' was ever input)**
