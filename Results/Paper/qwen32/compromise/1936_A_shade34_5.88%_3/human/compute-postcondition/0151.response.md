Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` remains the initial value (its value is not specified, so we'll treat it as an unknown).
- `pans` remains the initial value (its value is not specified, so we'll treat it as an unknown).
- `n` must be greater than 1 (its exact value is not specified, but we know it's greater than 1).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The first argument to the `print` function is the string `'?'`.
- The second and third arguments are both `mak`, which is explicitly given as `0`.
- The fourth and fifth arguments are both `i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined, it will cause a `NameError` when the code is executed. But based on the task instructions, we should describe the output as precisely as possible given the information.

Given that `i` is not defined, the precise description of the output would indicate that there is an error. However, since the task asks for what will be printed, and we are to assume the code runs without errors based on the given information, we will describe the output as if `i` were defined, even though it is not.

### Output Description:
- The first item printed is the string `'?'`.
- The second and third items printed are both the value of `mak`, which is `0`.
- The fourth and fifth items printed are both `i`, which is an undefined variable. Since we are to provide the most precise description possible, we'll assume `i` is defined and will print whatever its value is, but since it's not defined, we'll describe it as `i`.

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is an undefined variable)**

However, since the variable `i` is not defined, the actual execution of this code would result in an error. But adhering strictly to the task instructions, we provide:

Output: **? 0 0 i i**
