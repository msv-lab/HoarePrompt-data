Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `mak` is 0.
2. `mak2` remains the initial value (not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
3. `pans` contains at least 2 elements.

### Code to be Executed:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. `mak` is 0, so `pans[mak]` will refer to the element at index 0 of the `pans` list.
2. The print statement includes `pans[mak]` twice, so the element at index 0 of `pans` will be printed twice.
3. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined, this code will raise a `NameError` because `pans[i]` cannot be evaluated without knowing the value of `i`.

### Output:
Since the variable `i` is not defined, the code will not execute successfully, and a `NameError` will be raised. However, based on the provided format and the assumption that the task is to describe the output as precisely as possible based on the given information, we will describe the intended output if `i` were defined.

Given that `i` is not defined, the precise output cannot be determined without additional information. However, if we hypothetically assume `i` were defined and provided, the output would look like this:

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where [pans[0]] is the first element of the pans list and [pans[i]] is the element at index i of the pans list)**

Since `i` is not defined, the actual output will be a `NameError`. For the sake of adhering to the task format, we will describe the output as if `i` were defined.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where [pans[0]] is the first element of the pans list and [pans[i]] is the element at index i of the pans list)**

However, the actual execution will result in:
Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**
