Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'.
- `mak2` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'. (Note: This seems to be a repetition; `mak2` should likely be defined differently or it might be a typo. For the purpose of this task, we'll assume `mak2` is intended to be a different variable or it's a mistake and should be `mak` again.)
- `pans` is an empty list.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.
- `mak` and `mak2` are described as the maximum value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`. Since the exact value of `i` or the input sequence is not provided, we can only describe `mak` and `mak2` in terms of this condition.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. We can only describe it as `i`.

### Output Description:
- The output will be `'?'` followed by the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2` (which is the same as `mak` based on the given information), the value of `i`, and the value of `mak2` again.

Therefore, the output can be described as:
Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where mak is the maximum value of i for which the input was '<', mak2 is the same as mak, and i is an undefined variable)**

However, to adhere strictly to the format and given the repetition of `mak2`:
Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where mak and mak2 are the maximum value of i for which the input was '<', and i is an undefined variable)**
