The code snippet calculates the value of `p2` based on the coordinates provided in the `coord` list. The variables `n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `p1` remain unchanged. The new value of `p2` is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences in the x and y coordinates of the last two points in the `coord` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `coord` is a sorted list of tuples `[(a1, b1), (a2, b2), (a3, b3), (a4, b4)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 4, `x` and `y` are the two integers from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`**
