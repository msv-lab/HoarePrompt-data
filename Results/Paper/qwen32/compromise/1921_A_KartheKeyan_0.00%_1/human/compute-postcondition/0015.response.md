The code snippet sorts the list `coord` in ascending order based on the tuples it contains. The sorting is done lexicographically, meaning it first compares `x` values, and if they are the same, it compares `y` values.

Given that `coord` is `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, after sorting, `coord` will be ordered such that the tuple with the smallest `x` value comes first. If two tuples have the same `x` value, the one with the smaller `y` value will come first.

The other variables (`n`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input.**

In natural language: The list `coord` is now sorted in ascending order, while `n`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y` retain their original values.
