The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of `n`, `coord`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input.**
