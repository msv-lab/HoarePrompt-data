The only variables in the loop head are `i`, which is the iteration variable, and the range limit, which is `4` in this case. Therefore, only the variable `i` needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `0`. Since the loop iterates from `0` to `3` (inclusive), the next value for `i` should be `1` for the loop to execute one more time.

The other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, `x`, and `y`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is `[(x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input.**
