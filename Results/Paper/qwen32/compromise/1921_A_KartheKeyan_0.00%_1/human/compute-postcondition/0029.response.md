Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Explanation: The `coord` list now includes the new tuple `(x, y)` appended to it, making its length two. All other variables remain unchanged.
