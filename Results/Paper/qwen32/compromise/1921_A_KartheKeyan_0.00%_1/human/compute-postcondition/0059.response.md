To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the initial state.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: `n` is the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, the loop reads four pairs of integers, sorts them, computes the area of the square, and prints the result.
   - The variable `n` is decremented by 1 after each iteration.
3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.

### Given Output States for First 3 Iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `n` is `n - 1`, `coord` is the sorted list of coordinates, `res` is computed and printed, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read.
- After 2 iterations: `n` is `n - 2`, `coord` is the sorted list of coordinates, `res` is computed and printed, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read.
- After 3 iterations: `n` is `n - 3`, `coord` is the sorted list of coordinates, `res` is computed and printed, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read.

### Final Output State:
- After all iterations, `n` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
- The variables `coord`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y` will be in their state after the last iteration, but they are not relevant to the final state since the loop has terminated.

### Conclusion:
The final state of the loop when all iterations are completed is that `n` is 0. The other variables (`coord`, `res`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, `p2`) are not relevant to the final state of the loop head and body.

Output State: **n is 0.**
