Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `i` is 3, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` has been updated to the absolute value of the square root of `p1` multiplied by the square root of `p2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
