### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players after playing a series of chess games. The key points to consider are:

1. **Sum of Scores and Parity**: The total points scored by the three players (a, b, c) must be even because each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1). If the total sum is odd, it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules, and the program correctly outputs -1 in this case.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: 
   - The total number of games played is `(a + b + c) // 2` because each game contributes 2 to the total score.
   - The maximum number of draws is limited by the number of games involving the two players with the lowest scores (a and b). This is because any additional games beyond what a and b can participate in would necessarily involve the player with the highest score (c), and such games can't be all draws without affecting the scores of a and b disproportionately.
   - Therefore, `min((a + b + c) // 2, a + b)` gives the maximum number of draws possible.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If all scores are zero, no games were played, and the number of draws is zero.
   - If the scores are such that no valid game sequence can produce them (e.g., 1 1 1), the program correctly outputs -1.
   - The program handles all provided examples correctly, indicating that the logic is sound.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws and handles invalid score configurations by returning -1. Thus, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
