The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop will execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` can remain as they are since they are not part of the loop head and do not influence the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are each integers representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order**
