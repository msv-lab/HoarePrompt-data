Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-2` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is True, and `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `nums` is not sorted.**
