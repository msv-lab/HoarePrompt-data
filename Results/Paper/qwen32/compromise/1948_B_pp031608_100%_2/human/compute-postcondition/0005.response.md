To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i`, `m`, and the range parameters.

The given for loop is:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `i` starts at `m - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive).
- For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value (`m - 1`) must be greater than or equal to 1.
- This implies that `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

### Adjustments:
- `m` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop executes.
- `i` should be initialized to `m - 1`, but since we're adjusting the state before the loop starts, we don't need to explicitly set `i` because it will be automatically set by the `range` function.
- Other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is True**
