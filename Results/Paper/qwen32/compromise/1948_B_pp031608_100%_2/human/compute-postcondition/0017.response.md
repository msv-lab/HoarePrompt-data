The `break` statement in the given code snippet does not affect the values of any variables. It simply exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. Since there are no other operations modifying the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `nums`, `ans`, or `i` in the provided code snippet, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is modified if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is False, `i` is decreased by 1 if `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
