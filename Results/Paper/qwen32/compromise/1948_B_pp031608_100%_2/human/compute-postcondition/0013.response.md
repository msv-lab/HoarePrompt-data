Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input with `arr[i - 1]` set to `nums[0]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, and `ans` is either True or False. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged.**
