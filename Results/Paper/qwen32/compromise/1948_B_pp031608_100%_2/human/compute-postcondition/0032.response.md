The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `arr`. This means `arr` is now populated with the new values from the input, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is now `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is either True or False depending on whether any `nums` was unsorted.**
