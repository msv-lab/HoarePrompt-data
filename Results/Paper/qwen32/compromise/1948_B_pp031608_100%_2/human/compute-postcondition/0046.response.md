Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `n-2`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, `nums`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
