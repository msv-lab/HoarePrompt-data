To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i`, `m`, and the range parameters.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Parameters**:
   - The loop runs from `m - 1` down to `1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `m - 1` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

2. **Variable `m`**:
   - To ensure `m - 1 >= 1`, `m` must be at least `2`.

3. **Variable `i`**:
   - Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly defined in the given state, but it will take the value of `m - 1` during the first iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `m - 1` when the loop starts, ensuring that the loop condition is met.

### Adjustments:
- We need to ensure `m` is at least `2` to allow the loop to execute.
- The initial value of `i` is not directly adjustable since it is determined by the range function, but we need to ensure that `m - 1` is a valid starting point.

### Final State:
Given the constraints and the need for the loop to execute, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-2` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is True**

This ensures that the loop can execute at least once.
