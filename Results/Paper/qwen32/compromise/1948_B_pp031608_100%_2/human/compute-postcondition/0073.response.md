The given code snippet creates a new list `nums` which consists of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.

Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `arr[i - 1]` refers to `arr[1]` and `arr[i]` refers to `arr[2]`.

Let's denote `arr[1]` as `val1` and `arr[2]` as `val2`. The digits of `val1` are extracted and converted to integers, and then `val2` is appended to this list.

Therefore, `nums` becomes a list of the digits of `val1` followed by `val2`.

Since no other variables are modified in the given code snippet, the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-2` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` remains True unless set to False in a previous condition, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of the digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`.**
