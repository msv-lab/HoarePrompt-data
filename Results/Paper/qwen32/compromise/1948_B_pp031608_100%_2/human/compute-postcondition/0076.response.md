Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-2` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of the digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
