The given Python code snippet only initializes the variable `ans` to `True`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is True.**
