The code snippet provided modifies the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. This means that the element at index `i - 1` in the list `arr` is now set to the first element of the list `nums`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes its value is `arr[i - 1]`. All other variables retain their original values or conditions.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[i - 1]` now equal to `nums[0]`, `i` is `n-3`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
