The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `m`. This means that `m` will hold the integer value obtained from user input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer.**
