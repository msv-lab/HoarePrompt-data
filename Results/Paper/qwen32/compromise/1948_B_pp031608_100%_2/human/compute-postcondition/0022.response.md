To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
```

Here's what the code does:
- It takes the element at index `i - 1` from the list `arr`.
- Converts this element to a string.
- Iterates over each character in this string, converting each character back to an integer, and creates a list of these integers.
- Appends the element at index `i` from the list `arr` to this new list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
- `m` is at least 2.
- `i` is `i + 1` where `i` is the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration (and `1 <= i < m-1`).

The variable `arr` is not defined in the initial state, but based on the context, it seems `arr` should be `a`.

So, the updated `nums` list will be:
- The digits of `a[i - 1]` converted to integers.
- Followed by the integer `a[i]`.

Let's assume `arr` is `a` for the sake of this example.

### Example Calculation:
If `a` is `[12, 34, 56]` and `i` is `2`:
- `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]` which is `34`.
- Converting `34` to a string and then to a list of integers gives `[3, 4]`.
- `a[i]` is `a[2]` which is `56`.
- Combining these results in `nums = [3, 4, 56]`.

### General Case:
For any `a` and `i`, `nums` will be the list of digits of `a[i - 1]` followed by `a[i]`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `i` is `i + 1` where `i` is the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration (and `1 <= i < m-1`), `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `a[i - 1]` followed by `a[i]`.**
