Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Program Analysis

The task is to determine if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits and inserting them back into the array at the same position.

Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Sorting**:
   - The program checks if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and then attempts to split `arr[i - 1]` and check if the resulting list is sorted.
   - However, the logic does not correctly handle the transformation of the array. It only checks if the immediate neighbors can be sorted after splitting, but it doesn't account for the possibility of further splits needed to achieve a fully sorted array.

2. **Incomplete Handling of Splits**:
   - The program only performs a single split and checks the immediate effect. It does not recursively or iteratively ensure that the entire array can be sorted through multiple splits.
   - For example, consider an array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. After splitting `12`, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`. However, the program does not check if further splits are needed to sort the array completely.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split and rearranged to achieve a sorted array.
   - For instance, an array like `[32, 10, 1]` would require splitting `32` into `[3, 2]` and then rearranging to `[1, 2, 3, 0, 1]`, which can be sorted.

### Counterexample

Consider the following input:
```
1
3
32 10 1
```

- The program will check if `1 < 10` (which is true), then split `10` into `[1, 0]` and check if `[1, 0, 1]` is sorted. Since it is not, the program will incorrectly output `NO`.
- However, the correct transformation would be to split `32` into `[3, 2]`, resulting in `[3, 2, 10, 1]`, which can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 3, 10]` and thus sorted.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted through the described operations. It fails to handle multiple splits and rearrangements necessary to achieve a fully sorted array.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The program incorrectly assumes that a single split and immediate neighbor check is sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted. It does not account for the need for multiple splits and rearrangements to achieve a fully sorted array, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
