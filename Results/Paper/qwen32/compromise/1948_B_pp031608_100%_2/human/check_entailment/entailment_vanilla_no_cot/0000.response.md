Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program attempts to check if the array can be sorted by splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10, but it does so in a way that doesn't guarantee the entire array can be made non-decreasing through the allowed operations.

Here's a more detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. The program iterates from the end of the array towards the beginning.
2. When it finds an element that is smaller than the previous one, it splits the previous element and checks if the resulting list (including the current element) is sorted.
3. If the resulting list is not sorted, it immediately concludes that it's not possible to sort the array and breaks out of the loop.
4. However, this approach does not account for the possibility that further splits might allow the array to become sorted.

A correct solution would involve attempting to split elements and checking if the entire array can be made non-decreasing through these operations. This typically requires a more complex approach, possibly involving backtracking or dynamic programming, to explore all possible ways of splitting the elements and checking if a sorted configuration can be achieved.

Here's a corrected version of the program that uses a more appropriate approach:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    stack = []
    for num in arr:
        while stack and stack[-1] > num:
            last = stack.pop()
            digits = [int(d) for d in str(last)]
            if len(digits) == 1 or digits[-1] <= num:
                stack.extend(digits)
                break
            else:
                return False
        else:
            stack.append(num)
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        print('YES' if can_be_sorted(arr) else 'NO')

func()
```

This corrected version uses a stack to simulate the process of splitting elements and checks if the array can be made non-decreasing. It ensures that all possible splits are considered and correctly determines if sorting is possible.
