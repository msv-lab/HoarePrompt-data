You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: The final output state consists of `n` lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO', corresponding to the result of each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if we can sort an array by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits and inserting those digits back into the array in the same position. The goal is to check if it's possible to transform the array into a non-decreasing sequence using this operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve this problem with the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
3. It initializes `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted.
4. It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning.
5. If it finds an element that is smaller than the previous one (`arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`), it checks if splitting the previous element (`arr[i - 1]`) and inserting its digits followed by the current element (`arr[i]`) results in a sorted sequence.
6. If the resulting sequence is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
7. It prints "YES" if `ans` is `True` and "NO" otherwise.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Checking**: The program only checks if the immediate neighbor elements can be sorted after splitting the larger element. This is not sufficient because the operation can be applied multiple times and to different elements. The program does not account for the possibility of needing to split multiple elements or rearrange them in more complex ways to achieve a sorted array.
2. **Handling of Multiple Splits**: The program only considers the immediate effect of splitting a single element. It does not simulate the process of potentially splitting multiple elements and checking the entire array again.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program might fail for certain edge cases where multiple splits are needed to achieve a sorted array, but the program only checks a limited condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to consider the full complexity of the problem, particularly the need to potentially split multiple elements and recheck the entire array.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
