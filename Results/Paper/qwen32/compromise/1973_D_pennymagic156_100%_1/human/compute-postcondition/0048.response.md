To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

```
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue as long as both `cnt` is truthy (non-zero) and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnt` is `cnt - 1`
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`
- `n` must be greater than 0

Let's analyze each part:

1. **Condition `cnt`:**
   - The state says `cnt` is `cnt - 1`. This means that `cnt` has just been decremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - For the loop to continue, `cnt` must still be truthy (non-zero). Therefore, `cnt` should be at least 1 before decrementing it. After decrementing, `cnt` should remain non-zero.

2. **Condition `l < n + 1`:**
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. Since we don't know what `func_2()` returns, we need to ensure that whatever `func_2()` returns, adding 1 to it results in a value that is less than `n + 1`.
   - To guarantee this, we need to make sure that `n` is large enough such that `l` (which is `func_2() + 1`) is always less than `n + 1`. The simplest way to ensure this is to set `n` to a value that is greater than the maximum possible value of `func_2() + 1`.

Since we don't have specific information about `func_2()`, let's assume that `func_2()` can return any non-negative integer. To be safe, we can set `n` to a sufficiently large value, but the minimal adjustment would be to ensure that `n` is at least 2 more than the current `l` to guarantee `l < n + 1`.

However, since we need to adhere strictly to the given state and only adjust variables in the loop head (`cnt` and `n`), we can adjust `n` to be greater than the current `l` (which is `func_2() + 1`). Given that we don't know the exact value of `func_2()`, we can assume that `n` should be at least 2 to ensure `l < n + 1` holds true.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `cnt` must be at least 1 before decrementing it.
- `n` must be greater than the current `l` (which is `func_2() + 1`). Assuming `func_2()` can return 0, the smallest `n` should be 2.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `func_2()`, we can generalize and say `n` must be greater than the current `l`.

State: **`cnt` must be at least 1, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `l`**
