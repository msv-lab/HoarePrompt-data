To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head:

```
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `cnt` is non-zero.
2. `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnt` is non-zero (specifically, `cnt` is `initial cnt - 1`).
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- `i` is 1.

Let's analyze each condition:

1. **Condition `cnt`:**
   - The state specifies that `cnt` is non-zero, specifically `initial cnt - 1`. This means that `cnt` is still positive, and thus this condition is satisfied. No adjustment is needed for `cnt` to keep the loop running.

2. **Condition `l < n + 1`:**
   - The state specifies that `l` is `func_2() + 1`. To ensure that `l < n + 1` holds true, we need to make sure that `func_2() + 1` is less than `n + 1`.
   - Since we don't have specific information about the value returned by `func_2()`, we can only express the condition in terms of `n` and the result of `func_2()`.

Given these considerations, the only state that might need adjustment is `n`, ensuring that `l < n + 1` remains true. Since `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `n` must be such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2() < n`.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than the result of `func_2()`.

State: **`cnt` is non-zero (specifically, `initial cnt - 1`), `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than `func_2()`**
