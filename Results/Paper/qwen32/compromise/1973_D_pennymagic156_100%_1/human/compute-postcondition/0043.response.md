The code assigns the value of `k` to `cnt` and the value `1` to `l`. The initial state mentioned that `cnt` was `0` and `l` was the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration plus `1`. The conditions `cnt` is not `0` or `l` is not equal to `n + 1` and `i` being incremented by `1` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code snippet.

Since `cnt` is now assigned the value of `k`, the condition `cnt` is not `0` will depend on the value of `k`. Similarly, `l` is set to `1`, which means the condition `l` is not equal to `n + 1` will depend on whether `n + 1` equals `1`.

Output State: **`cnt` is `k`, `l` is `1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and either `cnt` is not `0` or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**.
