To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `cnt` is `0`
- `l` is `n + 1`
- `i` is `1`

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
- Inside the f-string, `i * v` is evaluated.
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is `1`.
- However, the variable `v` is not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
Given that `i` is `1`, the expression `i * v` simplifies to `1 * v`, which is just `v`. Since the value of `v` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i * v`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **! [v] (where v is the value of the variable v)**
