The code reassigns the variable `l` to the value of `func_2() + 1`. Since the initial state specifies that `l` was originally `func_2() + 1`, the value of `l` remains unchanged after the code execution. The values of `cnt` and `n` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`cnt` is at least 1 (originally greater than 1), `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `n` is greater than `l`.**
