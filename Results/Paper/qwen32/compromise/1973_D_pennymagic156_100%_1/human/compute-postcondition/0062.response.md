To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the implicit range defined by `n` and `k`.

Given:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n // k + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is `0`, `l` is the value of `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration before the loop terminates, and either `cnt` is not `0` or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

Since `cnt` and `l` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. We need to ensure that `i` is set correctly for the next iteration.

Let's break it down:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value that caused the loop to terminate. Since the loop runs from `1` to `n // k`, the loop terminates when `i` reaches `n // k + 1`.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value (which is `n // k` at the point of termination) to `n // k + 1`. However, since the loop has just terminated, we need to reset `i` to the value it should have at the start of the next iteration if the loop were to continue. This means `i` should be set to `1` (the starting value of the loop).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the initial condition of the loop.

State: **`cnt` is `0`, `l` is the value of `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration before the loop terminates, and either `cnt` is not `0` or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `i` is `1`**.
