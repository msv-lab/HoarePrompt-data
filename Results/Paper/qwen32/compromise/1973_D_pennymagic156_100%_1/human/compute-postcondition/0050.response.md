The code reassigns the value of `l` to `func_2() + 1`. Since the initial state specifies that `l` is already `func_2() + 1`, the value of `l` remains unchanged after the execution of the code snippet. The values of `cnt` and `n` remain as per their initial conditions.

Output State: **`cnt` must be at least 1, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `l`.**
