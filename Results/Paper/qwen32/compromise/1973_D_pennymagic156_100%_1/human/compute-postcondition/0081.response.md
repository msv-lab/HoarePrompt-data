Postcondition: **`cnt` is `0` if `k` iterations occur, otherwise `cnt` is `k - m` where `m` is the number of iterations before `l` reaches `n + 1`. `l` is `n + 1` if the loop terminates due to `l` reaching `n + 1`, otherwise `l` is the value of `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration. `i` is `1`. It is not the case that both `cnt` is `0` and `l` is `n + 1`.**
