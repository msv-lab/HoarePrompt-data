To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `cnt` is initialized to 0.
- `l` is described as the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration plus 1, and it also equals `n + 1`. This means `l` is dependent on the return value of `func_2()` from a previous iteration and `n`.
- The print statement is `print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)`, which indicates that the output will be a formatted string starting with an exclamation mark followed by the product of `i` and `v`.

However, the initial state does not provide explicit values for `i` and `v`. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables**: The variables `i` and `v` are used in the print statement.
2. **Determine Their Values**: Since their values are not explicitly provided in the initial state, we can only refer to them as they are.
3. **Formulate the Output**: The output will be `!` followed by the product of `i` and `v`.

Given this analysis, the output will be:

Output: **! [i * v] (where i and v are variables whose values are not specified in the initial state)**
