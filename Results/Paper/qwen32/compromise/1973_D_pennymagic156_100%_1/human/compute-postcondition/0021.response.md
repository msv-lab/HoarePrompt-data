To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it terminates.

The loop runs from `i = n` down to `i = 1`, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration. In each iteration, the following steps occur:
1. It prints a query string `? 1 {i * n}`.
2. It assigns the result of `func_2()` to `v`.
3. If `v` equals `n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.

If `v` never equals `n` during any of these iterations, the loop will run until `i` reaches 1. Therefore, the final state depends on whether `v` ever equals `n` during the loop iterations.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **Scenario where `v` equals `n` at some point**:
   - The loop breaks as soon as `v` equals `n`.
   - At this point, `v` is set to the current value of `i`.
   - The final `i` value is the one at which `v` became `n`.

2. **Scenario where `v` never equals `n`**:
   - The loop runs all the way down to `i = 1`.
   - Since `v` never equals `n`, `v` retains its last assigned value from `func_2()`.
   - The final `i` value is `1`.

### Final Output State:
- If `v` equals `n` at some point during the loop, `v` will be set to that `i` value, and the loop will terminate early.
- If `v` never equals `n`, the loop will terminate when `i` reaches `1`, and `v` will retain its last value from `func_2()`.

Given the constraints and the behavior of the loop, the final state can be described as follows:

- `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were initially set by `func_3()`.
- `i` will be either the value at which `v` became `n` (if it did), or `1` (if `v` never became `n`).
- `v` will be either the value of `i` at which `v` became `n` (if it did), or the last value returned by `func_2()` (if `v` never became `n`).

Since we don't have specific information about the behavior of `func_2()`, we can only describe the general possible outcomes. However, based on the given scenarios, the most definitive final state without additional information about `func_2()` is when the loop completes all iterations:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `i` is `1`, and `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration.**

In natural language: After all iterations, `n` and `k` remain the same as initially set by `func_3()`. The variable `i` will be `1` because the loop decrements `i` down to `1` if `v` never equals `n`. The variable `v` will hold the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration of the loop.
