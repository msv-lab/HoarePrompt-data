The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. The values of `l` and `i` remain unchanged. Since `cnt` was initially non-zero, after decrementing, it remains non-zero unless it was exactly 1 before the operation, in which case it would become zero. However, the precondition states that `cnt` must be non-zero, so we assume it remains non-zero.

Output State: **`cnt` is non-zero (specifically, `cnt` is `initial cnt - 1`), `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is 1**.
