To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

- **Initial State:**
  - `cnt` must be non-zero (though it is not used in the print statement, it's part of the context).
  - `l` is 1.
  - `i` is 1.
  
- **Print Statement:**
  ```python
  print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
  ```

From the initial state, we know the explicit values of `l` and `i`:
- `l` is 1.
- `i` is 1.

However, the variable `v` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i * v`. We can only express the output in terms of `v`.

Given this information, the print statement will output:
- A literal question mark (`?`).
- The value of `l`, which is 1.
- The result of `i * v`, where `v` is an unknown variable.

Thus, the output will be in the form:
Output: **? 1 [i * v] (where v is an unknown variable)**

However, since `i` is explicitly 1, we can simplify the expression `i * v` to just `v`:

Output: **? 1 v (where v is an unknown variable)**
