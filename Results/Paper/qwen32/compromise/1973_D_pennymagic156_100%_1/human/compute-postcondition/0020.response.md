Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `i` is \(n - 2\); `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`. If `v` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to `n`, `k`, `i`, or `v`.**
