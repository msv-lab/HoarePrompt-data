The code snippet updates the value of `l` by setting it to the result of `func_2() + 1`. This means the previous value of `l` (which was `v + 1`) is replaced by the new value.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k` and `n` is at least 0, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` + 1.**
