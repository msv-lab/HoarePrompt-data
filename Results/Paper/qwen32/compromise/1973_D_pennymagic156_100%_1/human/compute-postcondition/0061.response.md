Postcondition: **`cnt` is `0`, `l` is the value of `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration before the loop terminates, and either `cnt` is not `0` or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.** 

Since the program does not enter the if block, the condition `(cnt == 0 and l == n + 1)` is false. Therefore, either `cnt` is not `0` or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`. However, we know from the precondition that `cnt` is `0`, so the negation must come from `l` not being equal to `n + 1`.
