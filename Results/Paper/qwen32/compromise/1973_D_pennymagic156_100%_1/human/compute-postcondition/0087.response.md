Functionality: **The function `func_5` takes no direct input parameters but retrieves two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4) from another function `func_3`. It then performs a series of operations involving printing queries and receiving responses through `func_2`. Based on these interactions, it either prints a specific value followed by calling `func_2` and returning `None`, or it prints '! -1' followed by calling `func_2` and returning `None`. The function does not modify its input parameters and does not return any meaningful value.**
