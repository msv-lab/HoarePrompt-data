The code snippet `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` to be the value returned by `func_2()` plus 1. Given the initial conditions, all other variables remain unchanged except for `l`.

Since `l` was initially defined as `func_2() + 1`, executing this line again would mean `l` is reassigned to the new value returned by `func_2()` plus 1. However, since the problem does not specify that `func_2()` returns a different value each time, we assume it returns the same value as before unless specified otherwise.

Thus, the new value of `l` is `func_2() + 1`, which is the same expression as its initial definition. Therefore, the state of `l` effectively remains the same in terms of the expression defining it, but conceptually, it is recalculated.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k` and `n` is at least 0, `k` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` + 1 and `l` must be less than `n + 1`.**
