Given that `to_int` is `False`, the value of `space` determines how `items` is constructed from `line`. If `space` is `True`, `items` would be a list of substrings from `line` split by spaces. However, since `space` is not explicitly stated to be `True` in the initial state, we must consider both possibilities.

Since `to_int` is `False`, we do not convert any elements to integers. Therefore, the output will either be a list of substrings (if `space` is `True`) or a list of characters (if `space` is `False`).

Output State: **The program returns `items`, which is a list of substrings from `line` split by spaces if `space` is `True`, or a list of characters from `line` if `space` is `False`.**
