You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        rep = 0

            if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
                number = Min
                k = k - Max
            else:
                number = Max
                k = k - Min
            tab.append(str(number))
            n -= Min * Max
            rep += 1
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(tab))
            for i in tab:
                print(i, end=' ')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it attempts to reduce `k` to zero by repeatedly subtracting the product of two derived values from `n`. If `k` is reduced to zero, it outputs 'YES', the number of steps taken, and the sequence of values used in the reduction. If `k` cannot be reduced to zero, it outputs 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and potential scenarios described in the problem statement. Let’s analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum and Maximum Prices**:
   - The program calculates `Min` and `Max` incorrectly and uses them in a way that does not guarantee the correct number of jewels will be bought by Alice. The logic to determine `Min` and `Max` and their usage to update `k` and `n` is flawed.
   - Specifically, `Min` and `Max` are calculated as:
     ```python
     (Min, Max) = (min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k))
     ```
     This calculation does not ensure that the prices set will lead to Alice buying exactly `k` jewels. The program then uses these values to update `k` and `n`, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Logic to Determine Prices**:
   - The logic to determine the prices `number` and to update `k` and `n` is flawed. The program tries to balance between `Min` and `Max` but does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought by Alice will be exactly `k`.
   - For example, the program might set prices that do not allow Alice to buy the exact number of jewels required (`k`). This could be due to incorrect calculations of how many jewels Alice can buy at each stall.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` is very large and `k` is small, or vice versa. The logic might fail to produce a valid set of prices that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - For example, consider the case where `n` is a very large number and `k` is 1. The program might set prices that do not allow Alice to buy exactly 1 jewel.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the prices in a single line separated by spaces, but the problem statement does not specify the format of the output prices. However, the logic to determine the prices is flawed, so the output format is irrelevant if the prices are incorrect.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider a specific test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
1000000000000000000 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
1
1000000000000000000
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might not produce the correct output because of the flawed logic to determine the prices.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all potential cases, and hence, the correctness is **False**.
