To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the behavior of the loop.

### Analysis of the Loop:

1. **Loop Head**: `for _ in range(t):`
   - This loop will run `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

2. **Loop Body**:
   - `n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())`: Reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - Initializes `rep = 0`, `number = 0`, and `tab = []`.
   - The `while` loop condition: `n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k`
     - The loop continues as long as `n` is not zero, `k` is positive, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Inside the `while` loop:
     - Calculates `Min` and `Max` based on `n // k` and `k`.
     - Updates `number` and `k` based on certain conditions.
     - Appends `str(number)` to `tab`.
     - Decreases `n` by `Min * Max` and increments `rep`.
   - After the `while` loop:
     - If `k == 0`, it prints 'YES', the length of `tab`, and the elements of `tab`.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Output State After All Iterations:

Given the initial state and the outputs after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

- **Initial State**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- **After 1 iteration**: `t` is decremented by 1, and the loop body is executed once. The state of `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number` is determined by the input values.
- **After 2 iterations**: `t` is decremented by 1 again, and the loop body is executed once more. The state of `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number` is updated based on the new input values.
- **After 3 iterations**: `t` is decremented by 1, and the loop body is executed a third time. The state of `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number` is updated based on the new input values.

### Final Output State:

After all `t` iterations have finished:
- `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration.
- The final state of `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number` will depend on the input values provided for each iteration.

### Conclusion:

The final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **t is 0; n, k, rep, tab, and number are determined by the input values for each iteration. If k is 0 for any iteration, it prints 'YES', the length of tab, and the elements of tab; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the loop will have processed all input values, printing 'YES' and the corresponding tab contents for each iteration where `k` becomes 0, or 'NO' otherwise.
