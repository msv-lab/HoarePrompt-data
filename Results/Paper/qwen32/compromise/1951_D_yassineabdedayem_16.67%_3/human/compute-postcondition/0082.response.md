Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `rep` is 2, `tab` is either `['1', '1']` or `['3', '2']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is `n`, `k` is `1 - n`, `number` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`, which means `k` becomes `1 - n`. All other variables retain their initial values.
