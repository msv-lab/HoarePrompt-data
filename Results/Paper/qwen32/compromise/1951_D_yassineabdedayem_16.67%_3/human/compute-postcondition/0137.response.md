The code snippet `tab.append(str(number))` appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. The values of `t`, `rep`, `tab`, `Max`, `Min`, `n`, `number`, and `k` remain unchanged except for `tab`.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `rep` is `2`, `tab` is `['number', str(number), str(number)]`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `n` is `(k - Max) + 1`, `Min` is `min(((k - Max) + 1) // (k - Max), k - Max)`, and `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. Otherwise, `n` is `k`, `Min` is `1`, `Max` is `max(1, k - 1)`, `number` is `max(1, k - 1)`, and `k` is `k - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the list `tab` now includes an additional element which is the string representation of `number`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
