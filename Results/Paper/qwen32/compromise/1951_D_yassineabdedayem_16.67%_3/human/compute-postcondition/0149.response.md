To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state provided:

- `t` is `t` (this seems to be a placeholder and doesn't provide specific information about its value).
- `n` is 0 or less than `k`.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is the number of iterations (less than 60).
- `tab` is a list of string representations of numbers with at least two elements.
- `number` is the last number calculated.
- `i` is the next element in `tab` after the current `i`.

Given the condition `n` is 0 or less than `k`, and `k` is 0, `n` must be 0 (since `n` cannot be less than 0 if `k` is 0).

The variable `i` is described as the next element in `tab` after the current `i`, but since `i` is not explicitly defined before this statement, we assume `i` is initialized to the first element of `tab`. For the purpose of this explanation, let's denote the first element of `tab` as `tab[0]`.

Since `tab` is a list of string representations of numbers with at least two elements, the first element `tab[0]` could be any string representation of a number, but we don't have the exact value. However, we know it's the first element of the list.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Based on the provided information, the output will be the first element of the list `tab` followed by a space.

Output: **tab[0] ** (where `tab[0]` is the first element of the list `tab`)
