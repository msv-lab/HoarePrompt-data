The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`. Since `Max` is equal to `k`, the new value of `k` becomes `k - k`, which is `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is `0`, `rep` is `0`, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is `1`, `Min` is `1`, `Max` is `k`**. 

Note: Since `k` is now `0`, the precondition that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k` is still valid because `n` is a positive integer and `0` is less than or equal to any positive integer.
