Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is t, n is 0 or less than k, k is 0, rep is the number of iterations (less than 60), tab is a list of string representations of the numbers calculated, number is the last number calculated. The current value of k is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is t, `n` is 0 or less than k, `k` is 0, `rep` is the number of iterations (less than 60), `tab` is a list of string representations of numbers with at least one element, `number` is the last number calculated

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t`, `n` is 0 or less than k, `k` is 0, `rep` is the number of iterations (less than 60), `tab` is a list of string representations of numbers with at least one element, `number` is the last number calculated, `i` is the next element in `tab`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t`, `n` is 0 or less than `k`, `k` is 0, `rep` is the number of iterations (less than 60), `tab` is a list of string representations of numbers with at least two elements, `number` is the last number calculated, `i` is the next element in `tab` after the current `i`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
