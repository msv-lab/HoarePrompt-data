The code snippet increments the value of `rep` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `rep` is 2, after executing `rep += 1`, `rep` will be 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 0, `rep` is 3, `tab` is either `['1', '1', '1']` or `['3', '2', '1']` or `['1', '1', 'n']` or `['3', '2', 'n']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is `n`, `k` is 0 or `1 - n` depending on initial conditions, `number` is `n` or 1 depending on initial conditions.**
