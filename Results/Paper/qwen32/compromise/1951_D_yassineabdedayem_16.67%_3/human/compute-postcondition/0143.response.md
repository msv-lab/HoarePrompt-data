Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: The value of `t` is not specified, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. **n**: The value of `n` is 0 or less than `k`. However, the exact value of `n` is not relevant to the print statement.
3. **k**: The value of `k` is explicitly stated to be 0.
4. **rep**: The variable `rep` represents the number of iterations, and it is less than 60. However, the exact value of `rep` is not relevant to the print statement.
5. **tab**: `tab` is a list of string representations of the numbers calculated. The exact contents of this list are not provided, but we are told that the current value of `k` is 0. Since `k` is 0, and there is no information provided about any iterations or calculations that would populate `tab`, we can reasonably infer that `tab` is an empty list.
6. **number**: `number` is the last number calculated. Since `tab` is likely empty (as `k` is 0 and no iterations have occurred), `number` is not relevant to the print statement.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(len(tab))
```
This statement prints the length of the list `tab`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `tab` is an empty list (as `k` is 0 and no iterations have occurred to populate it), the length of `tab` is 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
