To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and any implicit or explicit information about the variable `i`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is 0 or a value less than `k`.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is the total number of iterations executed by the loop (up to 60).
- `tab` is `["1"]`.

### Key Observations:
- Since `k` is 0, the condition `n < k` can only be true if `n` is 0.
- `rep` is mentioned as the total number of iterations executed by the loop, but there is no explicit loop in the provided code snippet. Therefore, we need to infer the context of `rep` based on the loop's structure.
- The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state. However, given the context of loops and iterations, `i` is likely an index or counter variable used within a loop.

### Inference:
- Since `rep` is the total number of iterations up to 60, it suggests that there is a loop that runs up to 60 times.
- The `print(i, end=' ')` statement is likely inside this loop, and `i` is the loop counter.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` statement means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline after each print call, implying that multiple values of `i` will be printed on the same line separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
- Without the exact loop structure, we can only infer that `i` will take on values from 0 to `rep - 1` (since loop counters typically start at 0).
- Given `rep` can be up to 60, `i` will take values from 0 to 59.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `rep` is not provided, we can only describe the output based on the maximum possible iterations:
Output: **0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 (where i takes values from 0 to rep-1 and rep is the total number of iterations up to 60)**

However, if we assume the loop runs exactly 60 times (as `rep` could be 60), the output would be:
Output: **0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59**
