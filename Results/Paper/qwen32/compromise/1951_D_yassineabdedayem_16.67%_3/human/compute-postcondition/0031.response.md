The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`. Given the initial conditions, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. Therefore, the new value of `k` is `k - max(int(n / k), k)`. 

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `number`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n >= k` and `n - Min * Max` > 0 and `n - Min * Max` >= `k`; `k` is `k - max(int(n / k), k)`; `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and now also contains the string representation of `number` appended to it; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.**
