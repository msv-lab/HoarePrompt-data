Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 2, `k` is either 0 or 2, `rep` is 0, `tab` is either `['1']` or `['3']`, `number` is either 1 or 3, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 3. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 2 and `number` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decremented by `Min * Max`, which is `1 * 3 = 3`. Initially, `n` is 5, so after the operation, `n` becomes `5 - 3 = 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
