The code snippet `k = k - Min` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Min` from it. `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`. Since `n` is `k + 1`, we can substitute `n` in the expression for `Min`:

- `Min = min((k + 1) // k, k)`
- Since `k + 1` divided by `k` is `1` (because `k + 1` is just one more than `k`), `Min` simplifies to `min(1, k)`, which is `1` (as long as `k` is greater than 1).

So, `k` is updated to `k - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is `t`
- `n` is `k + 1` (now `k` is `k - 1`, so `n` is `(k - 1) + 1` which simplifies back to `k`)
- `rep` is `2`
- `tab` is `['number', str(number)]`
- `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` (now `n` is `k` and `k` is `k - 1`, so `Max` is `max(int(k / (k - 1)), k - 1)`, which simplifies to `max(1, k - 1)` and remains `k - 1` if `k` was initially `2`, or `k` if `k` was greater than `2`)
- `number` is `Max` (which is `k - 1` if `k` was initially `2`, or `k` if `k` was greater than `2`)

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is `k`, `rep` is `2`, `tab` is `['number', str(number)]`, `Min` is `1`, `Max` is `max(1, k - 1)`, `number` is `max(1, k - 1)`, `k` is `k - 1`**
