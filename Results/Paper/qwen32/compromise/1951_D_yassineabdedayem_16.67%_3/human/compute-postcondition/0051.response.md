Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is 0 or a value less than `k`; `k` is either 0 or a positive integer; if `k` is 0, then `rep` is 2 and `tab` is `["1", "2"]`; otherwise, `rep` is the total number of iterations executed by the loop (up to 60) and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration.**
