The code snippet updates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the expressions `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)`, respectively. Given the initial state, these calculations will be performed using the existing values of `n` and `k`.

Let's update the values of `Min` and `Max`:

- `Min` will be the smaller value between `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` will be the larger value between `int(n / k)` and `k`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n >= k` and `n - Min * Max` > 0 and `n - Min * Max` >= `k`; `k` is a positive integer such that `k - Min` <= n and `k` has been updated based on the initial conditions; `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and now also contains the string representation of `number` appended to it; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

In simpler terms, `Min` and `Max` have been recalculated, but all other conditions and variable values remain the same.
