The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `tab`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer; `rep` is 0; `number` is 0; `tab` is an empty list.**
