The code snippet `tab.append(str(number))` appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`.

Given the initial state, `number` is either 1 or 2 based on the conditions provided. Therefore, `tab`, which was either `['1']` or `['3']`, will be updated to either `['1', '1']` or `['3', '2']` depending on the value of `number`.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 2, `rep` is 1, `tab` is either `['1', '1']` or `['3', '2']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 2. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 1 and `number` is 2.**
