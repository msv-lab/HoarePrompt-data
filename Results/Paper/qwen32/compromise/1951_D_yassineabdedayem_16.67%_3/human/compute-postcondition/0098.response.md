Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is defined as `t-1`, but `t` is not explicitly given a value, so we can ignore this for the current print statement.
- `n` is `0`.
- `k` is `0`.
- `rep` is `3`.
- `tab` is a list `['3', '2', '1', 'new_element']`.
- `i` is `'new_element'`.
- `number` is `1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is instructed to print the value of variable `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is explicitly set to `'new_element'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of `i`, which is `'new_element'`, followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **new_element **
