The code snippet `n -= Min * Max` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `n` is a non-zero integer, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, and `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. After the operation, the new value of `n` will be `n - Min * Max`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n = n - Min * Max`; `k` is a positive integer such that `k - Min` <= n; `rep` is 0; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is min(n // k, k); `Max` is max(int(n / k), k). If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `number` is `Max`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
