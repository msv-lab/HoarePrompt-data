Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 5, `k` is 2, `rep` is 0, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is 3, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 3, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

Natural Language: The value of `k` has been updated to `k - Min`, which is `3 - 1 = 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` is still valid since `Max` (3) is not equal to the new `k` (2).
