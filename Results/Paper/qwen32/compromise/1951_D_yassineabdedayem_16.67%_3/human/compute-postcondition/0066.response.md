The code snippet `tab.append(str(number))` adds the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. Given that `number` is either 1 or 3, `tab` will now contain either `['1']` or `['3']`. 

The other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `t` is still `t-1`, `n` is still 5, `k` is either 0 or 2, `rep` is still 0, `Min` is still 1, and `Max` is still 3. The condition that determines the value of `k` and `number` based on `Max` and `n * Min` is not affected by the code snippet and remains valid as described.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 5, `k` is either 0 or 2, `rep` is 0, `tab` is either `['1']` or `['3']`, `number` is either 1 or 3, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 3. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 2 and `number` is 3.**
