The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it attempts to reduce `k` to zero by repeatedly subtracting the product of two derived values from `n`. If `k` is reduced to zero, it outputs 'YES', the number of steps taken, and the sequence of values used in the reduction. If `k` cannot be reduced to zero, it outputs 'NO'.
