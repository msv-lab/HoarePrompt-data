Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a list `a` containing multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a list starting with two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function determines and returns a value based on the ratings relative to the cow at index `k`. The return value can be `n - 1`, `k - 1`, an index minus one, or the maximum or minimum of certain differences between indices, depending on the conditions met during execution.**
