Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x`, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is not equal to 1. `ind[0]` is not equal to 0. If `k` is 14, then `k` is 14. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.**
