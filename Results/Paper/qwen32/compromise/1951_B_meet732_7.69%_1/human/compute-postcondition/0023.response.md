Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x`, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is not equal to 1. `ind[0]` is not equal to 0. `k` is greater than the value of `ind[1]`. If `k` was originally 14, it remains 14; otherwise, its value remains unchanged from its initial state.**
