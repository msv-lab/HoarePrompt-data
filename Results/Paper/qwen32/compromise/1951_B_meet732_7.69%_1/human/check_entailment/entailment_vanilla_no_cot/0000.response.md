Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Let's analyze why:

1. **Global Variables and Scope Issues**: The variable `n` is used inside `func_1`, but it is not defined within the scope of `func_1`. This will cause an error because `n` is only defined in the main loop.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Wins**: The logic for determining the maximum number of wins is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the conditions for swapping and the subsequent matches. 

3. **Hardcoded Debug Statement**: The line `if k == 14: print(ind)` is a hardcoded debug statement that should not be present in the final solution.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_1` is called with a list `a` that is not passed correctly from the main loop, and the function is not designed to handle multiple test cases properly.

5. **Edge Cases Not Considered**: The program does not correctly handle edge cases, such as when `k` is 1 or `n`, and when the cow's rating is the highest or lowest.

To correct the program, we need to properly handle the logic for determining the maximum number of wins, including the possibility of swapping the cow's position optimally. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_wins(a, k):
    n = len(a)
    k -= 1
    x = a[k]
    left_wins = 0
    right_wins = 0
    
    # Calculate wins if no swap is made
    for i in range(k + 1, n):
        if a[i] > x:
            break
        right_wins += 1
    
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if a[i] > x:
            break
        left_wins += 1
    
    max_wins = max(left_wins, right_wins)
    
    # Try swapping with each possible cow
    for i in range(n):
        if i == k:
            continue
        a[k], a[i] = a[i], a[k]
        x = a[k]
        left_wins = 0
        right_wins = 0
        
        for j in range(k + 1, n):
            if a[j] > x:
                break
            right_wins += 1
        
        for j in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
            if a[j] > x:
                break
            left_wins += 1
        
        max_wins = max(max_wins, max(left_wins, right_wins))
        a[k], a[i] = a[i], a[k]  # Swap back
    
    return max_wins

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_wins(a, k))
```

This corrected version properly calculates the maximum number of wins for each test case by considering the possibility of swapping the cow's position with any other cow and then simulating the matches to determine the number of wins.
