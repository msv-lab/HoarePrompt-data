You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
1. Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
2. String `c` does not match the template `t`.

A template `t` can have either lowercase or uppercase letters. For a string `s` to match a template `t`:
- If the `i-th` character of `t` is lowercase, the `i-th` character of `s` must be the same.
- If the `i-th` character of `t` is uppercase, the `i-th` character of `s` must be different from the lowercase version of the `i-th` character of `t`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem with the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It initializes a flag `no` to `True`.
4. It checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If so, it sets `no` to `False` and prints "NO".
5. If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, it iterates through each character of `c` to see if there is any character in `c` that is not present in `a` and `b`. If such a character exists, it prints "YES" and sets `no` to `False`.
6. If no such character is found, it prints "NO" based on the `no` flag.

### Flaws in the Program

The logic in the provided program has several flaws:
1. **Checking `c == a or c == b`:** This check is not sufficient to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match `t` and `c` does not. It only checks if `c` is identical to `a` or `b`, which is not the only condition for the answer to be "NO".
2. **Iterating through characters of `c`:** The loop `for x in c` checks if any character in `c` is not present in `a` and `b`. This condition is also not sufficient. The template `t` can have uppercase characters that prevent `c` from matching while still allowing `a` and `b` to match.
3. **Template Construction:** The program does not attempt to construct a template `t` that satisfies the conditions. It only checks some basic conditions without actually trying to find such a template.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. For each position `i` from 1 to `n`, determine the character in the template `t` based on the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b`.
2. Ensure that `c` does not match the constructed template `t`.

### Conclusion

Given the flaws in the provided program, it does not correctly determine if there exists a template `t` that satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
