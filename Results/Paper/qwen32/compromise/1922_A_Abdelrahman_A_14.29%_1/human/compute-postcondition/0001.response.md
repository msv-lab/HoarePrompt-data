The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is `i` and the range it iterates over, which is `tests`. To ensure the loop can execute, `tests` must be at least 1. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `tests` is at least 1. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as they are since they do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`tests` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0**
