Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of the same length `n`. For each test case, it determines if string `c` can be formed using characters from either `a` or `b` or if it contains at least one character not present in both `a` and `b`. It prints 'YES' if such a character exists, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
