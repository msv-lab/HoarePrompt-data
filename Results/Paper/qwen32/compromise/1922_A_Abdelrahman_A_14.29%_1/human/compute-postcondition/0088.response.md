Postcondition: **`tests` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the value provided by the input, `i` is 2, and `slength` is the integer value provided by the input. `no` is True, indicating that `c` is neither equal to `a` nor `b` and not all elements of `c` are in `a` or `b`.**
