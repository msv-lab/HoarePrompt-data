`slength` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `tests`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is still 0.

Output State: **`tests` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer.**
