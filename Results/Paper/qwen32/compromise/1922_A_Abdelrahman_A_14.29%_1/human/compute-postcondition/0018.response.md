The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'YES'.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides a context about several variables (`tests`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `slength`, `x`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
