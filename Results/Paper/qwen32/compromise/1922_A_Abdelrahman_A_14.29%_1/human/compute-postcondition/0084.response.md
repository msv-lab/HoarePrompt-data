Postcondition: **`tests` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `slength` is the integer value provided by the input, `x` is the third element of `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, then `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.**
