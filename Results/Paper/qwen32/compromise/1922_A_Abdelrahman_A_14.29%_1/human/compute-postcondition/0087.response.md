Postcondition: **`tests` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the value provided by the input, `i` is 2, and `slength` is the integer value provided by the input. If `c` is equal to `a` or `c` is equal to `b`, then `no` is False. Otherwise, `no` is True if all elements of `c` are in `a` or `b`, otherwise `no` is False.**
