The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about various variables (`tests`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `slength`, `x`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the content of the `print` statement itself.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the print statement**: The statement is `print('YES')`.
2. **Determine the content**: The content to be printed is the string `'YES'`.
3. **Variable usage**: None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`tests`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `slength`, `x`) are used in the `print` statement. Thus, their values do not affect the output.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
