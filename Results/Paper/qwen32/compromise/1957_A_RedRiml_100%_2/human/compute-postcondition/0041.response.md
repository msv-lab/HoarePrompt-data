The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations left in the loop. The loop will execute as long as the number of iterations (controlled by `w`) is greater than 0. 

Given that `w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive at the end of the previous iteration, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `w` should be decremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:
State: **`w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, and `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
