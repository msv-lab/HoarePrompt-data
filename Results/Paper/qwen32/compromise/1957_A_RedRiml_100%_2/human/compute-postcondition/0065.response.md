The code snippet `pl.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` is the next element in `palka`, it will be added to the end of `pl`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from new input and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is `1` if it was `None` before, or incremented by `1` if it was already present, `pl` contains the current value of `i` if `i` was not already in `pl` and now includes the next element from `palka`, and `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**

In simpler terms: The list `pl` now includes the next element from `palka`. All other variables remain unchanged.
