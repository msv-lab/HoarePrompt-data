The code assigns the value `1` to `d[i]`. The previous state of `d[i]` was `None`, which is now updated. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with `d[i]` equal to `1`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
