Output State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key `i` such that `d.get(i)` is not `None` and `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1, while all other variables retain their initial state.
