Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the new input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer. If `i` was not in `pl`, then `pl` now contains the single element `i` and `shapes` is 0. If `i` was not in `pl` and `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` is now `{i: 1}`. If `i` was not in `pl` and `d.get(i)` was not `None`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. If `i` was already in `pl`, the state of `pl` and `shapes` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the next element in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d` did not have the key `i` before the execution, it now has the key `i` with the value `1`. If `d` already had the key `i`, its value is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `i` was not in `pl` before the execution, `pl` now includes `i` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`, `d` is a dictionary. If `i` was not in `d` before the execution, `d` now includes the key `i` with the value `1`. If `i` was already in `d`, its value is incremented by 1. Additionally, `pl` now includes `i` as its last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
