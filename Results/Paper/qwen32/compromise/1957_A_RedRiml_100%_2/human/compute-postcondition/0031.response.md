The code snippet `shapes += d[j] // 3` increases the value of `shapes` by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3. Given that `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, the value of `shapes` will increase by at least 1. The other variables (`w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, and `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`.**
