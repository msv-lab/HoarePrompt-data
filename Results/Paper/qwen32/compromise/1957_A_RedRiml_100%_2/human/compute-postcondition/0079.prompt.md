Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer from `palka`, and `shapes` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer from `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is the previous value of `shapes` plus `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer from `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is the previous value of `shapes` plus `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged. `j` is the next element in `pl`. If `d[j]` was greater than or equal to 3, the value of `shapes` has been updated by adding `d[j] // 3` to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer from `palka`, `j` is the next element in `pl`. If `d[j] >= 3`, `shapes` is updated to its old value plus `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
