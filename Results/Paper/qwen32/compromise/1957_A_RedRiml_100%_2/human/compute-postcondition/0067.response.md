To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided information:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive.
   - `ln` is an input integer.
   - `palka` is a list of integers.
   - `pl` is an empty list.
   - `d` is an empty dictionary.
   - `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` in `palka`, the loop checks if `i` is in `d`.
     - If `i` is not in `d`, it sets `d[i]` to `1`.
     - If `i` is already in `d`, it increments `d[i]` by `1`.
   - If `i` is not in `pl`, it appends `i` to `pl`.
   - `shapes` is calculated as the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `d` will contain the count of each unique integer in `palka`.
   - `pl` will contain all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
   - `shapes` will be the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` by 3, where the count is at least 3.

Given these points, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `w` remains between 0 and 99 inclusive.
- `ln` remains the input integer.
- `palka` remains the list of integers obtained from the input.
- `pl` will be a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- `d` will be a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and each value is the count of that integer in `palka`.
- `shapes` will be the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.

Output State: **`w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer from `palka`, and `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
