The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the list `palka`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If `palka` has at least one integer, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least one integer, and `i` was the last element processed.

To execute the loop one more time, `palka` must still have at least one integer left to process. Since `i` is the loop variable that takes on the value of each element in `palka` one by one, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `palka`.

Given that `palka` is a list of integers from the new input and must have at least one integer, and considering that `i` was the last element processed, `i` should now be the next element in the list.

State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the next element in `palka`**
