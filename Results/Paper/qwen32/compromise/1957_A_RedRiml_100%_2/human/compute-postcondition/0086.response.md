The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `palka`. The loop will execute if `palka` has at least one element. The variables `w`, `ln`, `pl`, `d`, and `shapes` are not in the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `palka` must contain at least one integer. The state of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it will be assigned the first element of `palka` during the first iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `palka` contains at least one integer.

State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`**
