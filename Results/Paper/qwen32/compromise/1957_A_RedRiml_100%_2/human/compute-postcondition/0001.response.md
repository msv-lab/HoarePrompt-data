The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used) and `w`, which represents the number of test cases. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `w`. If `w` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `w` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop will execute.

Given that `w` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be between 1 and 100, the loop will execute if `w` is within this range. The value of `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is just a placeholder.

State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive**
