The code snippet provided is `pl = []`, which reassigns the list `pl` to be an empty list. This means that any previous contents of `pl` are discarded. However, the other variables (`w`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`, and `shapes`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the previous `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the previous `palka`, and `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
