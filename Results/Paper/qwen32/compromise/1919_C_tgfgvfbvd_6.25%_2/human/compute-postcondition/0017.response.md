The code snippet `b = l[y]` updates the value of `b` to the element at index `y` in the list `l`. Given that `y` is initially set to 2, `b` will now hold the value of `l[2]`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `a` remains the first element of `l`.
- `c` remains 0.
- `y` remains 2.
- `b` is now the value of `l[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `c` is 0, `y` is 2, `b` is `l[2]`.**
