Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `c` is 0, `y` is 2, `b` is `l[2]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
