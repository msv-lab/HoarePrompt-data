Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `y` is such that `y + 1 < n`
- `n` is greater than `y + 1`
- `x` is `y + 3`

Code Snippet:
```python
b = l[x]
```

Here, `b` is assigned the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l`. The value of `x` is `y + 3`.

Output State: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`; `n` is greater than `y + 1`; `x` is `y + 3`; `b` is `l[y + 3]`.**

This means that after executing the code, the variable `b` holds the value of the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
