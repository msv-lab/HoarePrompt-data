Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor (or 0 if no such element exists), `c` is 0, `y` is the index where the loop stopped (either due to breaking or completing all iterations), and `n` is the length of the list `l`.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l` or an updated value based on the conditions, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor (or 0 if no such element exists) or an updated value based on the conditions, `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and `n` is the length of the list `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than `a`; `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[4]` depending on the conditions, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor (or 0 if no such element exists) or `l[4]` depending on the conditions, `c` is 2 if `l[4]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 1 if `l[4]` is greater than either `a` or `b` but not both, and `c` is 0 if `l[4]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, `y` is 0, and `n` is the length of the list `l`. `x` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[5]` depending on the conditions, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor (or 0 if no such element exists) or `l[5]` depending on the conditions, `c` is 3 if `l[4]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 2 if `l[4]` is greater than either `a` or `b` but not both, and `c` is 1 if `l[4]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, `y` is 0, and `n` is the length of the list `l`. `x` is 5. If `l[5] > a` and `l[5] > b`, then `b` is updated to `l[5]` if `l[5] - a >= l[5] - b`; otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[4]` and `b` is updated to `l[5]`. If `l[5]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[5]` if `l[5] < a` and `l[5] < b`, and `a - l[5] <= b - l[5]`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[5]` if `a < l[5]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
