Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor (or 0 if no such element exists), `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and `n` is the length of the list `l`. The current element `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, and the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`.**
