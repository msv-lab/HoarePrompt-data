Postcondition: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, `n` is greater than `y + 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` or `b` is set to `l[x]` depending on whether `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` or `a >= l[x]`. In both cases, `c` is incremented by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`.**
