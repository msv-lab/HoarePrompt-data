The only variables in the loop head are `y` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `y` and `n`. If `y` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `y` should be 2. The value of `n` remains the same since it defines the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `y` is 2**
