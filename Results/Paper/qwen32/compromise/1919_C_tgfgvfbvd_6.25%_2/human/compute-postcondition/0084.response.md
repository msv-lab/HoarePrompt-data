To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `y` and `n`.

Given:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration: `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `y` is 0. If the current value of `l[y]` is greater than `l[y - 1]`, then `b` is set to `a`. Otherwise, `b` remains 0 and `c` remains 0.

The loop statement:
```python
for y in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop statement, we know that `y` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Since `y` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `y` is 1**. 

Note that the values of `b` and `c` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop statement alone. However, they would be determined by the logic inside the loop body, which is omitted here.
