Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input that must contain at least one element greater than its preceding element, `a` is either the first element of the list `l` or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `c` is 2 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than either `a` or `b`, and `c` is 0 if `l[x]` is not greater than either `a` or `b`. `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element, and `y` must be less than `n-1`, `x` is `y + 2`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is set to 2. If `l[x]` is greater than either `a` or `b` but not both, then `c` is set to 1. If `l[x]` is not greater than either `a` or `b`, then `c` is set to 0. Additionally, if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, `a` is set to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[y + 2]`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[y + 2]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`.**
