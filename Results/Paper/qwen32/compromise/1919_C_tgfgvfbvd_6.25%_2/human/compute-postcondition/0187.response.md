Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l` or an updated value based on the conditions, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor (or 0 if no such element exists) or an updated value based on the conditions, `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and `n` is the length of the list `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than `a`; `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than `a`.**
