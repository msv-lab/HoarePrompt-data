Output State: **`n` is an input integer, the range is determined by this integer input `n` such that there are still iterations left to complete.**

Natural Language: The variable `n` is now assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user. The precondition about the range being determined by this integer input `n` and having iterations left to complete remains valid.
