Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is `l[2]` if `l[2]` is greater than `l[1]`, otherwise `b` remains 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 3, and `n` is greater than 1. If `l[3]` is greater than `l[2]`, then `b` is updated to `l[3]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b`.**
