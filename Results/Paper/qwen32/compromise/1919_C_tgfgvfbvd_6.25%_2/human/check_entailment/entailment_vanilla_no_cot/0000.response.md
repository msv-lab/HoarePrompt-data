Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The logic used in the program does not effectively split the array into two subsequences to minimize the penalty. The program seems to be attempting to track two values `a` and `b` and count certain transitions, but it does not properly account for all possible splits of the array to achieve the optimal result.

To solve this problem optimally, one approach is to recognize that the minimum penalty can be achieved by splitting the array such that one subsequence is strictly increasing and the other is not contributing to the penalty (can be empty or non-increasing). However, the current implementation does not follow this logic and thus is incorrect.
