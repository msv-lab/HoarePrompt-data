Output State: **The function `func` takes no arguments but operates on input provided through standard input. The input begins with an integer `a` (1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. Each of the following `a` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively, for that test case.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the first integer input, which indicates the number of test cases. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
