Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly computes the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input string `n` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` with this string.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Inside `func_1`, the length of the string `s` is stored in `n`.
   - An empty string `ans` is initialized to store the final result.
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized with a single key-value pair `{0: 0}`, representing the balance of the prefix before the first character.

3. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - For each character, it updates the balance:
     - If the character is '(', it increments the balance by 1.
     - If the character is ')', it decrements the balance by 1.
   - The balance at each position `i + 1` is stored in the dictionary `d` with the key `i + 1`.

4. **Removing the Last Balance Entry:**
   - After the loop, the program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` corresponding to the balance after the last character. This is unnecessary because it doesn't affect the final result and can be omitted.

5. **Sorting:**
   - The dictionary `d` is sorted by balance values in increasing order. In case of ties (same balance), the positions are sorted in decreasing order (achieved by sorting by the negative of the position).
   - The sorting is done using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])`. However, this is incorrect because it only sorts by the balance and does not consider the position for tie-breaking. The correct sorting should be `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))`.

6. **Reconstructing the Result:**
   - The program then constructs the result string `ans` by concatenating the characters from the original string `s` in the order determined by the sorted dictionary `d`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program does not correctly handle the tie-breaking rule for sorting. It should sort primarily by balance and secondarily by position in decreasing order.
- The removal of the last entry in the dictionary `d` is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of the algorithm.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the tie-breaking rule for sorting. The correct sorting should be done with a secondary key that sorts positions in decreasing order.

**Correctness: False**
