Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`.**

In simpler terms, the string `s` remains unchanged, and a new variable `n` is introduced, which holds the length of the string `s`.
