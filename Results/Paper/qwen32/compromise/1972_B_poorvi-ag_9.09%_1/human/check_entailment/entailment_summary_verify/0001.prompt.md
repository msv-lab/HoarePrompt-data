You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of coins and their orientations ("U" for up, "D" for down). For each test case, it checks if the number of coins is odd and if there are more coins facing up than down. If both conditions are met, it outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves a circular arrangement of coins, each either facing up ("U") or down ("D"). Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The game ends when no facing-up coins remain, and the player who cannot make a move loses. We need to determine the winner assuming both players play optimally.

### Key Observations
1. **Even Number of Coins (n % 2 == 0)**:
   - If the number of coins is even, the game can be shown to always end with the second player (Bob) winning if both play optimally. This is because the game state can be manipulated in such a way that Bob always has a move when Alice does, and Alice will eventually be left without a move.

2. **Odd Number of Coins (n % 2 != 0)**:
   - If the number of coins is odd, the game's outcome depends on the initial distribution of "U" and "D". If the number of "U" coins is greater than the number of "D" coins, Alice can force a win by strategically choosing coins to remove. Otherwise, Bob can force a win.

### Provided Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins and their initial state. It then determines the winner based on the following logic:
- If the number of coins is even, it outputs "no" (Bob wins).
- If the number of coins is odd and the number of "U" coins is greater than the number of "D" coins, it outputs "yes" (Alice wins).
- Otherwise, it outputs "no" (Bob wins).

### Correctness of the Program
- **Even Number of Coins**: The program correctly identifies that Bob wins when the number of coins is even, aligning with the key observation.
- **Odd Number of Coins**: The program correctly identifies that Alice wins if there are more "U" coins than "D" coins, and Bob wins otherwise, which is also in line with the key observation.

### Conclusion
The logic implemented in the program matches the problem's requirements and correctly determines the winner for each test case based on the provided conditions.
