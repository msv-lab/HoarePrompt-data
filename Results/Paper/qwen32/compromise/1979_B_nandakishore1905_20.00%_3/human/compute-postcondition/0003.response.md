Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the difference between `n` and `m` and prints this value. The printed value is determined by specific conditions related to the difference being a power of two, or whether one of the integers is zero and the other is odd or even.**
