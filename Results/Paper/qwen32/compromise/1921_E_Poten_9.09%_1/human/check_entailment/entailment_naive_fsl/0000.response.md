Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Upon reviewing the provided program, I've identified several potential issues and edge cases that the program does not handle correctly according to the problem description.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Alice's Turn Logic**:
   - The program checks if Alice's initial row position `x_a` is greater than Bob's initial row position `x_b` or if the board has only one row (`h == 1`). If true, it immediately declares a "Draw". This is incorrect because Alice can still win if she can reach Bob's position before he can move out of the board, even if `x_a > x_b`.
   - The program then checks if both `x_a` and `x_b` are even or both are odd. If true, it further checks the column positions to determine the winner. However, this logic is complex and does not correctly account for all scenarios where Alice or Bob can win.

2. **Bob's Turn Logic**:
   - The program's logic for Bob is similarly flawed, as it does not correctly account for all scenarios where Bob can win or the game can end in a draw.

3. **General Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where Alice or Bob can move directly to the opposite player's position in one move.
   - It also does not correctly handle scenarios where the board dimensions are very large, which could affect the outcome of the game.

To illustrate the issues, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3 1 1 3 3
```
- Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (3, 3).
- Alice can move to (2, 2) on her first turn, and Bob can move to (2, 2) on his first turn, resulting in a win for Bob.
- However, the provided program will likely declare a "Draw" for this case, which is incorrect.

Another test case:
```
1
5 5 1 1 5 5
```
- Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (5, 5).
- The game will end in a draw because Alice cannot reach Bob's position before Bob moves out of the board.
- The provided program will likely declare a "Draw" for this case, which might be correct, but it does not correctly handle the logic for other cases.

Given these issues, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
