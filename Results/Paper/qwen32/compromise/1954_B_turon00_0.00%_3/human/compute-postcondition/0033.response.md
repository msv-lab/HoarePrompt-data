The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `ans`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
