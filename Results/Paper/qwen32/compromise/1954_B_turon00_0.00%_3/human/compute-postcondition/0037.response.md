Postcondition: **`ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, the conditions remain as described; otherwise, there is no change in the variables.**
