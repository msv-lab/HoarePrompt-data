Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an integer input.
3. `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.
4. `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`.
5. `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, and it is given that the length of `aa` is 1. This implies that all elements in the list `a` are identical.

### Code Analysis:
The given code snippet is:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, or `aa`. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1**
