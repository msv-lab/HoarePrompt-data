Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `ans` is `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `cnt` is 2 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so if `cnt` was initially 1 (as per the initial state), it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
