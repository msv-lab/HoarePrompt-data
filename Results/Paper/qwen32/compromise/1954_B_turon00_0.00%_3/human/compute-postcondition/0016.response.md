The code snippet provided is simply `cnt = 0`, which reassigns the value of `cnt` to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
