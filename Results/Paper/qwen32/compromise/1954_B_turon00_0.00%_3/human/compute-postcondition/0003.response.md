The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. This means the variable `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
