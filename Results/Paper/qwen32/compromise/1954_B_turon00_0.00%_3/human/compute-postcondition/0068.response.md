Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`; `t` is `t - 1` and remains greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the new input list of integers; `tmp` remains `a[0]`; `aa` is the set containing unique elements from `a`; `cnt` is 0.**

In simple terms, the value of `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their previous values.
