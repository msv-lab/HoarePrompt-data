The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The initial state mentions `i` as `i + 1`, but this does not affect the execution of the given code snippet. Therefore, the value of `i` remains as `i + 1` in the output state.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`**.
