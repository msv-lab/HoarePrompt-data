The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n`.

State: **`ans` is `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `i` is `i + 1`**
