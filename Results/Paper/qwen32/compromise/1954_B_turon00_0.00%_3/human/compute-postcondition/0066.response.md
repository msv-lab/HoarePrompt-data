The `print(-1)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The initial state provides information about several variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `cnt`), but none of these are used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
