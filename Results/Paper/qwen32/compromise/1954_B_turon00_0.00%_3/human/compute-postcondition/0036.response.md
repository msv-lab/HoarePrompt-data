The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

The `print` statement is straightforward and simply outputs the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
