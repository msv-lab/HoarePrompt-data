The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `ans`, `t`, `a`, `tmp`, and `aa` does not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`ans` is `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`**
