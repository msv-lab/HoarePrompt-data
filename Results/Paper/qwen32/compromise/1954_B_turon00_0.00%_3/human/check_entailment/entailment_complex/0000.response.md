### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. The approach taken by the program is to find the shortest contiguous subarray that contains only the most frequent element at the start of the array. If the array consists of only one unique element, it outputs `-1` because it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `a`.

2. **Check for Uniform Array**: It checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set and checking its length. If the length of the set is 1, it prints `-1` because the array is already uniform and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding Minimum Contiguous Subarray**: If the array is not uniform, the program tries to find the shortest contiguous subarray starting from the first element that contains only the first element `tmp`. It does this by iterating through the array and counting the length of contiguous subarrays that contain only `tmp`. It keeps track of the minimum length of such subarrays.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the minimum length of the contiguous subarray found, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correctness:

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, which means it should consider all possible elements in the array, not just the first one. The current implementation only considers the first element and finds the shortest contiguous subarray of that element. This approach is flawed because the array can have multiple elements, and the solution should consider the shortest contiguous subarray for any element that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The program will find the shortest contiguous subarray of `3` which is the entire array itself, and it will output `7`, but the correct answer is `3` because removing the first three `3`s will make the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
