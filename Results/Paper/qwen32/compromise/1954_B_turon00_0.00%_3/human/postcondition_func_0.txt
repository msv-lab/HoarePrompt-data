The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines and prints the minimum length of any contiguous subarray within `a` that contains only the most frequent element, or `-1` if all elements in `a` are the same.
