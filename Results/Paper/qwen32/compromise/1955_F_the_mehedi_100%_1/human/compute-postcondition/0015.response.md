The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` will overwrite the original list `a` with a new list of integers provided by the user input. The values of `t` and `cnt` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user input, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the original `a`**.
