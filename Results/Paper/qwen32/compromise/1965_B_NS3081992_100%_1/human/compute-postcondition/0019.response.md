To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `i` and the range parameter `l` and `lk`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(lk, l):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `l` must be greater than `lk`. This ensures that the range `range(lk, l)` is non-empty.
2. `i` is the loop variable and its initial value will be `lk` at the start of the first iteration.

The state provided before the loop starts is:
- `ans` is a list containing the first `lk - 1` powers of 2, followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, then `k + 1`, and finally `2 * k + 1`.

However, the state of `ans` does not affect the execution of the loop itself, as the loop only depends on `i`, `lk`, and `l`. Therefore, we only need to adjust `lk` and `l` to ensure the loop can execute.

### Step-by-step Adjustment:
1. **Adjust `lk` and `l`:** Ensure that `l` is greater than `lk` for the loop to execute. The exact values of `lk` and `l` are not specified, but we can assume `lk` to be any non-negative integer and `l` to be any integer greater than `lk`.

### Example Answer:
State: **`ans` is a list containing the first `lk - 1` powers of 2, followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, then `k + 1`, and finally `2 * k + 1`, `lk` is a non-negative integer, `l` must be greater than `lk`**
