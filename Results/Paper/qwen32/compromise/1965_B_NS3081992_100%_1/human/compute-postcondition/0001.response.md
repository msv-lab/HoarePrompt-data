To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided loop:

```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
    sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
```

Here's what we know:
- The loop runs `func_10()` times.
- In each iteration, it writes the string representation of `func_14()` followed by a newline to the standard output.

Since the exact implementations of `func_10()` and `func_14()` are not provided, we can only describe the output state in terms of these functions.

Output State: **The loop will execute `func_10()` times, writing the string representation of `func_14()` followed by a newline to the standard output in each iteration.**
