The given code snippet reads `n` lines of input, where each line contains `m` integers separated by spaces. These integers are used to populate a 2D list called `rows`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Since the code snippet only affects the `rows` variable, we need to describe its new state in the output. The `rows` variable is now a 2D list containing `n` sublists, each of which contains `m` integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the river grid and contains `m` integers, with the first and last integers being 0. The `rows` list has been populated with `n` rows of `m` integers each, as read from the input.**
