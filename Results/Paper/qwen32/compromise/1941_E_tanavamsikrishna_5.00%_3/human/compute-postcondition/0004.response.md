To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which in this case is `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):`. The loop will execute if the range function produces a sequence with at least one element. This means that the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Let's break it down:

1. **`len(costs)`**: This is the length of the `costs` list. The `costs` list is created by applying `func_1` to each row in the `rows` list, so `len(costs)` is equal to the number of rows, which is `n`.

2. **`k - 1`**: This is a simple arithmetic operation based on the integer `k`.

3. **`len(costs) - (k - 1)`**: For the loop to execute, this expression must be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `n - (k - 1) >= 1`, which simplifies to `n >= k`.

So, the necessary condition for the loop to execute is that `n` (the number of rows) must be greater than or equal to `k` (the number of bridges).

The other variables (`m`, `d`, `rows`, `total_costs`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head.

**State:** **`n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `m`, `k`, `d` are integers, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `costs` is a list of integers calculated from `rows` with `func_1` and `d`, `total_costs` is an empty list**.
