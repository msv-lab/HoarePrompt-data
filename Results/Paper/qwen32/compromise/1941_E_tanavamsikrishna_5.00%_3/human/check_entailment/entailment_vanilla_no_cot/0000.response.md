Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to calculate the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row. However, it incorrectly assumes that the minimum cost for each cell can be determined solely by looking at the previous `d` cells. This is not correct because the problem specifies that supports must be placed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The function does not account for these constraints properly.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The problem requires a more sophisticated approach, likely involving dynamic programming, to ensure that the constraints are met while minimizing the total cost. The function `func_1` does not use dynamic programming or any mechanism to ensure that the constraints are satisfied.

3. **Handling Multiple Bridges**: The function `func_2` correctly calculates the cost for each row using `func_1` and then sums the costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost. However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall solution is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, we would need to implement a dynamic programming solution that considers all possible placements of supports on each row while respecting the constraints. This would involve maintaining a DP table where each entry represents the minimum cost to place supports up to a certain column, considering the constraints on the distance between supports.

Here is a sketch of how the correct solution might look:

- Use a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` is the minimum cost to place supports up to column `j` in row `i`.
- Initialize the first and last columns of each row with a cost of 1 (since `a[i][1]` and `a[i][m]` are 0).
- For each cell `(i, j)` in the row, calculate the minimum cost to place a support at that cell by considering all possible previous columns where a support could have been placed, ensuring the distance constraint is met.
- After processing all rows, sum the costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost.

Given the complexity of the problem, a correct implementation would be more involved than the provided code. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
