You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

Finally, it returns the last element of the modified list.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the minimum total cost of placing `k` bridges in a grid such that the maximum distance between supports does not exceed `d`. It reads input values for the number of rows (`n`), number of columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), and maximum distance between supports (`d`). It also reads a 2D list `rows` representing the river grid. The function computes the minimum cost among all possible placements of `k` consecutive bridges in each row and prints this minimum cost.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Grid Representation**: The river is represented as an `n x m` grid where `a[i][j]` is the depth of the cell at row `i` and column `j`. The first and last columns are river banks and have a depth of 0.

2. **Bridge Construction**: We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows. Each bridge spans from the first column to the last column of a row. Supports must be placed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of placing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`. The goal is to minimize the total cost of placing supports for all `k` bridges.

### Solution Analysis

Let's break down the provided solution:

#### Function `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`

- **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row such that the distance between adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
- **Implementation**:
  - The first loop initializes the first `d-1` cells by adding 1 to their depth (since supports must be placed here).
  - The second loop iterates from `d-1` to the end of the row. For each cell, it calculates the minimum cost to place a support considering the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell) and adds 1 to the current cell's depth.
  - The function returns the cost of placing supports in the last cell of the row.

#### Function `func_2()`

- **Purpose**: This function reads the input, computes the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Implementation**:
  - It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`.
  - It reads the grid of depths.
  - It computes the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - It calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them.
  - It prints the minimum total cost.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row by considering the constraints on the distance between supports.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the given constraints. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost for each cell does not correctly enforce the constraint that the distance between adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

2. **Total Cost Calculation in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them.
   - However, since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost for each row, the overall solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to place supports in a single row while satisfying the constraints on the distance between supports.

**Correctness: False**
