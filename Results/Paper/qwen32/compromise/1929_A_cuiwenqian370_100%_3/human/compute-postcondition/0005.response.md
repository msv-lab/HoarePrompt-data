The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The other variables (`array`, `data`, `index`, and `results`) do not affect the execution of the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a representation of an integer from the input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list**
