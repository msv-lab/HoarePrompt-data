The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`. Since the value of `t` is determined by user input and is not related to `start` or `end`, these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `t` which is an integer based on the user's input, and the preconditions on `start` and `end` are still valid.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer.**
