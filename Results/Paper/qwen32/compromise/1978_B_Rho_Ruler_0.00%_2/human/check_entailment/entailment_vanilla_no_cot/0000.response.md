Correctness: **False**

The provided program is attempting to solve the problem using a binary search approach to find the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. However, the implementation of the function `func_1` is incorrect for determining the maximum profit. The function `func_1` is checking if the total revenue from selling `k` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not relevant for maximizing profit.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the revenue for each possible value of `k` (from 0 to `n`), and keep track of the maximum revenue. Here is the corrected approach:

```python
def max_profit(n, a, b):
    max_profit = 0
    for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
        profit = k * (b - k + 1) + (n - k) * a
        if profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = profit
    return max_profit

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(max_profit(n, a, b))
```

This program iterates through all possible values of `k` (from 0 to `min(n, b)`) and calculates the profit for each case, updating the maximum profit found. This ensures that we find the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price to maximize profit.
