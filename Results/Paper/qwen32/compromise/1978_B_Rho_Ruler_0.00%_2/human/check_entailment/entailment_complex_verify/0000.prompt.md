You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.

    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. It calculates a value based on these parameters and returns `True` if this calculated value is less than or equal to `n` times the maximum of `a` and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum profit Bob can obtain. The main issue is in the `func_1` function, which is supposed to determine whether a given `k` results in a profit that is less than or equal to the maximum possible profit. However, this function is not correctly calculating the profit for a given `k`.

The `func_1` function incorrectly calculates the profit by adding `k * b` and `(n - k) * a`, which does not account for the decreasing price of the first `k` buns. The correct calculation should be the sum of the series for the first `k` buns, which is `b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1)`, and then adding `(n - k) * a` for the remaining buns.

Here is the corrected logic for calculating the profit for a given `k`:

```python
def calculate_profit(k, a, b, n):
    if k == 0:
        return n * a
    # Sum of the first k terms of the series b, b-1, ..., b-k+1
    profit_first_k = k * b - (k * (k - 1)) // 2
    # Profit from the remaining (n - k) buns
    profit_remaining = (n - k) * a
    return profit_first_k + profit_remaining

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = calculate_profit(k, a, b, n)
            if profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = profit
        print(max_profit)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In the original program, the binary search approach is also not correctly implemented to find the maximum profit. The binary search is being used to find the maximum `k` that satisfies a condition, but the condition is not correctly defined, and the profit calculation inside the binary search is incorrect.

Thus, the original program does not correctly compute the maximum profit for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
