The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `_`, which is a conventional throwaway variable used when the loop variable is not needed. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. 

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to influence whether the loop executes. They are part of what will be executed inside the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1**
