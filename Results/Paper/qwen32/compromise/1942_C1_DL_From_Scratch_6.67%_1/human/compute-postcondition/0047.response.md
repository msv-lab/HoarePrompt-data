Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is `T - 1`; `n`, `x`, and `y` are new integers read from the input; `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `num` is `n - list0[-1]`. If `num` equals 1, `count` is the total number of times `num` was equal to 1 during all iterations, including this one, and `count` has been incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. `i` is `x - 2`.**
