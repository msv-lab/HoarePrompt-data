Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 1, `n` and `y` are integers read from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`. If `num` equals 1, then `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` was exactly 2, plus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**
