The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Given that `d.get(i)` is not `None`, it means that the key `i` already exists in the dictionary `d`.

Here's the impact on the variables:

- `d`: The value associated with the key `i` is incremented by 1.
- `pl`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- `shapes`: This variable depends on the counts of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`. Since the code only modifies the count of `i` in `d`, `shapes` might change if the count of `i` crosses the threshold of 3. However, without knowing the exact counts before the increment, we can't determine the new value of `shapes` precisely. It could increase by 1 if the count of `i` goes from 2 to 3, or remain the same otherwise.
- `w`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- `ln`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- `palka`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Given these points, the output state is:

Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with the value associated with key `i` incremented by 1, `pl` is an empty list, `shapes` is updated based on the new count of `i` in `d`, `w` is `k-1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element.**
