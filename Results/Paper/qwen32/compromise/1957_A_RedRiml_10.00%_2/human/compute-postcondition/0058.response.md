Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input and must contain at least one element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or its existing value incremented by 1; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times; if `i` was not in `pl` before the if statement, `pl` now contains the element `i`; `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
