Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is a list that contains the element `i` if `i` was not already in `pl` (now includes the new element `i` if `i` was not in `pl` previously); `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d[i]` is now 1, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_current`.**
