The given code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This means that if `i` was not already a key in `d`, it will now be added with a value of `1`. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value will be overwritten to `1`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that is directly affected by this line of code is the dictionary `d`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `shapes`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input and must contain at least one element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of 1; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.**
