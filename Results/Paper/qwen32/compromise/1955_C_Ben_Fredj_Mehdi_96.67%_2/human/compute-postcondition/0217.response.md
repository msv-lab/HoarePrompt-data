Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces.
- `z` is incremented by 1 (though `z` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1000')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'1000'`. The values of variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` are not used in this print statement. Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'1000'`.

### Output:
Output: **1000**
