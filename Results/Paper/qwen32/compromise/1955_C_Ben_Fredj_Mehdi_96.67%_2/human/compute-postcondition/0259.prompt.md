Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces; `z` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string; `d` is `len(a) - 1`; `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first and last elements are decremented by 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is decremented by 1, `k` remains at least 2, `d` is adjusted to `len(a) - 2` if the last element of `a` was 0, otherwise `d` is `len(a) - 1`, and `g` is 0 unless `a[g]` is 0, in which case `g` is updated to 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. If no exceptions occur, `a` is a list of integers where the elements at indices `g` and `d` are decremented by 1, and if they become 0, `g` is incremented by 1 or `d` is decremented by 1, respectively. `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is decremented by 1, `k` remains at least 2, `d` is adjusted based on the value of `a[d]` after decrementing, and `i` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the loop breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `g` is decremented by 1, and the element at index `d` is decremented by 1. If `a[d]` was 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If `a[g]` was 0, `g` is incremented by 1. `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is decremented by 1, `k` remains at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `k // 2`. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state is unknown.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
