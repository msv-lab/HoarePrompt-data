The `print('99')` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, or `k` described in the initial state. The string `'99'` is explicitly provided as the argument to the `print` function.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, `k`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('99')`, which directly outputs the string `'99'`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'99'`.

Output: **99**
