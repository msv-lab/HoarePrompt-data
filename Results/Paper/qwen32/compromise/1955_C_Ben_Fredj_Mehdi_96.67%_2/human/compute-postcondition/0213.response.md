Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **a**: A list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces.
3. **z**: Incremented by 1 (though `z` is not used in the print statement).
4. **n**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
5. **k**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('1')
```
This statement directly prints the string `'1'` to the console. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this print statement because the string `'1'` is explicitly specified.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'1'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1**
