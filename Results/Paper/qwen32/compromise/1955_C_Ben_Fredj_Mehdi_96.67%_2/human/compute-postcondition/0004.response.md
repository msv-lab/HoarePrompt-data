The code snippet provided extracts a substring from the string `a` starting from the character immediately after the first space and converts it to an integer, which is then assigned to the variable `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is an input string.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of `a` up to the first space.

After the execution of the code:
- `k` is assigned the value of the integer conversion of the substring of `a` starting right after the first space.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is an input string; `n` is the integer value of the substring of `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` starting right after the first space.**
