Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, where the first element of `a` (previously `n`) is now `n - 1` and the second integer in `a` (i.e., `k`) must be at least 2, and the last element of `a` is decremented by 1; `z` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space, now decremented by 1; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string and must be at least 2; `d` is `len(a) - 1`; `g` is 0. If `a[g]` (which is `a[0]`) is 0, then `g` is updated to 1.**
