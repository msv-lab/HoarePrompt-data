The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. This means `a` is now a list of integers. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `z` remain unchanged except for `z` which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `z` is incremented by 1.**
