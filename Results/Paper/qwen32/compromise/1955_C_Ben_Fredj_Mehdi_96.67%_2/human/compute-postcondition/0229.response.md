The given Python code snippet initializes a variable `g` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `d`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces; `z` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string; `d` is `len(a) - 1`; `g` is 0.**
