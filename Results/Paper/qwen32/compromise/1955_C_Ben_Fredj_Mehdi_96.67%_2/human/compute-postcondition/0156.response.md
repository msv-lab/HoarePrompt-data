The code snippet provided is `d -= 1`, which decrements the value of `d` by 1. Given the initial state, `d` is initially `len(a) - 1`. After decrementing `d`, its new value will be `len(a) - 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `z`, `g`, and `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first element `a[0]` is decremented by 1 and the last element `a[d]` is decremented by 1 and is now 0; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is an integer value of at least 2; `z` is incremented by 1; `d` is `len(a) - 2`; `g` is 1 if `a[g]` (which is `a[0]`) was 0, otherwise `g` remains 0; `i` is 0; the current value of `a[g]` (which is `a[1]` if `g` became 1) is unchanged.**
