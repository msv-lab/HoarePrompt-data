Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `k` is equal to 4294967295; `k` is not equal to 1999999998, 1999999999, 9999999999, 9999999999, 99999999999, 199999999999999, 1000000000000, 200000000000, 100000000000, 99999999999, 5999999999; it is not the case that (n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1); it is not the case that (n == 101 and k == 100000000000); it is not the case that (k == 2147483648 and n == 2); it is not the case that (n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]); it is not the case that (n == 5 and k == 2147483648); and it is not the case that (n == 20 and k == 10000000000)**

In simpler terms: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive; `a` is a list of integers; `n` is the first integer in `a`; `k` is the second integer in `a` and is equal to 4294967295; `k` does not match several specified values, and certain combinations of `n` and `k` are not allowed.**
