Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `k` is equal to 1000000000000; `k` is not equal to 1999999998, 1999999999, 9999999999, 99999999999, 199999999999999; it is not the case that (n == 1 and a[0] == 1); it is not the case that (n == 101); `k` is not equal to 9999999999, 100000000000, 99999999999999**
