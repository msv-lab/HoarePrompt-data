Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces.
3. `z` is incremented by 1 (though `z` is not used in the print statement, it's mentioned for completeness).
4. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
5. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('9')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement simply prints the string `'9'`. None of the variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, or `k` are used in this print statement. Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'9'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **9**
