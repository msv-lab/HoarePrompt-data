The code snippet reassigns the value of `k` to be the integer value of the substring of `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string. The values of `t`, `a`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is the input string; `z` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string.**
