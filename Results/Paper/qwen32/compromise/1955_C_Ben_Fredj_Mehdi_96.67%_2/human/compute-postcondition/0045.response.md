Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `k` is not equal to 1999999998, `k` is not equal to 1999999999, and `k` is not equal to 99999999999; it is not the case that (n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1); `k` is not equal to 9999999999; it is not the case that (n == 101 and k == 100000000000); `k` is not equal to 10000000000000; `k` is not equal to 99999999999999; `k` is not equal to 199999999999999; `k` is not equal to 1000000000000; `k` is not equal to 200000000000; it is not the case that (k == 2147483648 and n == 2); it is not the case that (n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]); `n` is 5 and `k` is 2147483648.**
