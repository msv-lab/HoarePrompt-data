Let's analyze the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
- `k` is explicitly set to 4294967295.
- `k` is not equal to a series of specific values (1999999998, 1999999999, 9999999999, 9999999999, 99999999999, 199999999999999, 1000000000000, 200000000000, 100000000000, 99999999999, 5999999999).
- Several specific conditions involving `n` and `k` are also provided, but none of these conditions affect the `print` statement directly.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('8')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('8')`. This statement prints the string `'8'` to the console. The value `'8'` is explicitly provided in the `print` function and does not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **8**
