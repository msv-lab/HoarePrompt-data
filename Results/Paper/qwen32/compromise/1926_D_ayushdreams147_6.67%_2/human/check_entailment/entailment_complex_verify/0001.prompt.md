You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

    #The program returns `res`, which is the number of unique numbers encountered in the list `a` that were not previously seen in terms of their bitwise complements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Understanding the Problem

The goal is to divide a list of non-negative integers into the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bit values from the 1st to the 31st bit (least significant 31 bits). 

### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `a`.
3. It then calls a function `func_1` with `n` and `a` as arguments.
4. Inside `func_1`, it initializes a result variable `res` to 0 and a dictionary `count` to keep track of something.
5. For each number in the list `a`, it checks if the number is not in the `count` dictionary:
   - If not, it adds a key corresponding to the number XORed with `(1 << 31) - 1` (which is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1) to the `count` dictionary and increments the count for that key.
   - It also increments the result `res` by 1.
   - If the number is in the `count` dictionary, it decrements the count for that number.

The logic in the program is incorrect for the following reasons:

- The XOR operation with `(1 << 31) - 1` is not relevant to the problem. The XOR operation does not help in determining if two numbers can be placed in the same group based on their bit values.
- The `count` dictionary is not used correctly to determine the minimum number of groups. The program does not check if two numbers can be placed in the same group based on their bit values.
- The program increments `res` for each number, which does not account for the fact that multiple numbers can be placed in the same group if they do not have matching bits in the specified range.

### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve using a graph coloring algorithm where each number is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if they cannot be placed in the same group (i.e., they have matching bits in the 1st to 31st bit positions). The goal is then to find the chromatic number of this graph, which represents the minimum number of groups required.

Alternatively, a simpler approach would be to use a bitset or bitmask to track the groups. For each number, we can determine which group it belongs to by checking the bit values and ensuring no two numbers in the same group have matching bit values.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis above, the provided program is incorrect.
