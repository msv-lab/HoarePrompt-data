### Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing a coin, with the player unable to make a move losing the game. The key observation here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - If the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Bob will win.
   - If the difference is odd, Alice will win.
   
   This is because:
   - If the difference is even, after each optimal move, the difference remains even. Since the game starts with an even difference, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves until Alice is forced to make the final move, leaving Bob as the winner.
   - If the difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that results in an even difference, putting Bob in the position of having to deal with an even difference, which he will eventually lose.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It calculates the absolute difference `abs(a - b)`.
   - If the difference is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
