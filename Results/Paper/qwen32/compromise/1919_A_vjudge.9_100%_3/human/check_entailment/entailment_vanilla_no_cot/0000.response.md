To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic behind the game and compare it with the logic implemented in the code.

### Game Analysis:
The game revolves around the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the player who can force the opponent into a position where the difference in the number of coins is even will win.

1. **Initial Observation**:
   - If the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (|a - b|) is even, then Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and ensure that he is always the one to take the last coin.
   - If the difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even difference for Bob, thus ensuring that Alice will be the one to take the last coin.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - If Alice and Bob play optimally, Alice wins if the initial difference is odd, and Bob wins if the initial difference is even.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- It calculates the absolute difference between the number of coins in their wallets.
- It checks if this difference is even or odd.
- If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
- If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

### Conclusion:
The logic in the code matches the optimal strategy derived from the game analysis. Therefore, the program is correct.
