To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns playing. Each player can choose to exchange wallets or keep their current wallet, and then they must remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses.

### Key Observations

1. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally. This means they will make the best possible moves to win.
2. **Turn Order**: Alice goes first.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a move loses.

### Strategy

Given two wallets with `a` and `b` coins, the game can be analyzed based on the difference between `a` and `b`.

- If `a == b`, the first player (Alice) will always lose if both play optimally. This is because no matter what Alice does, Bob can always mirror her moves, leading to a situation where Alice is forced to make the last move and lose.
- If `a != b`, the first player (Alice) can always force a win by making the difference between the wallets odd after her first move. She can achieve this by swapping the wallets if necessary, then removing a coin to make the difference odd. From there, she can always mirror Bob's moves, ensuring that she never faces a situation where both wallets are empty on her turn.

### Conclusion

- If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, Alice will lose if both play optimally.
- If `abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`, Alice will win if both play optimally.

### Program Analysis

The provided program correctly implements this logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- It calculates the absolute difference between the two wallets.
- It checks if the difference is even or odd and prints the winner based on the analysis above.

### Final Answer

The program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy.

Correctness: **True**
