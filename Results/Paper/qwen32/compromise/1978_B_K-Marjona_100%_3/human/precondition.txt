test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively. The first element of the test_cases list is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
