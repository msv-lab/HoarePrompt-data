### Reasoning:

The goal is to determine the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the sum of penalties `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized. The penalty `p(b)` of a subsequence `b` is defined as the number of indices `i` where `b[i] < b[i + 1]`.

The strategy used in the given code is to simulate the process of splitting the array into two subsequences while keeping track of the minimum penalties. The code uses two variables, `la` and `lb`, to keep track of the last added elements to the two subsequences `s` and `t`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `la` and `lb` are initialized to `n + 1`, which is a value greater than any possible element in the array.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0, which keeps track of the penalty.

2. **Processing the Array**:
   - For each element `i` in the array:
     - If `i` is less than or equal to `la`, it is added to subsequence `s` by updating `la` to `i`.
     - Else if `i` is less than or equal to `lb`, it is added to subsequence `t` by updating `lb` to `i`.
     - Else, it means `i` is greater than both `la` and `lb`. In this case, we need to "reset" the subsequences by setting `la` to `lb` and `lb` to `i`, and incrementing the penalty `ans` by 1 because we are effectively starting a new subsequence.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, the value of `ans` is printed, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

### Correctness Analysis:

The algorithm ensures that we are always trying to add an element to the subsequence with the smallest possible last element, which helps in minimizing the number of increasing pairs. The logic of resetting the subsequences when an element is greater than both `la` and `lb` ensures that we are not unnecessarily increasing the penalty.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `5, 1 2 3 4 5`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: A possible split is `s=[2,4,5]` and `t=[1,3]`. The penalties are `p(s)=2` and `p(t)=1`, so the total penalty is `3`.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `8, 8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: A possible split is `s=[8,3,1]` and `t=[2,1,7,4,3]`. The penalties are `p(s)=0` and `p(t)=1`, so the total penalty is `1`.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5, 3 3 3 3 3`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: A possible split is `s=[]` and `t=[3,3,3,3,3]`. The penalties are `p(s)=0` and `p(t)=0`, so the total penalty is `0`.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `1, 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: A possible split is `s=[]` and `t=[1]`. The penalties are `p(s)=0` and `p(t)=0`, so the total penalty is `0`.

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `2, 2 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: A possible split is `s=[2]` and `t=[1]`. The penalties are `p(s)=0` and `p(t)=0`, so the total penalty is `0`.

The code correctly handles all the provided test cases, and the logic seems sound for the given problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
