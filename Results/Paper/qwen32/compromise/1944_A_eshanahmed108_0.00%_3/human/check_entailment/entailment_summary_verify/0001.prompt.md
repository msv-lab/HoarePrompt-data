You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, it prints 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
We are given `n` islands where every pair is connected by a bridge. Dominater can destroy at most `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit starting from island 1. The goal is to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater optimally destroys up to `k` bridges.

### Key Observations:
1. **No Bridges Destroyed (`k = 0`)**: If no bridges are destroyed, Everule can visit all `n` islands.
2. **All Bridges Destroyed (`k = n*(n-1)/2`)**: If all possible bridges are destroyed, Everule can only visit island 1.
3. **Partial Bridges Destroyed (`0 < k < n*(n-1)/2`)**: Here, Dominater will try to isolate island 1 from as many other islands as possible. The optimal strategy for Dominater would be to disconnect island 1 from as many other islands as possible without isolating any other islands from each other.

### Strategy:
- If `k >= n-1`, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands because there are `n-1` bridges directly connected to island 1. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1.
- If `k < n-1`, Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands. In this case, Everule can still visit all `n` islands because there will always be a path from island 1 to any other island through other islands.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided function `func()` implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- It checks if `n - k <= 1`:
  - If true, it means that Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands (or more), so Everule can only visit island 1.
  - If false, it means that Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can visit all `n` islands.

The logic is correct based on the observations above.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater optimally destroys up to `k` bridges.
