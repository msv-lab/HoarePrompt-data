The only variable in the loop head is `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is truthy (i.e., `n` is not zero).

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to a non-zero value.

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is a sorted list of four elements `[(sorted_x1, sorted_y1), (sorted_x2, sorted_y2), (sorted_x3, sorted_y3), (sorted_x4, sorted_y4)]`; `res` is `math.sqrt((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]))`; `i` is 3; `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`; `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**
