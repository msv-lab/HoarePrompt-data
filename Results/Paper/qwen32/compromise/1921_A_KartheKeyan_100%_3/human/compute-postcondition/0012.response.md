The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state mentions that `x` and `y` are integers read from the input, but this line of code overwrites those values with new input values. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input.**
