Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is a sorted list of four tuples `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]` based on tuple comparison; `res` is 0; `i` is 4; `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]); `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`**

In this output state, the value of `p2` has been calculated as `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
