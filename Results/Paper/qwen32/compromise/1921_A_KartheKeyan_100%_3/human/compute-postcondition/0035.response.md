The code snippet recalculates the value of `p1` using the coordinates from `coord[0]` and `coord[1]`. Given that `p1` was initially defined as the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[0]` and `coord[1]`, the recalculated value of `p1` will be the same as its initial value. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 1; `coord` is a sorted list of four elements `[(sorted_x1, sorted_y1), (sorted_x2, sorted_y2), (sorted_x3, sorted_y3), (sorted_x4, sorted_y4)]`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`; `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[3]` and `coord[2]`.**
