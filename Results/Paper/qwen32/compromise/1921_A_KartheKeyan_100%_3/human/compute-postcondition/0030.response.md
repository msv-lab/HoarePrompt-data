The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit `4`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `4`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1`. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1`, so `i` will be `2`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, `x`, and `y`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 1; `coord` is a list containing two elements `[(original_x, original_y), (x, y)]` where `x` and `y` are the new values read from the input; `res` is 0; `i` is 2; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input.**
