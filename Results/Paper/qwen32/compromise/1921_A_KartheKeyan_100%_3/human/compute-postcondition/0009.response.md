The code snippet provided updates the values of `x` and `y` based on the input. The previous values of `x` and `y` in the `coord` tuple are not affected by this line of code, as the new values of `x` and `y` are read from the input and assigned directly to the variables `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100, `n` remains a non-zero integer, `coord` still contains the tuple `(x, y)` with the original values, `res` is still 0, `i` is still 3, and `x` and `y` have been updated to the new integer values read from the input.
