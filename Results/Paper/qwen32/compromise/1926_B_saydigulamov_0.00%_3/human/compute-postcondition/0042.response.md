The code snippet assigns the result of `input()` to the variable `b`. Since `input()` reads a string from the user, `b` will hold a string value. The values of `a`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `k` is an empty list still holds. The only change is that `b` now holds the user's input as a string.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `k` is an empty list, `b` is a string equal to the user's input.**
