The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid. The next n lines each contain n characters, which are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1').
