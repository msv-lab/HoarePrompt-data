Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Let's analyze why this is the case:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of the grid.

2. **Counting '1's**:
   - The program counts the number of '1's in each row and stores these counts in a list `k`.
   - It then checks if the first two counts in `k` are equal and prints the list `k` if they are.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program does not analyze the grid to determine if the '1's form a square or a triangle.
   - The check `if k[0] == k[1]:` is insufficient to determine the shape. For example, it does not account for the specific patterns required for a square or a triangle.
   - The program does not handle cases where the triangle is upside down or not centered in the grid.
   - The program does not handle cases where the square is not aligned with the left edge of the grid.
   - The program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem description.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
010
111
010
```
- The correct output should be "TRIANGLE" because the '1's form an upside-down triangle.
- However, the program will count the '1's in each row: `[1, 3, 1]`. Since `k[0] != k[1]`, it will not print anything, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly identify whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle for various cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
