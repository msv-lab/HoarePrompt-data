To determine the state adjustments required for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):
```

The variables involved here are `i`, `nums`, and implicitly `len(nums)`. The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value for `i`. This means `len(nums) - 2` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Let's break it down:

1. **`nums`**: The length of `nums` must be at least 3 for `len(nums) - 2` to be greater than or equal to 0. This ensures that the range function will generate at least one value for `i`.
2. **`i`**: The initial value of `i` will be `len(nums) - 2` and it will decrement by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1 (inclusive). Therefore, no specific initial value of `i` needs to be set before the loop starts, as it is controlled by the range function.
3. **`len(nums)`**: This is derived from the length of `nums`, so we just need to ensure that `nums` has at least 3 elements.

The other variables (`N`, `ls`, `nw`, `cw`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the required state adjustment is:

State: **`N` is unchanged, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ls` is the last element of the original sorted list, `nw` is `True`, `cw` is `True`**
