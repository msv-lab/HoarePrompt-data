The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ls` to `0`. This does not affect the values of `N` or `nums`. Therefore, the output state remains with `N` holding the value of the first integer read from the input and `nums` being a sorted list of integers derived from the first line of input, including the integer `0`. The variable `ls` is now `0`.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the first line of input split by spaces, including the integer `0`, and `ls` is `0`.**
