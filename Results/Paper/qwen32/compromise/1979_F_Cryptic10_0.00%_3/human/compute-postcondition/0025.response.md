The code appends the value of `v` to the `path` list. The other variables, `n`, `d`, `u`, `remaining_vertices`, and the condition for `v` being in `remaining_vertices`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is decreased by 1 from its current value; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; If `v` was initially 0, `d` is set to `n - 2`; If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v` as its last element, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v`; If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains unchanged and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged; `path` now includes `v` as its last element.**
