The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_1(d)` to the variables `v` and `u`. The initial state of `d` is described as `d + 1`, which implies that `d` has already been incremented by 1 before the function call. The function `func_1` is not defined, so we can't determine the exact values returned by the function, but we can denote them as `v` and `u`.

Therefore, after the execution of the code, the output state will include the new values of `v` and `u` as returned by `func_1(d)`, and `d` remains `d + 1`.

Output State: **`d` is `d + 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
