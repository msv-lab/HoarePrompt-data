To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the line `v, u = func_1(d)`. Given the initial state, we know the values of `n`, `v`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, and `d` (when `v` is 0).

Since the function `func_1(d)` is not defined in the initial state, we can't determine the exact values of `v` and `u` directly. However, we can describe the output state in terms of what `v` and `u` will be after the function call.

**Output State:**
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`.
- If `v` was initially 0, `d` is `n - 2`.
- `path` is a list containing the value of `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it remains an empty list.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n.

In natural language: The values of `v` and `u` are now the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The value of `d` is `n - 2` if `v` was initially 0. The `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged unless `v` changes and is in `remaining_vertices`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; if `v` was initially 0, `d` is `n - 2`; `path` is a list containing the value of `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it remains an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n.**
