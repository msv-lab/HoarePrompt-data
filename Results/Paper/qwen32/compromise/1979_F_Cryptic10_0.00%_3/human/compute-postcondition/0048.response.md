Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex, and optionally `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` now also includes `v` and `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, there is no change to `path` and `remaining_vertices`. The loop or conditional structure is exited.**
