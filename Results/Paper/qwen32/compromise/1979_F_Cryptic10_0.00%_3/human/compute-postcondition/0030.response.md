The `while` loop continues to execute as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `remaining_vertices` still contains at least one element.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is a list containing one element, which is a vertex from the set of remaining vertices.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except the vertex in `path`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex. This means we should ensure that `remaining_vertices` is not empty.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, we can adjust it to ensure it contains at least one element. We don't need to adjust `n` or `path` as they are not part of the loop condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing one element, which is a vertex from the set of remaining vertices; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex.**
