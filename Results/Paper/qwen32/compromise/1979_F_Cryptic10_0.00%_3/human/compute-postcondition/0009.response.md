The code appends the value of `v` to the `path` list. Therefore, `path` is no longer empty but contains the value of `v` as its first element. The `remaining_vertices` set remains unchanged except that it still does not contain `v` since `v` is already in `path` and was previously in `remaining_vertices`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the value of `v`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, then the current value of `v` remains 0. The current value of `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (before the code execution).**
