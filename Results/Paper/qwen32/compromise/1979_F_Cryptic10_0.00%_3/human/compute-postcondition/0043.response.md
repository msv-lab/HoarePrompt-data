Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing one or two elements, the original vertex, and optionally `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is no longer in the set; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values.
