The code `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the value `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. 

Given the initial state, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v`. After the execution of the line of code, `v` will no longer be part of `remaining_vertices`.

The other variables (`n`, `d`, `u`, `path`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is decreased by 1 from its current value; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; If `v` was initially 0, `d` is set to `n - 2`; `path` is a list containing the value of `v` as its last element; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v` and `v` itself has been removed from `remaining_vertices`.**
