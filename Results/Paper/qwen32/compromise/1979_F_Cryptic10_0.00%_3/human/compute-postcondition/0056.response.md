Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is now also in `path`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is no longer in the set; `d` is now `d - 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
