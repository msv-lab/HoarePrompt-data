Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and now also `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex except `v`; `d` is now `d - 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, no additional changes are made to the variables.**

In simpler terms, the vertex `v` has been removed from the `remaining_vertices` set. All other variables retain their previous values, except `remaining_vertices` which no longer includes `v`.
