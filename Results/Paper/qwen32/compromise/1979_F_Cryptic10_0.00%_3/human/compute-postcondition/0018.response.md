Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`; if `v` was initially 0, `d` is `n - 2`; `path` is a list containing the value of `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains the value of `v` as its last element; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v`.**

Explanation: The value of `v` is removed from the set `remaining_vertices`. The values of `n`, `v`, `u`, `d`, and `path` remain unchanged.
