The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `f`, and `k`. The initial state indicates that `n`, `f`, and `k` are already defined, but the code snippet will overwrite these values with new input values. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `same_value_count`, `greater_count`, and `_`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `same_value_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`, `greater_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `_` is incremented by 1.**
