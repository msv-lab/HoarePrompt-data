Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least `len(a)` elements. `n`, `f`, `k`, `t`, and `favorite_value` remain unchanged. `same_value_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`. `greater_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. The current value of `greater_count` plus `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`.**
