Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements. `n`, `f`, `k`, `t`, and `favorite_value` remain unchanged. `same_value_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`. If `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, `greater_count` is increased by 1. `value` is the next element in the list `a`.**
