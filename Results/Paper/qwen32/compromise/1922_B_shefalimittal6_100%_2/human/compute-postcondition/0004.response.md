Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from the first element of `data`; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 <= a_i <= n; `input` is a string containing all the input data; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace; `idx` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
