Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer obtained from the first element of `data`; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 <= a_i <= n; `input` is a string containing all the input data; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace; `idx` is 1; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    for _ in range(n):
        x = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v[x] += 1
    cnt = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if v[i] >= 2:
            ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
        if v[i] >= 3:
            ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
        cnt += v[i]
    results.append(str(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `v[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v`, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of certain combinations based on the counts in `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is 4, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is 11, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` followed by the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of 5 integers where each element is incremented based on the values of `x` read from `data`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, and `ans` is updated based on the values in `v` according to the conditions given in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer greater than 0; `n` remains a non-negative integer; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n; `input` remains a string containing all the input data; `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace; `idx` remains `12 + n`; `results` is a list containing three elements, all of which are the string representation of `ans`; `v` remains a list of `n + 1` integers; `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`; `ans` remains incremented by the appropriate values based on the formulas for each `v[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
