The code snippet `x = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `x` to the integer value of `data[idx]`. Given that `idx` is 3, `x` will now be the integer value of `data[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers with `v[x]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[3]`.**
