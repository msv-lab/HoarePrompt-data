Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from the first element of `data`; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 <= a_i <= n; `input` is a string containing all the input data; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace; `idx` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `input`, `data`, `idx`) remain unchanged.
