The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `v` by 1. Given the initial state, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers initialized to 0. After executing the code, the value at index `x` in `v` will be 1 (since it was 0 before and is incremented by 1).

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers with `v[x]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`.**
