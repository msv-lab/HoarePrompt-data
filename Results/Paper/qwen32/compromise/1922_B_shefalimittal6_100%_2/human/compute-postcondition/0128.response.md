The code snippet provided is:
```python
results.append(str(ans))
```

This code appends the string representation of `ans` to the `results` list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains an integer greater than 0.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n.
- `input` remains a string containing all the input data.
- `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace.
- `idx` remains `12 + n`.
- `results` remains a list containing the string representation of `ans` followed by the string representation of `ans`.
- `v` remains a list of `n + 1` integers.
- `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`.
- `ans` is incremented by the appropriate values based on the formulas for each `v[i]`.

After executing the code, `results` will have an additional element, which is the string representation of `ans`. Therefore, the `results` list will now have three elements: the original two string representations of `ans` followed by the new string representation of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer greater than 0; `n` remains a non-negative integer; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n; `input` remains a string containing all the input data; `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace; `idx` remains `12 + n`; `results` is a list containing three elements, all of which are the string representation of `ans`; `v` remains a list of `n + 1` integers; `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`; `ans` remains incremented by the appropriate values based on the formulas for each `v[i]`.**
