The provided code snippet appends the string representation of `ans` to the `results` list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx`, `v`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is 4, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is 11, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` followed by the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of 5 integers where each element is incremented based on the values of `x` read from `data`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, and `ans` is updated based on the values in `v` according to the conditions given in the loop.**
