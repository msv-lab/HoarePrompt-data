The code snippet provided only increments the value of `idx` by 1. Therefore, the value of `idx` will change from 11 to 12. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[11]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is 12, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` followed by the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of 5 integers where each element is incremented based on the values of `x` read from `data`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, and `ans` is updated based on the values in `v` according to the conditions given in the loop.**
