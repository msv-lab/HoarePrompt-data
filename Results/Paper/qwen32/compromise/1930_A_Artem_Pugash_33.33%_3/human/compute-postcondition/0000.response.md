The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numCases`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, and for each test case, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^7. The only variable that changes after executing the given code is `numCases`, which is set to the integer read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `numCases` is the integer read from the input; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**
