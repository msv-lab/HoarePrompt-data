Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` remains greater than 0, For each test case, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` remains a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `numInteger` is the input integer, `numbers` becomes a sorted list of strings from the input in ascending order, `suma` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
while numbers != []:
    a = int(numbers.pop(0))
    b = int(numbers.pop(0))
    suma += min(a, b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` remains greater than 0, For each test case, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was initially popped from `numbers`, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings (excluding the first two elements), `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was popped from `numbers`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` remains greater than 0, For each test case, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the element that was just popped from `numbers`, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings (excluding the first two elements) with one less element, `suma` is `min(a, b) + min(a, b)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is the integer value of the first element that was popped from `numbers`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` remains greater than 0, For each test case, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the new first element that was popped from `numbers`, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings (excluding the first two elements) with one less element, `suma` is `min(a, b) + min(a, b) + min(a, b)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is the integer value of the new first element that was popped from `numbers`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
