Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` remains greater than 0, For each test case, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the new first element that was popped from `numbers`, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings (excluding the first two elements) with one less element, `suma` is `min(a, b) + min(a, b) + min(a, b)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is the integer value of the new first element that was popped from `numbers`.**

Explanation: The value of `suma` is updated to include an additional `min(a, b)`, making it the sum of three minimum values between `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged in terms of their descriptions and constraints.
