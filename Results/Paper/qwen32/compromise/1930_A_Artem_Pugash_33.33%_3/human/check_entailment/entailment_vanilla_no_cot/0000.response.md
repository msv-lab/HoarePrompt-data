Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. It then iteratively picks pairs of integers from the sorted list, always picking the smallest available integers first (which are at the beginning of the sorted list).
5. It adds the minimum of each pair to the score.
6. Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

Since the list is sorted in ascending order, the smallest element of each pair is always chosen, ensuring that the sum of the minimums is maximized. This approach guarantees the optimal solution for the problem.
