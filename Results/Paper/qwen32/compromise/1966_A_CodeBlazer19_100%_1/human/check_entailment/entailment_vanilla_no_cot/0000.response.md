Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks if the maximum count of any single card number is greater than or equal to `k` and then returns `k-1` or `n` based on that condition. However, the correct approach involves a more nuanced calculation based on the counts of each card number.

Here's a brief explanation of the correct approach:

1. Count the occurrences of each card number.
2. For each distinct card number, calculate how many cards will remain after repeatedly performing the operation: if there are `x` cards with the same number, you can reduce the count by `k` and increase it by `k-1` until you can't perform the operation anymore. The final count for that card number will be `x % (k-1)` if `x % (k-1) != 0`, otherwise it would be `k-1` (but since we can't have more cards than we started with, it will be 0 if `x % (k-1) == 0` and `x % (k-1)` otherwise).
3. Sum these final counts for all card numbers to get the minimum number of cards left.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        result = sum(x % (k - 1) if x % (k - 1) != 0 else 0 for x in p)
        print(result if result != 0 else n % (k - 1))

func()
```

This corrected version handles the problem as described and should produce the correct output for the given examples and other test cases.
