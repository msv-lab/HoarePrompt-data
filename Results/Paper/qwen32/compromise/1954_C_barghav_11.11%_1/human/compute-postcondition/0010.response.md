The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but operates based on `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`. The constraints are that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, with both `x` and `y` consisting only of digits from 1 to 9.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y`. It returns the result for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.**
