You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: t remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, the values of a, b, and c are not defined outside the loop as they are re-assigned in each iteration; q remains the same input integer. The output consists of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' printed for each of the q iterations based on the conditions evaluated within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `q` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` each ranging from 0 to 9. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided Python program is designed to evaluate each test case based on the given conditions for a "stair" and a "peak". Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. The program first reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, where each iteration corresponds to one test case.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
4. It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "stair". If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
5. If the first condition is not met, it checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a "peak". If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
6. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The conditions and the flow of the program are correctly implemented according to the problem description. The program will correctly identify whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
