The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `q`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `q` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute. If `q` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, `q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
