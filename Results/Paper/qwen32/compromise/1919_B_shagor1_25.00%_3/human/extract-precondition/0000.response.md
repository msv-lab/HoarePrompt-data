Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string s. The second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-'. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. There are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.**
