Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of a string `s`. The string `s` consists of characters '+' and '-' and has a length of `n`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the content of the string `s`.**
