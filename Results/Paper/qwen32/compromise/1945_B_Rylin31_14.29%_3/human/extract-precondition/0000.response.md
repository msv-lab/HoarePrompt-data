Precondition: **Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18), where a and b represent the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and m represents the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing three integers a, b, and m for each test case.**
