The code snippet provided only reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the input. This means that the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case are not yet read or processed. The only change in the state is that the variable `t` is assigned the integer value read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not yet assigned values.**
