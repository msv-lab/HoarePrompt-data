In the given for loop, the loop variable is `i`, and it iterates from `0` to `t` with a step of `1`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than `0` because the range function generates numbers starting from `0` up to, but not including, `t`. 

The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned in the precondition for each test case, but they are not directly part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states to ensure the loop executes. They will be used inside the loop body, which is omitted here.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be greater than `0`. The initial value of `i` does not need to be adjusted since the range function initializes it to `0` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
