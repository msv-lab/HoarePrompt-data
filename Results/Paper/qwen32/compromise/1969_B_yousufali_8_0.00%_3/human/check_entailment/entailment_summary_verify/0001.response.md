### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the code based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summaries.

#### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings with the minimum total cost. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r-l+1` is `r-l+1`.

#### Code Analysis:
- `func_1` is intended to compute the minimum cost for a single binary string.
- `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

#### Issues in `func_1`:
1. **Input Handling**: The line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect. `input().split()` splits the input by whitespace, which is not appropriate for reading a string without spaces. Instead, `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` should be used to read a line and convert each character to an integer.
2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The current implementation counts the number of 1s encountered before a 0 and adds `n+1` to the answer, where `n` is the count of 1s. This does not correctly simulate the cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine the minimum cost to sort the string by cyclic shifts. Here is a high-level outline of the correct approach:
1. Traverse the string and identify segments of 1s and 0s.
2. Calculate the cost of converting each segment into a sorted sequence by cyclic shifts.
3. Sum up the costs for all segments.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: The current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it uses `input().split()`, which is not suitable for reading a binary string without spaces. This should be corrected to `input().strip()` to read the entire string and then convert each character to an integer.
- **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string. The correct approach involves identifying transitions from 1 to 0 and calculating the cost based on the number of such transitions and the positions of 1s and 0s.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary for `func_2` is accurate: it prompts the user to input an integer `t` and then calls `func_1` a total of `t` times.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues in the provided code. The input handling and the logic for cost calculation are both flawed. Thus, the final evaluation is **False**.
