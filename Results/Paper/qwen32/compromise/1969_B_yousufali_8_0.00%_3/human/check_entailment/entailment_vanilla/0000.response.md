Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) is \( r - l + 1 \).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- It reads a binary string as a list of integers.
- It initializes `n` (count of 1s encountered) and `ans` (total cost).
- It iterates through the string:
  - If the current character is 1, it increments `n`.
  - If the current character is 0 and `n` (number of 1s encountered so far) is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
- It prints the total cost `ans`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

### Correctness Analysis:
Let's verify if the logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the count of 1s encountered so far.
   - `ans` accumulates the total cost.

2. **Logic**:
   - When a 1 is encountered, `n` is incremented.
   - When a 0 is encountered and `n` is not zero, it means there are `n` 1s before this 0. To bring these `n` 1s after this 0, the cost is `n + 1` (since we need to cyclically shift the substring that includes these `n` 1s and the 0).

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost `n + 1` is added each time a 0 is encountered after some 1s. This is because each 0 after some 1s contributes to the cost of shifting those 1s to the right of the 0.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider the example given in the problem:

- **Input**: `10`
  - `n` = 1 (after reading the first '1')
  - `ans` = 1 + 1 = 2 (after reading the '0')
  - **Output**: `2`

- **Input**: `0000`
  - `n` = 0 (no 1s)
  - `ans` = 0 (no 0s after any 1s)
  - **Output**: `0`

- **Input**: `11000`
  - `n` = 2 (after reading the first two '1's)
  - `ans` = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9 (after reading the '0's)
  - **Output**: `9`

The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

**Correctness: True**
