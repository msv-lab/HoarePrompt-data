Reasoning:
The function `func_1()` is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads the time in 24-hour format as a string `s` of length 5.
3. It extracts the hour part `h` from the string `s` (the first two characters).
4. It then checks the value of `h`:
   - If `h` is '00', it prints '12' (midnight in 12-hour format).
   - If `h` is between '01' and '12', it prints `h` as is (since these hours are the same in 12-hour format).
   - If `h` is greater than '12', it converts it to the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 and prints it with a leading zero if necessary.
5. The function appends the minutes part `s[2:]` directly to the hour part.
6. It determines whether to append 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`:
   - If `h` is '12' or greater, it appends 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'AM'.

The function correctly handles the conversion of hours and minutes, and it also correctly appends the appropriate AM/PM suffix. The function also ensures that the hour part is always two digits by adding a leading zero when necessary for hours between 1 and 9 in the 12-hour format.

The example provided in the problem description matches the output generated by the function, which further confirms the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
