### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the program step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find all possible values of `k` such that the `n`-th person in a line receives the number `x` when the line is settled in a specific pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - The pattern for `k` is: `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, k-2, ..., 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., k, ...`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the `n`-th person receives the number `x`, then `n` must be in a position that corresponds to `x` in the repeating pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, so we need to find `k` such that `n` modulo `2k - 2` corresponds to `x` or `2k - x + 2`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
   - It then checks two conditions based on the equations derived from the pattern:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`: This condition checks if `n + x - 2` is even.
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`: This condition checks if `n - x` is even.
   - If these conditions are met, it calculates the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` using the function `func_1`.
   - It then checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each divisor `s` to determine valid `k` values.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique valid `k` values.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It returns a list of divisors in a specific order, which is not crucial for the correctness of the solution as long as all divisors are included.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the conditions under which `n` and `x` can match the pattern for different `k` values.
   - It uses the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` to find potential `k` values.
   - It ensures that `k` is at least `x` and that the pattern fits the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the possible values of `k` by leveraging the properties of the pattern and the divisors of the relevant expressions.

**Correctness: True**
