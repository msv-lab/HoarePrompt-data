Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that cause it not to work as expected according to the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Undefined Function**: The function `func_1` is used but not defined in the provided code. This will cause a `NameError` when the code is executed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `k` Values**:
   - The logic for calculating `k` values is incorrect. The program attempts to find divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`, but this does not align with the problem description. The problem requires finding `k` such that the position `n` and number `x` fit the described pattern.
   - The formula `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` does not help in determining the correct `k` values. The pattern described in the problem involves a repeating sequence of length `2k - 2`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle edge cases or ensure that `k` is greater than 1.
   - The logic for checking `k` values is flawed, and it does not correctly account for the periodic nature of the sequence.

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
Input:
```
1
10 2
```
Expected Output:
```
4
```
Explanation:
- For `k = 2`, the sequence is `1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2`.
- For `k = 3`, the sequence is `1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2`.
- For `k = 5`, the sequence is `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2`.
- For `k = 6`, the sequence is `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2`.

The provided program does not correctly identify these `k` values.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, so the correctness is **False**.
