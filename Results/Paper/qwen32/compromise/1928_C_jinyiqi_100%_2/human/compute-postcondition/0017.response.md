Output State: **The program returns a list that combines `output2` and `output1`. `output2` contains all divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order.**

To clarify, the returned list is a concatenation of `output2` and the reversed `output1`, effectively providing all divisors of `x` in ascending order.
