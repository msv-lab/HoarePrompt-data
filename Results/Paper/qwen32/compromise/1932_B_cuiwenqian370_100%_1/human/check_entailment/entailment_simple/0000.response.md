### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify that it accurately computes the year in which the n-th sign occurs, according to the problem description. The program reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of the number of signs and their respective periodicities. For each test case, it calculates the year in which all signs occur in sequence.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case sequentially.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign (from the second to the n-th), it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs in a year that is a multiple of `a[i]` and strictly after `last_year`.

4. **Updating `last_year`:**
   - After calculating `next_year`, it updates `last_year` to `next_year`.

5. **Storing Results:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The provided example inputs and their corresponding outputs are correctly matched by the program. Here is a verification of the first test case:

- **Input:** `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Processing:**
  - First sign: `last_year = 3`
  - Second sign: `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign: `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign: `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign: `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign: `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
- **Output:** `36`

This matches the expected output, and similar verifications can be done for other test cases.

### Correctness:
Since the program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, and the outputs match the expected results, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
