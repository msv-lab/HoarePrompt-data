The code calculates the value of `next_year` based on the provided formula. Given the initial state, `n` must be greater than 1, but `n` is not used in the provided code snippet. The calculation for `next_year` involves `last_year`, `a`, and `i`. Since the specific values of `last_year`, `a`, and `i` are not provided, we will express `next_year` in terms of these variables.

The formula `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` simplifies to `next_year = (last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`. This means `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`**.
