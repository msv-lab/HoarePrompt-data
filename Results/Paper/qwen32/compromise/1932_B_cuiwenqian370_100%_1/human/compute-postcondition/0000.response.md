The provided code snippet only reads input from the standard input but does not process or store it in any variable. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The variable `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.read`, but no input is actually read or processed in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 100, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6. `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.read`.**
