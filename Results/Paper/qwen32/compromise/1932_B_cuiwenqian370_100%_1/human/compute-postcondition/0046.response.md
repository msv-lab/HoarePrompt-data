The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range it iterates over, which is defined by `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. 

Let's break down the provided state and see which parts can be adjusted:
- `t` is unchanged: This does not affect the loop's execution.
- `results` includes `str(last_year)` as its last element and now also includes another `str(last_year)` as its new last element: This does not affect the loop's execution.
- `T` is still greater than the current number of iterations: This does not affect the loop's execution.
- `n` is `int(data[index - n])`: This defines the range of the loop. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.
- `index` is incremented by `n`: This does not affect the loop's execution directly.
- `a` is derived from `data[index - n:index]` and now contains the integers from `data[index - n:index]`: This does not affect the loop's execution directly.
- `last_year` is `a[0]`: This does not affect the loop's execution directly.
- `_` is incremented by 1: This does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Given the loop head `for i in range(1, n):`, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n`. It must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
