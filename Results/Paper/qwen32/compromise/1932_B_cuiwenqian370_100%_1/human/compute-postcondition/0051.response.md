Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `next_year` is `((last_year + a[i]) // a[i]) * a[i]`; `last_year` is `next_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`, `i` has been incremented by 1, `next_year` is calculated as `((last_year + a[i]) // a[i]) * a[i]`, and `last_year` is now equal to `next_year`.
