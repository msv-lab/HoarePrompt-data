The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. This means `n` is now an integer representation of the element in the `data` list at the position specified by `index`. The values of `t`, `results`, and the precondition that `T` must be greater than the current number of iterations remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `results` now includes `str(last_year)` as its last element, `T` must be greater than the current number of iterations, `n` is `int(data[index])`.**
