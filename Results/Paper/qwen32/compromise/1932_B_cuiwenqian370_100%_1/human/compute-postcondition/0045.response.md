The code assigns the value of the first element of the list `a` to the variable `last_year`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `results` includes `str(last_year)` as its last element and now also includes another `str(last_year)` as its new last element; `T` is still greater than the current number of iterations; `n` is `int(data[index - n])`; `index` is incremented by `n`; `a` is derived from `data[index - n:index]` and now contains the integers from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is `a[0]`; `_` is incremented by 1.**
