The value of `last_year` is updated to be equal to `next_year`. The values of `n`, `i`, and the expression for `next_year` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`, and `last_year` is now equal to `next_year`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`**.
