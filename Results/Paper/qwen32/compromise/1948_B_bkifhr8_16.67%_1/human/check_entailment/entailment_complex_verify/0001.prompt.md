You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the length of lst, n, satisfies 2 <= n <= 50. Additionally, the function will be called multiple times (t times) with each call receiving a separate list lst as described, where 1 <= t <= 10^3.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if the list `lst` is already sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if a given list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 and the list length is between 2 and 50, is sorted in non-decreasing order. It returns `True` if the list is sorted, otherwise it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the length of the array, and then reads the array itself.

2. **Transformation Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is less than the previous one and the previous element is at least 10, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array at the same position.
   - However, the logic to check if the previous element should be split is incorrect. The condition `list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10` is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements. This condition only checks if the current element is smaller than the previous one and if the previous one is at least 10. It does not ensure that splitting the previous element will help in sorting the array.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After attempting to transform the array, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function simply checks if the array is equal to its sorted version.

### Issues:
- The main issue with the program is the logic used to decide when to split an element. The program only splits an element if it is greater than the next element and is at least 10, which is not a sufficient condition to ensure the array can be sorted by splitting.
- The program does not consider other possible ways to split elements to achieve a sorted array.
- The program does not handle cases where multiple splits might be necessary to sort the array.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
