The code calculates two values based on the input `k`: `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2`, and `b` is the floor of `k / 2`. Given that `k` is an integer, `b` is simply `k // 2`, and `a` is `b` if `k` is even, or `b + 1` if `k` is odd. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of `nums`; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`.**
