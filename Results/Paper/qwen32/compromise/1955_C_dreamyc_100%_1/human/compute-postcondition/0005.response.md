The code snippet initializes `s_a` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, and `ans`) are not affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of `nums`; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`; `ans` is 0; `s_a` is 0.**
