### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.

Let's break down the condition given in the program:
- **Condition**: `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0`
  - **`n >= m`**: This ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the number of cubes we want to end up with. This makes sense because we can't end up with more cubes than the number of moves if we can only add one cube per move.
  - **`(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This condition ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even. This is because each time we add a cube, we are essentially increasing the count by 1, and each time we remove a cube, we are decreasing the count by 1. To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of additions and subtractions must balance out in a way that results in an even difference between `n` and `m`.

### Verification with Examples:
1. **First Test Case**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is `3 >= 3` which is `True`.
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` which is `True`.
   - **Result**: `YES` (Correct as per the problem statement).

2. **Second Test Case**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - `n >= m` is `2 >= 4` which is `False`.
   - Since the first condition is `False`, the program directly outputs `NO` without checking the second condition.
   - **Result**: `NO` (Correct as per the problem statement).

3. **Third Test Case**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is `5 >= 3` which is `True`.
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` which is `True`.
   - **Result**: `YES` (Correct as per the problem statement).

### Conclusion:
The logic in the provided program correctly implements the conditions necessary to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
