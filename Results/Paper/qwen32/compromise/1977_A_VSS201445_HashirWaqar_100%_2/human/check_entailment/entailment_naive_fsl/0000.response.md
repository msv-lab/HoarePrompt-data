Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it does not account for the scenario where the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`. In such a case, it is impossible for Nikita to build a tower with `m` cubes because he can only add or remove one cube at a time. The current logic only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even, which is not sufficient.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 3
```
In this case, `n = 2` and `m = 3`. It is impossible for Nikita to end up with 3 cubes after only 2 moves, regardless of whether he adds or removes cubes. The program should output "No" for this case, but the current logic will output "YES" because `(n - m) % 2 == -1 % 2 == 1`, which is not checked correctly.

A correct implementation should account for the possibility that `n` is less than `m` and output "No" in such cases. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Corrected version
def func_corrected():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif n < m:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example of the corrected version handling the problematic case
# Input: 1\n2 3
# Output: NO
```

Thus, the original program is incorrect due to the missing check for `n < m`.
