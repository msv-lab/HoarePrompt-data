Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of integers where the first integer `t` represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `m`, and the second line contains `n` integers. The function returns the number of trailing '0's in the factorial of `m` for each test case.**
