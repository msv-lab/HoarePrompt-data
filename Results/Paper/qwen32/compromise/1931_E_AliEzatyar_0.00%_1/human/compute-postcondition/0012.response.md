The code snippet `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. The initial state specifies that `num` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `i` is incremented by 1. Since the code only affects `counter`, the values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1, `counter` is incremented by 1.**
