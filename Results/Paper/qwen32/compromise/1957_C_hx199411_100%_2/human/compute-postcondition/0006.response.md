The code snippet reads two integers from the input, separated by a space, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space, and `k` must be greater than 0; `num` is 0; `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, where `c` is the first integer and `r` is the second integer separated by a space.**
