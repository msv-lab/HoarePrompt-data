The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 5. Since `m` is at least 3, `m + 1` is at least 4, which is less than 5, so `m` must be at least 5 to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the sum of increments from all iterations (either 1 or 2 per iteration), `m` is at least 5, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25, `i` is 5**
