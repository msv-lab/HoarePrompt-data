The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `m`), but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly given by the code itself.

Let's break down the given information to ensure clarity:

- `t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space.
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`.
- `i` is equal to `k`.
- `m` is equal to `n - num`.
- The current value of `m` is 0.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `m`) are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **1**
