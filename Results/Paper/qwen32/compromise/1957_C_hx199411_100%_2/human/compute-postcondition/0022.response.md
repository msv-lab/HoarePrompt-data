To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how `num` changes with each iteration and the total number of iterations `k`.

Given:
- `num` starts at 0.
- For each iteration, if `c == r`, `num` increases by 1; otherwise, `num` increases by 2.
- The loop runs `k` times.

Let's break down the changes:
- After 1 iteration: `num` is either 1 or 2.
- After 2 iterations: `num` is either 2, 3, 4, or 5 (depending on the values of `c` and `r` in each iteration).
- After 3 iterations: `num` is either 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.

Following this pattern, after `k` iterations, `num` will be the sum of the increments from each iteration. If `c == r` for all `k` iterations, `num` will be `k`. If `c != r` for all `k` iterations, `num` will be `2k`. The actual value of `num` will be somewhere between `k` and `2k`, depending on how many times `c == r`.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is equal to `k`.**

In simpler terms, `num` will be the total count of 1s and 2s added based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations.
