The value of `num` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `num` is 0, so after the operation, `num` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space, and `k` must be greater than 0; `num` is 2; `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, where `c` is the first integer and `r` is the second integer separated by a space; `c` is not equal to `r`.**
