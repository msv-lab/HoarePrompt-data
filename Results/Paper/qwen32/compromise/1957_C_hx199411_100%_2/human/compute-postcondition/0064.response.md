To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

### Analysis of the Loop:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `t` is 0.
  - `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
  - `num` is 0.
  - `m` is calculated as `n - num`.

- **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `k` times, where `k` is the second integer input.

- **Loop Body**:
  - For each iteration, two integers `c` and `r` are read from the input.
  - If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is incremented by 1.
  - Otherwise, `num` is incremented by 2.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- **Loop Completion**: After `k` iterations, the loop will have processed `k` pairs of integers (`c`, `r`).
- **Final Value of `num`**: The value of `num` will be the sum of the increments from each iteration. Each iteration either adds 1 or 2 to `num`, depending on whether `c` equals `r`.
- **Final Value of `m`**: Since `m` is calculated as `n - num` and `num` changes with each iteration, the final value of `m` will be `n` minus the total number of increments to `num` over the `k` iterations.
- **Other Variables**: The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

### Conclusion:
- **`t`**: Remains 0.
- **`n`**: Remains the same as the input.
- **`k`**: Remains the same as the input.
- **`num`**: The final value of `num` is the sum of all increments over `k` iterations.
- **`m`**: The final value of `m` is `n - num`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the sum of increments from all iterations (either 1 or 2 per iteration), and `m` is `n - num`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes all its iterations, `t` stays 0, `n` and `k` remain as they were input, `num` is the total count of increments (1 for each match and 2 for each mismatch), and `m` is recalculated as the difference between `n` and `num`.
