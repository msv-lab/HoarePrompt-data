The code snippet `dp[2] = 3` sets the value of the second element in the list `dp` to 3. All other variables and their values remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.**
