To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the logic that constructs the `dp` list.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is initialized to 0.
2. `n` and `k` are integers obtained from input.
3. `num` is the total increment based on `c` and `r` values (these values are not provided, so we assume `num` is some calculated value).
4. `m` is defined as `n - num` and must be at least 3.
5. `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with:
   - `dp[1]` initialized to 1.
   - `dp[2]` initialized to 3.
   - The rest of the elements (`dp[3]` to `dp[m]`) are calculated using a loop formula (the specific formula is not provided, so we assume it is some defined loop that fills in the values).

### Analysis:
- The `dp` list is initialized with specific values for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`.
- The values for `dp[3]` to `dp[m]` are calculated using a loop, but the exact formula is not provided, so we can only describe the value of `dp[m]` in terms of the loop's computation.

### Output Description:
Since the loop formula is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `dp[m]`. However, we can describe it as the value computed by the loop for the index `m`.

### Final Output:
Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value computed by the loop for the index m)**
