Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 3 or 4, `m` is equal to `n - num`, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1**

Natural language: The value of `num` is increased by 2, so if `num` was initially 1, it is now 3, and if `num` was initially 2, it is now 4. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `r`, and the fact that `i` is incremented by 1 remain unchanged.
