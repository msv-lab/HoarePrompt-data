The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Initially, `num` is 0, so after the operation, `num` becomes 1. The value of `m` is initially `n - num`, and since `num` has changed from 0 to 1, `m` now becomes `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 1, `m` is `n - 1`, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, and `c` is equal to `r`.**
