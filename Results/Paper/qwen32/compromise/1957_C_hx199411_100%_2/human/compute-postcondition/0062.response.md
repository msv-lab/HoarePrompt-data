Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 4 or 5 or 6, `m` is equal to `n - num`, `c` and `r` are new integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 2, so if `num` was initially 2, it becomes 4; if `num` was initially 3, it becomes 5; and if `num` was initially 4, it becomes 6. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
