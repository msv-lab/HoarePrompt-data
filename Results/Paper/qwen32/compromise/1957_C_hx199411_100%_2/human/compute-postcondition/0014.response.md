Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space, and `k` must be greater than 0; `c` and `r` are new integers obtained from the latest input, where `c` is the first integer and `r` is the second integer separated by a space; `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 3; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1. If `c` equals `r`, `num` was initially 1 and becomes 2. If `c` does not equal `r`, `num` was initially 2 and becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
