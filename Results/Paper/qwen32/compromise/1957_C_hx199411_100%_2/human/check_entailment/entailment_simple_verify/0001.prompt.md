You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6

    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a game played on an n x n chessboard where players take turns placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other (i.e., no two rooks share the same row or column). The player starts by placing a white rook, and the computer mirrors this move by placing a black rook at the mirrored position, unless the rook is placed on the diagonal (r = c), in which case the computer skips its turn. After k moves (both player and computer moves), the task is to determine the number of possible final configurations of the board modulo 10^9+7.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Initial Moves:** The first k moves are given, and the computer mirrors these moves unless the move is on the diagonal.
2. **Remaining Moves:** After k moves, the game continues until no valid moves are left.
3. **Configuration Counting:** The number of possible configurations is to be counted, considering the constraints of rook placement.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
2. **Counting Moves on the Diagonal:** The program counts how many of the initial moves are on the diagonal (`num += 1`) and how many are off the diagonal (`num += 2`), because for off-diagonal moves, both the player and the computer make a move.
3. **Remaining Empty Positions:** The remaining positions on the board that can be used for further moves are calculated as `m = n - num`.
4. **Base Cases:** If `m` is 0 or 1, the number of configurations is 1 (since no more moves can be made).
5. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program uses a dynamic programming array `dp` to calculate the number of configurations for `m` remaining positions.
   - The base cases are set as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which calculates the number of configurations for `i` remaining positions based on the previous configurations.

### Correctness of the DP Formula:
The DP formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is derived from the fact that for `i` remaining positions:
- One configuration is where the player places a rook in one of the `i` positions, and the computer mirrors it (resulting in `dp[i - 2]` configurations for the remaining positions).
- Another configuration is where the player places a rook on the diagonal, which does not get mirrored, resulting in `dp[i - 1]` configurations for the remaining positions.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of possible final configurations of the board after k moves, using dynamic programming to handle the remaining positions efficiently. Therefore, the program is correct.
