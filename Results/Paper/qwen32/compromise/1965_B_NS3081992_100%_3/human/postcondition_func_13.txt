The function determines two integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_7()`. It then constructs and returns a string based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 1, it returns '1\n2' if `n` is 2, otherwise it returns a string starting with '2\n' followed by the numbers 2 and 3, and then powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is not 1, it returns a string starting with '5\n' followed by the numbers 2, `k-1` minus the sum of powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`, `k+1`, `2*k+1`, and powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
