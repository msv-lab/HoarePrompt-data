Let's analyze the given loop and its effect on the state of the variables.

The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = lk - 2` (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the stop value). During each iteration, it calculates `2 ** i` and appends this value to the list `ans`.

Given that `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`, the loop will run `lk - 1` times. The values appended to `ans` will be `2 ** 0, 2 ** 1, 2 ** 2, ..., 2 ** (lk - 2)`.

Thus, the final state of `ans` will be a list containing these powers of 2.

Output State: **ans is a list containing [2 ** 0, 2 ** 1, 2 ** 2, ..., 2 ** (lk - 2)], n, k, b, l, bk, lk remain unchanged.**
