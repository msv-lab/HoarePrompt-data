The code snippet calculates the length of the binary representation of `k` and assigns it to the variable `lk`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string, `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`, `k` is not equal to 1, and `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string; `ans` is an empty list; `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`**.
