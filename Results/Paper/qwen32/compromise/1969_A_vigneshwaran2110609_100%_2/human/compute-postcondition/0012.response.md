The given `print` statement is:

```python
print(2)
```

The value to be printed is explicitly specified in the `print` statement itself, and it does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `x`, `l`, `i`, `flag`) described in the initial state. The `print` statement will simply output the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
