Postcondition: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the total number of iterations, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, `flag` is set to `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains `False`.**
