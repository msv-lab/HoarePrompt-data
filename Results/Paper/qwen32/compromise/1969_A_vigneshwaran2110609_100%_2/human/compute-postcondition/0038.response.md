The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the total number of iterations, `x` is greater than `n`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `flag` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
