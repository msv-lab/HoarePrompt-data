The code snippet increments the value of `j` by 1. The initial value of `j` is 2, so after the operation, `j` becomes 3. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `a`, `b`) are not affected by this operation. The preconditions that `i` is incremented by 1, `m` must be greater than 2, and `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[i]` still hold.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than 2, `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**.
