The code snippet provided initializes the variable `j` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `j` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a binary string of length `n` read from input; `b` is a new binary string read from input; `k` is 0; `j` is 0.**
