The code increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` was equal to `m` and was less than `m`. After the increment, `j` will be equal to `m + 1`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is incremented by 1.**
