Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a binary string of length n read from input; `b` is a new binary string read from input where `b[0]` is the opposite of `a[0]`; `k` is 0; `j` is equal to `m` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged except that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
