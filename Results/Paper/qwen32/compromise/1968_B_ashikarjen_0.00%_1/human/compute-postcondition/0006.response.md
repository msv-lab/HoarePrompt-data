To determine which states need to be adjusted for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `j < m`
2. `b[j] != a[i]`

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a binary string of length `n` read from input
- `b` is a new binary string read from input
- `k` is 0
- `j` is 0

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. `j < m`: Since `j` is initially 0 and `m` is at least 1, this condition is already satisfied.
2. `b[j] != a[i]`: Here, `j` is 0, so we need to ensure that `b[0] != a[i]`. However, the value of `i` is not provided in the state, so we need to make sure that there exists at least one position `i` in the string `a` such that `b[0] != a[i]`.

Since `a` is a binary string (only contains '0' and '1'), and `b` is also a binary string, we need to ensure that the first character of `b` (`b[0]`) is different from the first character of `a` (`a[0]`), or if not, then it should be different from some other character in `a`.

To guarantee the loop executes, we can adjust `b` such that `b[0]` is different from `a[0]`. Since `a[0]` can be either '0' or '1', we can set `b[0]` to the opposite of `a[0]`.

Let's summarize the adjusted state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a binary string of length `n` read from input
- `b` is a new binary string read from input, where `b[0]` is the opposite of `a[0]`
- `k` is 0
- `j` is 0

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a binary string of length `n` read from input; `b` is a new binary string read from input where `b[0]` is the opposite of `a[0]`; `k` is 0; `j` is 0**
