The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `j` is an integer less than `m`, and since `j` is incremented, it remains an integer less than `m` unless it was initially `m-1`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a binary string of length `n` read from input; `b` is a new binary string read from input where `b[0]` is the opposite of `a[0]`; `k` is 1; `j` is an integer less than `m` and `j` is increased by 1.**
