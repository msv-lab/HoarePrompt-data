You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively, and calculates the maximum number of characters from `a` that can be matched in `b` in order, without reusing characters in `b`. It then prints this count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine the maximum possible number `k` such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. A sequence `a` is a subsequence of `b` if `a` can be obtained from `b` by deleting some elements (possibly none).

### Program Analysis
Here is the provided program:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
```

### Checking Correctness
The program reads the lengths of the strings `a` and `b`, then the strings themselves. It initializes `k` to count the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` and `j` to track the current position in `b`.

The program iterates over each character in `a` and tries to find it in `b` starting from the current position `j`. If it finds the character, it increments `k` and moves to the next character in `a` and the next position in `b`. If it cannot find the character, it breaks out of the loop and prints the current value of `k`.

### Edge Cases and Validation
Let's consider the provided examples and some additional edge cases to validate the program:

1. **Example 1:**
   ```
   Input:
   5 4
   10011
   1110
   
   Output:
   2
   ```
   The program correctly identifies '10' as the longest prefix of '10011' that is a subsequence of '1110'.

2. **Example 2:**
   ```
   Input:
   3 3
   100
   110
   
   Output:
   2
   ```
   The program correctly identifies '10' as the longest prefix of '100' that is a subsequence of '110'.

3. **Example 3:**
   ```
   Input:
   1 3
   1
   111
   
   Output:
   1
   ```
   The program correctly identifies '1' as the longest prefix of '1' that is a subsequence of '111'.

4. **Example 4:**
   ```
   Input:
   4 4
   1011
   1111
   
   Output:
   1
   ```
   The program correctly identifies '1' as the longest prefix of '1011' that is a subsequence of '1111'. However, this seems incorrect based on the problem description, as '101' should be identified as the longest prefix.

5. **Example 5:**
   ```
   Input:
   3 5
   100
   11010
   
   Output:
   3
   ```
   The program correctly identifies '100' as the longest prefix of '100' that is a subsequence of '11010'.

6. **Example 6:**
   ```
   Input:
   3 1
   100
   0
   
   Output:
   0
   ```
   The program correctly identifies that no prefix of '100' is a subsequence of '0'.

### Conclusion
The program seems to work correctly for the provided examples except for the fourth example where it incorrectly identifies the longest prefix. However, upon closer inspection, it seems the fourth example might have been misinterpreted in the problem description's expected output.

Given that the program correctly handles all other edge cases and examples provided, we can conclude that it meets the problem description's requirements for all potential cases.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number `k` such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. It iterates through each character of `a` and tries to find it in `b`, incrementing the count `k` whenever a match is found and moving to the next character in both strings. If a character in `a` cannot be found in `b`, it breaks out of the loop and returns the correct count `k`.
