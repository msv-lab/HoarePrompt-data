The code snippet `s1 += i` appends the character `i` to the string `s1`. Given the initial state, `s1` was initially an empty string. After appending `i`, `s1` will contain the single character `i`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `m` is the length of `s` and satisfies 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `s1` is the string containing the single character `i`, `s2` is an empty string if the length of `alphabet` is not equal to 1, otherwise `s2` is the string containing the single character `i`, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets except `i` if the length of `alphabet` is not equal to 1, otherwise `alphabet` includes all the first `k` lowercase English alphabets including `i`, and `i` is no longer in `alphabet` if the length of `alphabet` is not equal to 1, otherwise `i` is in `alphabet`.**
