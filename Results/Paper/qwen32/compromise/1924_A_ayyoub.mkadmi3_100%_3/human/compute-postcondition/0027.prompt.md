Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `m` is the length of `s` and satisfies 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `s1` is an empty string, `s2` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in alphabet:
        if len(alphabet) != 1:
            alphabet.remove(i)
        else:
            s2 += i
            alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
        s1 += i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `m` is the length of `s` and satisfies 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is in `alphabet`, then `s1` is the string containing the single character `i`, `s2` is the string containing the single character `i` if the length of `alphabet` is 1, otherwise `s2` remains an empty string, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets excluding `i` if the length of `alphabet` is not 1, otherwise `alphabet` remains unchanged and includes `i`. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, `s1` and `s2` remain empty strings and `alphabet` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `m` is the length of `s` and satisfies 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, then if `len(alphabet) != 1`, `alphabet` excludes the character `i`. Otherwise, `s2` and `s1` are strings that include the character `i` appended to their previous values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `m` is the length of `s` and satisfies 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, then `s1` includes the character `i` appended to its previous value. If `len(alphabet) != 1`, then `alphabet` excludes the character `i`. If `len(alphabet) == 1`, then `s2` is updated to include the character `i` at the end.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
