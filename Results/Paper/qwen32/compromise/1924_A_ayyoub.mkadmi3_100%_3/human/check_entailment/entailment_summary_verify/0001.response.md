### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` against the problem requirements.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English letters occur as subsequences in the string `s`.
- If they do not, we need to provide an example of a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:

##### Main Loop:
1. The main loop reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
3. It calls `func_1(s, k, n)` which is supposed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.
4. Based on the result from `func_1`, it either prints "YES" or "NO" followed by a counterexample string if necessary.

##### Function `func_1`:
1. Initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings.
2. Creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English letters.
3. Iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
   - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it removes `i` from `alphabet` (unless `alphabet` has only one element).
   - Adds `i` to `s1`.
   - If `alphabet` becomes empty, it adds `i` to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
4. Calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
5. Returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

### Issues with the Code:

#### Logic of `func_1`:
- The logic of `func_1` is fundamentally flawed. The function attempts to track the removal of characters from the `alphabet` set, but it does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked.
- The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` is not sufficient to determine if all possible subsequences of length `n` exist in `s`. This condition only checks if there are enough characters to form `n` sequences of `k` unique characters, which is not equivalent to checking all subsequences of length `n`.

#### Counterexample Generation:
- The counterexample generation logic is also incorrect. The code attempts to find the first missing character in `s1` and constructs a string based on that, which does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid counterexample.
- Specifically, the code does not systematically check all possible subsequences of length `n` and identify a missing one.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English letters.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the missing string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified above, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
