Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English letters occur as a subsequence in the string `s`.
- If they do not, we need to provide an example of a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

### Provided Code Analysis:

#### Main Loop:
1. The main loop reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
3. It calls `func_1(s, k, n)` which is supposed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.
4. Based on the result from `func_1`, it either prints "YES" or "NO" followed by a counterexample string if necessary.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. Initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings.
2. Creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English letters.
3. Iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
   - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it removes `i` from `alphabet` (unless `alphabet` has only one element).
   - Adds `i` to `s1`.
   - If `alphabet` becomes empty, it adds `i` to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
4. Calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
5. Returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Logic of `func_1`**:
   - The logic of `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` can be subsequences in `s`. Instead, it seems to be trying to count occurrences of certain patterns but does not properly handle the requirement of checking all possible combinations of length `n`.
   
2. **Counterexample Generation**:
   - The counterexample generation logic is incorrect. It tries to find the first missing character in `s1` and constructs a string based on that, which does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid counterexample.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified above, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
