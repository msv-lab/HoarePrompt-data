Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`. If it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, the output should be `-1`.

### Key Observations:
1. **All Elements Same:** If all elements of the array are the same, it will always be beautiful regardless of how many elements are removed. In this case, the output should be `-1`.
2. **Longest Sequence of Same Elements:** To make the array not beautiful, we need to break the longest sequence of the same elements. The minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest sequence minus one, because removing one element from the longest sequence will prevent it from being fully replaced by adjacent elements.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the size of the array and the array itself.
3. Checking if all elements are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`.
4. Otherwise, it tries to find the length of the longest sequence of the same elements and prints the length of that sequence minus one.

### Issues in the Program:
The main issue with the program is in the logic to find the longest sequence of the same elements. The current implementation only checks sequences of the first element (`tmp = a[0]`). This is incorrect because there could be a longer sequence of a different element.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the longest sequence of any element in the array, not just the first one. Here's the corrected logic:
1. Initialize variables to keep track of the longest sequence length and the current sequence length.
2. Iterate through the array, updating the current sequence length when consecutive elements are the same.
3. Reset the current sequence length when consecutive elements are different.
4. Track the maximum sequence length encountered.
5. The answer is the maximum sequence length minus one, unless all elements are the same, in which case the answer is `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly find the longest sequence of any element in the array.

Correctness: **False**
