### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. However, the logic in the program does not correctly address the problem requirements.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Handling Uniform Arrays:**
   - It checks if all elements in the array are the same using `aa = set(a)`. If `len(aa) == 1`, it means all elements are identical, and it prints `-1` because a uniform array will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed.

3. **Finding the Minimum Consecutive Segment:**
   - The program then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element `tmp`.
   - It keeps a count `cnt` of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`. When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum count found so far and resets `cnt`.
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `ans` with the last counted segment.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs `ans`, which is supposed to be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

However, the logic has several issues:
   - The program only considers segments of elements equal to the first element `tmp`. It does not consider other possible segments or the overall structure of the beautiful array.
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property, which involves more complex analysis of the array structure rather than just counting consecutive segments of the first element.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It only handles the case where all elements are the same and fails to find the correct minimum number of elements to remove for other cases.

**Correctness: False**

The program needs a more sophisticated approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove, taking into account the entire structure of the beautiful array.
