Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`; `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`. If the current element of `a` at index `i` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the input integer `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
