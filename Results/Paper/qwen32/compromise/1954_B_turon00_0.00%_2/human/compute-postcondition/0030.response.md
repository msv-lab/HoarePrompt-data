To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved in the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so it can be ignored for this specific print statement.
- `n` is the input integer, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the list `a` (`a[0]`).
- `aa` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`. This set is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so it can be ignored for this specific print statement.
- `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp`.
- `ans` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` encountered during the loop, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is initialized to some value (likely the length of the first sequence of elements equal to `tmp`).
- As the code iterates through the list `a`, it counts consecutive elements equal to `tmp` and updates `cnt` accordingly.
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt` after each sequence of elements equal to `tmp` is counted.

### Final Output:
When the `print(ans)` statement is executed, it will print the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` encountered during the loop.

Thus, the output is:
Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to tmp encountered during the loop)**
