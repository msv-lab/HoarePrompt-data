The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the variable `cnt` by 1. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; and `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `cnt` is increased by 1.**
