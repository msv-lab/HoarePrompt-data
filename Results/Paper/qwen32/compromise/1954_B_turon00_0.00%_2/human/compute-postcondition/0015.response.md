The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially set to `n` and `cnt` is `0`. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to `0` because `0` is less than `n` (as `n` is greater than `0`).

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is 0; `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`**.
