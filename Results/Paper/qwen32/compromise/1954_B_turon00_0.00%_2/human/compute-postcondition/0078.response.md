The code snippet provided increments the variable `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `cnt`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than `t`, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is the newly input integer `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 0, `i` is `t`**.
