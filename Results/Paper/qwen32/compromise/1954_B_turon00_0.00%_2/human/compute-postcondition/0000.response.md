The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After executing this line, `t` will hold the value of the integer input provided. The other variables (`n`, `a`) and their conditions remain unchanged as they have not been affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input value such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
