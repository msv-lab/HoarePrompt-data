Postcondition: **`a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the newly input integer `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
