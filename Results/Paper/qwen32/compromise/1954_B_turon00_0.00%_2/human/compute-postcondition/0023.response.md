The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. The variable `n` does not change from one iteration to the next.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` (from its value at the end of the previous iteration) and `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.** 

Note: The values of `cnt`, `ans`, and `tmp` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, but they are part of the program state and would be carried over as they are. However, as per the instructions, we only adjust the state of objects in the loop head.
