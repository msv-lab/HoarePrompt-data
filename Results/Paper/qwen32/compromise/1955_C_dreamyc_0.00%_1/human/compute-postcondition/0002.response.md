To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that both conditions in the loop head are satisfied: `k` is non-zero and `len(nums)` is at least 2.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15.
- `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
- `ans` is 0.

We need to adjust `k` and `nums` to ensure the loop can execute.

1. **Adjusting `k`:** Since `k` must be non-zero, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0. Given that `k` is already defined as 1 <= k <= 10^15, this condition is already satisfied. No change is needed for `k`.

2. **Adjusting `nums`:** The condition `len(nums) >= 2` must be satisfied. Given that `nums` is a deque of `n` integers, and `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0**.
