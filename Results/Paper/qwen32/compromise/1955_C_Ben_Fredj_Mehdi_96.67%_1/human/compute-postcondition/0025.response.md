The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'10000'`. This output is independent of the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k` as described in the initial state. The `print` statement directly specifies the string to be printed, and no computation or evaluation of the variables is involved in generating this output.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **10000**
