Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line with the first element decremented by 1, the last element of `a` is decremented by 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space, `k` is at least 2, `d` is `len(a) - 2` if `a[len(a) - 1]` is 0, otherwise `d` is `len(a) - 1`, and `g` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` is 0 or not. If the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[d+1]` if `d` was originally `len(a) - 2`) is 0, then `d` is updated to `len(a) - 2`.**
