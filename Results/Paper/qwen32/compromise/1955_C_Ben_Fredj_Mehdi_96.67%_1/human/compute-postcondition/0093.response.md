Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `k` retain their initial values; `a` is a list of integers where the first non-zero element `a[g]` is `a[g] - 2`, and the last element is `a[d] - 2` if `a[d]` was not 0, otherwise `a[d]` is -1; `d` is equal to `len(a) - 3` if `a[d]` was 0, otherwise `d` is equal to `len(a) - 2`; `g` is 2 if `a[0]` is 0 and `a[g]` was 0, otherwise `g` is 1; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `d` is decremented by 1, so if `a[d]` was initially 0, `d` becomes `len(a) - 3`. If `a[d]` was not 0, `d` becomes `len(a) - 2`.
- All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
