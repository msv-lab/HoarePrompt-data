The exception in the provided `try` block could occur at either of the two lines where we attempt to decrement the elements of the list `a` by converting them to integers:

1. `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1`
2. `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`

An exception would occur if `a[g]` or `a[d]` cannot be converted to an integer. This could happen if the elements at these indices are not valid integer strings.

If no exception occurs, the program will:
- Decrement the element at index `g` by 2 (since it was already decremented by 1 in the `try` block).
- Decrement the element at index `d` by 1 (since it was already decremented by 1 in the `try` block).
- Update `g` to 1 if the element at index `g` becomes 0, otherwise, it remains 0.
- Update `d` to `len(a) - 3` if the element at index `d` becomes 0, otherwise, it remains `len(a) - 2` if the last element of `a` was 0, and `len(a) - 1` otherwise.
- Increment `i` by 1.

If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state becomes unknown.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. If no exception occurs, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line with the first element decremented by 2, the last element decremented by 1, and the element at index `d` further decremented by 1. `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space, `k` is at least 2, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` was 0 and 2 otherwise, and `d` is updated to `len(a) - 3` if the element at index `d` is 0, otherwise, `d` remains `len(a) - 2` if the last element of `a` was 0, and `len(a) - 1` otherwise. `i` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
