Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line; `z` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the first space + 1 to the end of the string. If `k` equals 199999999999999, no changes are made to `a` or `z`. Otherwise, if `k` equals 1000000000000, 200000000000, 2147483648 (and `n` is not 2), 1000000000 (and `n` is not 2 or `a` is not [1000000000, 1000000000]), 2147483648 (and `n` is not 5), 10000000000 (and `n` is not 20), 5999999999, or 4294967295, no changes are made to `a`. If `n` equals 2, `k` equals `a[0] - 1`, and `k` equals `a[1] - 2`, no changes are made to `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of `a`, no changes are made to `a` except that `z` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than the sum of `a`, the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements of `a` are decremented by 1. If `k` is odd, the element at index `g` is decremented by an additional 1. `g` is incremented by the number of leading zeros encountered and decremented; `d` is decremented by the number of trailing zeros encountered and decremented; and `i` is `k // 2`.**
