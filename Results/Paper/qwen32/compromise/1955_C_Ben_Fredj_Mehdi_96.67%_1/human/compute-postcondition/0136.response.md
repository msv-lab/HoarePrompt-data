The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print('1000')`. This statement explicitly prints the string `'1000'`. The value to be printed is directly provided in the `print` function and does not depend on any variables or their values from the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes `t` as an integer input within the range 1 to 10,000.
2. `a` is described as a list of integers, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
3. `z` is described as `z + 1`, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.
4. The `print` statement explicitly outputs the string `'1000'`.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'1000'`, the output does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `z`.

Output: **1000**
