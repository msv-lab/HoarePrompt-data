Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers. If `k` is equal to 199999999999999, no changes are made to `a`, `n`, or `k`. Otherwise, if `k` is equal to 1000000000000, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. If `k` is equal to 200000000000, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. If `k` is equal to 2147483648 and `n` is equal to 2, `k` and `n` retain their initial values. If `n` is 2, `k` is equal to `a[0] - 1`, and `k` is also equal to `a[1] - 2`, then no changes are made to `a`. If `n` is 5 and `k` is 2147483648, no changes are made to `a`. If `n` is 20 and `k` is 10000000000, or if `k` is 5999999999, or if `k` is 4294967295, no changes are made to `a`. If `k` is 3000000000, `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`, `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`, the first `k // 2` non-zero elements from the start and the first `k // 2` non-zero elements from the end of `a` are each decremented by 1. Additionally, if `k % 2 == 1`, the next non-zero element after the last decrement from the start (`g`) and the next non-zero element after the last decrement from the end (`d`) are further decremented by 1. `k` is not equal to 1999999998, `k` is not equal to 1999999999, `k` is not equal to 99999999999; either `n` is not equal to 1, or `k` is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of `a` is not 1; `k` is not equal to 9999999999; it is not the case that `n` is equal to 101 and `k` is equal to 100000000000; `k` is not equal to 10000000000000; `k` is not equal to 99999999999999; `k` is not equal to 199999999999999.**
