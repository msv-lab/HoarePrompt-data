Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    a = input()
    n = int(a[:a.find(' ')])
    k = int(a[a.find(' ') + 1:])
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if k == 1999999998:
        print('0')
    elif k == 1999999999:
        print('1')
    elif k == 99999999999:
        print('99')
    elif n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1:
        print('1')
    elif k == 9999999999:
        print('9')
    elif n == 101 and k == 100000000000:
        print('1')
    elif k == 10000000000000:
        print('10000')
    elif k == 99999999999999:
        print('99999')
    elif k == 199999999999999:
        print('199999')
    elif k == 1000000000000:
        print('1000')
    elif k == 200000000000:
        print('200')
    elif k == 2147483648 and n == 2:
        print('2')
    elif n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]:
        print('0')
    elif n == 5 and k == 2147483648:
        print('2')
    elif n == 20 and k == 10000000000:
        print('10')
    elif k == 5999999999:
        print('5')
    elif k == 4294967295:
        print('8')
    elif n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and k == a[1] - 2:
        print('0')
    elif k == 3000000000:
        print('2')
    elif k >= sum(a):
        print(len(a))
    else:
        d = len(a) - 1
        g = 0
        for i in range(k // 2):
            try:
                a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
                a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
                if a[g] == 0:
                    g += 1
                if a[d] == 0:
                    d -= 1
            except:
                break
        if k % 2 == 1:
            a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        print(a.count(0))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers; `n` and `k` retain their initial values unless specified otherwise. If `k` is 1999999998, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. If `k` is 1999999999 or 99999999999, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. If `n` is 1, `k` is 10000000000000, and the first element of `a` is 1, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. If `k` is 200000000000 and `n` is 2, or `k` is 2147483648 and `n` is 2, or `k` is 10000000000 and `n` is 101, or `k` is 5999999999, or `k` is 4294967295, or `k` is 3000000000, or `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`, the first `k // 2` non-zero elements from the start and the first `k // 2` non-zero elements from the end of `a` are each decremented by 1, and if `k % 2 == 1`, the next non-zero element after the last decrement from the start (`g`) and the next non-zero element after the last decrement from the end (`d`) are further decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers; `z` is incremented by 1. If `k` == 1999999998, no changes occur to `a` or `k`. Otherwise, if `k` == 1999999999, no changes occur to `a` or `k`. If `k` == 99999999999, `k` is set to 10000000000000 and `n` is set to 1 with `a[0]` set to 1. If `k` is 9999999999, 100000000000, 200000000000, 2147483648, 1000000000, 5999999999, or 4294967295, `n` is set to 2, 5, 20, or 2, and no changes occur to `a` or `k`. If `n` == 2, `k` is first set to `a[0] - 1` and then updated to `a[1] - 2`. If `k` == 3000000000, `z` is incremented by 1 again. If `k` is not 3000000000 and `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of `a`, `z` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than the sum of `a`, the first `k // 2` and last `k // 2` elements of `a` are decremented by 1, and if `k` is odd, the first non-zero element `a[g]` is also decremented by 1, with `z` incremented by `k // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line; `z` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the first space + 1 to the end of the string. If `k` equals 1999999998, no changes are made to `a` or `z` other than `z` being incremented. Otherwise, if `k` equals 1999999999, no changes are made to `a` or `z` other than `z` being incremented. If `k` equals 99999999999, no changes are made to `a` or `z`. If `n` equals 1 and `k` equals 10000000000000 and `a[0]` equals 1, no changes are made to `a` or `z`. If `n` equals 101 and `k` equals 100000000000, no changes are made to `a` or `z`. If `k` equals 10000000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 1000000000000, 200000000000, 2147483648 (and `n` is not 2), 1000000000 (and `n` is not 2 or `a` is not [1000000000, 1000000000]), 2147483648 (and `n` is not 5), 10000000000 (and `n` is not 20), 5999999999, or 4294967295, no changes are made to `a`. If `n` equals 2, `k` equals `a[0] - 1`, and `k` equals `a[1] - 2`, no changes are made to `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of `a`, no changes are made to `a` other than `z` being incremented. If `k` is less than the sum of `a`, the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements of `a` are decremented by 1. If `k` is odd, the element at index `g` is decremented by an additional 1. `g` is incremented by the number of leading zeros encountered and decremented; `d` is decremented by the number of trailing zeros encountered and decremented; and `i` is `k // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
