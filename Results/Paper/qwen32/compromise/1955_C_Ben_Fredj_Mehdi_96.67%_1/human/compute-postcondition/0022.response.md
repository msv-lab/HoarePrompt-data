The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'1'`. The initial state provides several details about the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but these details do not affect the execution of the `print` statement in any way. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'1'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('1')`.
2. The string `'1'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on any variables or conditions.
3. Therefore, the output will be the string `'1'`.

Output: **1**
