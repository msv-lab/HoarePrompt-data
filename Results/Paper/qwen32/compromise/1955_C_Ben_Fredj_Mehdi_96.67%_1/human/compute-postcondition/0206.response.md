The code snippet extracts the integer value from the substring of `a` starting right after the first space. 

Given the initial state, `a` is a string and `n` is already assigned the integer value of the substring of `a` from the start up to the first space. The variable `k` is now assigned the integer value of the substring of `a` from the character right after the first space to the end of the string. The variables `t`, `a`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a string equal to the input; `z` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of `a` from the start up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` from the first space + 1 to the end of the string.**
