The given initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('200')
```

This statement is printing a string literal, `'200'`. The value to be printed is explicitly given in the code and does not depend on the values of any variables defined in the initial state.

Thus, the output will be the string `'200'`.

Output: **200**
