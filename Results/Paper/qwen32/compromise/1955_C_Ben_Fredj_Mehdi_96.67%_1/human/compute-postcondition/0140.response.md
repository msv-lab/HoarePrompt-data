Let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
3. `z` is `z + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('2')`. This statement explicitly prints the string `'2'`. 

- The value `'2'` is a literal string and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, or `z`.
- Even though `z` is updated by incrementing it by 1 (`z = z + 1`), this operation does not affect the output of the `print` statement because the `print` statement is printing the literal string `'2'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
