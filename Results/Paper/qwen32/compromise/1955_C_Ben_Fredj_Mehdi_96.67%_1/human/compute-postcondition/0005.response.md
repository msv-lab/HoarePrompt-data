The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split part into an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `a`. This means that `a` will no longer hold the value it initially had (which was a string value provided by the input function). The variables `n` and `k` are no longer explicitly defined in the given code snippet, so their values remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting an input string by spaces and converting each part to an integer; `n` and `k` retain their initial values.**
