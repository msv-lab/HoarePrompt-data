Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers; `n` and `k` retain their initial values unless specified otherwise; `k` is not equal to 1999999998, `k` is not equal to 1999999999, and `k` is not equal to 99999999999. If `n` is 1, `k` is 10000000000000, and the first element of `a` is 1, then the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, `n` and `k` retain their initial values unless `k` is 200000000000 or `k` is 2147483648 and `n` is 2, or `k` is 10000000000 and `n` is 101, or `k` is 5999999999, or `k` is 4294967295, or `k` is 3000000000, or `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`, in which case no changes are made to `n` or `k`. If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`, the first `k // 2` non-zero elements from the start and the first `k // 2` non-zero elements from the end of `a` are each decremented by 1, and if `k % 2 == 1`, the next non-zero element after the last decrement from the start (`g`) and the next non-zero element after the last decrement from the end (`d`) are further decremented by 1.**
