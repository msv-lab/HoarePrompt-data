The provided `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('1000')
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The string `'1000'` is explicitly provided to be printed.

Let's break down the initial state to ensure there's no misunderstanding:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line.
- `z` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the first space + 1 to the end of the string.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, `k`) are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'1000'`.

Output: **1000**
