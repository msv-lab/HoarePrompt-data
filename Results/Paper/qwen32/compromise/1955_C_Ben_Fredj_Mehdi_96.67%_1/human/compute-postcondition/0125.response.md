The code snippet assigns a new value to `k` based on the substring of `a` starting right after the first space. The values of `t`, `a`, `n`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a string; `n` is the integer value of the substring of `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` starting from the character right after the first space; `z` is `z + 1`.**
