Postcondition: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `k` retain their initial values; `a` is a list of integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the first `k // 2` non-zero elements from the start and the first `k // 2` non-zero elements from the end of `a` are each decremented by 1. If `k % 2 == 1`, the value at the next non-zero element after the last decrement from the start (`g`) and the value at the next non-zero element after the last decrement from the end (`d`) are further decremented by 1.**
