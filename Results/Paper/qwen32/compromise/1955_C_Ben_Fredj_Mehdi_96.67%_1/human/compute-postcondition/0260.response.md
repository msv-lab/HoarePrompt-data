Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements have been decremented by 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the first space + 1 to the end of the string, `k` is odd, `g` is incremented by the number of leading zeros encountered and decremented, `d` is decremented by the number of trailing zeros encountered and decremented, and `i` is `k // 2`.**
