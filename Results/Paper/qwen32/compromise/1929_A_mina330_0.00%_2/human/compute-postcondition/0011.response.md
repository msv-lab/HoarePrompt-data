Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `kq` is updated to `kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`**

In natural language, the value of `i` remains `i + 1` as it was in the initial state. The variable `kq` is updated by adding the element at the position `len(a) - i - 1` of the list `a` and subtracting the element at the position `i` of the list `a` from its current value.
