The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `len(a) // 2`, and the step value `1`. Therefore, we can only adjust the value of `i` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Given that `i` is currently 4 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (as per the step value) and must still be less than `len(a) // 2`.

State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `kq` is `kq + a[len(a) - 5] - a[4]`, `itest` is `itest + 1`, `ntest` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 5**
