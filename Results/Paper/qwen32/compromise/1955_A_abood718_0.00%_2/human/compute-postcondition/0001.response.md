To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each test case. The loop reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. The output for each test case is determined by the following conditions:

1. If `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`.
2. Else if `A % 2 == 0`, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
3. Otherwise, it prints `X` (which is `A // 2`), and then prints `X * C + B`.

Let's break down the changes in the state of the variables:

- `t` is the number of test cases and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are read from the input for each test case and do not persist between iterations; they are local to each test case.
- The output is printed based on the conditions mentioned above, and this output is not stored in any variable, so it doesn't affect the variables in the loop head or body.

Since the variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are re-assigned in each iteration and do not persist after the loop, and since `t` remains unchanged, the only thing that changes is the printed output for each test case.

Given that the initial state includes `t` and the loop processes `t` test cases, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **The loop has processed all `t` test cases and printed the output for each test case based on the given conditions. The value of `t` remains unchanged.**

Since the problem asks for a description of the output state in a format similar to the initial state, and considering that `t` is the only variable from the initial state that remains relevant, we can state:

Output State: **t is the same integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All test cases have been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed.**
