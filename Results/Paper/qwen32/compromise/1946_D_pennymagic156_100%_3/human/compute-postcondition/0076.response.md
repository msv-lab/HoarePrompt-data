The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. 

Given the initial state, if `op` is 0, `t` initially contains `ai`. If `op` is not 0, `t` is initially an empty list. After executing `t.append(ai)`, `t` will contain `ai` regardless of its initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `val` is the second element of `a`, `t` is a list containing `ai`.**
