To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
op ^= val >> i & 1
```

Here, `val` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer that `val` might be `x` or another variable since `u` is described as the `i`-th bit of `x`. For the sake of this example, let's assume `val` is `x` (as `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`).

The operation `val >> i & 1` extracts the `i`-th bit of `val`. Let's denote this extracted bit as `bit_val`.

The operation `op ^= bit_val` performs a bitwise XOR between `op` and `bit_val`. Given that `op` is initially 0, the result of `op ^= bit_val` will simply be `bit_val`.

So, the new value of `op` will be the `i`-th bit of `x`.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the updated output state will be:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, and `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. During the current iteration, `u` is not 0, and `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `cnt` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` and `x` remain the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` remains the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` remains an empty list, `ans` remains -1, `i` continues to iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` remains the `i`-th bit of `x`, and `v` remains the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. During the current iteration, `u` is not 0, and `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is now the `i`-th bit of `x`, and `cnt` remains 0.
