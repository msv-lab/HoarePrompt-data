The given code snippet performs a bitwise operation on the variable `op`. Specifically, it updates `op` using the XOR (`^=`) operator with the result of `val >> i & 1`.

Here's the breakdown of what happens:
- `val >> i` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions.
- `& 1` extracts the least significant bit (LSB) of the result from the previous operation, which effectively gives the `i`-th bit of `val`.
- `op ^= ...` updates `op` by performing a bitwise XOR between its current value and the extracted bit.

Since `val` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. However, we know the operation affects `op`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `op`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is 0**.
