Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val`, `ai` is `val`. The `i`-th bit of `val` (`op`) is 0.**
