Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0, `t` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0. If `v` (the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`) is odd, then `v % 2` is not equal to 0. If `v` is even and non-zero, `a` is a non-empty list, `ans` is `max(-1, cnt)`, and `op` is 0 or 1 depending on the last element processed, where `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop execution. If `v` is 0, `ans` remains -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
