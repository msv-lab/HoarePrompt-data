Let's analyze the given Python code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a non-empty list
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 1
- `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0
- `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero
- `val` is the second element in `a`
- `op` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it exists and has some value

Code Snippet:
```python
op ^= val >> i & 1
```

Explanation:
- `val >> i & 1` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with 1. This operation extracts the `i`-th bit of `val`.
- `op ^= ...` performs a bitwise XOR between the current value of `op` and the extracted `i`-th bit of `val`.

Impact:
- The value of `op` changes due to the XOR operation with the `i`-th bit of `val`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a non-empty list
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 1
- `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0
- `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero
- `val` is the second element in `a`
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero, `val` is the second element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`**
