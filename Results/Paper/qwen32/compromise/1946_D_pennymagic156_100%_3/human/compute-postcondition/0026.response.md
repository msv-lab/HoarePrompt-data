The only object in the loop head is the variable `val`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least two elements, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least two elements, `val` is the second element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `val` should be the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `[val, val]` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and currently is 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and currently is even, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` remains unchanged, `val` is the first element in the list `a`**
