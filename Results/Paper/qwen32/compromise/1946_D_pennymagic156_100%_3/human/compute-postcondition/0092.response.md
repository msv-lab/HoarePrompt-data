Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. `t` is an empty list. `ans` is -1. `i` is 1. `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0. `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and is even. Additionally, `v` is truthy (non-zero). `op` is 0. `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The variables `op` and `cnt` have been initialized to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
