Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `t` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` such that `v % 2` is equal to 0 and `v` is non-zero, `op` is `val & 1`, `cnt` is 2, `val` is the second element of `a`.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
