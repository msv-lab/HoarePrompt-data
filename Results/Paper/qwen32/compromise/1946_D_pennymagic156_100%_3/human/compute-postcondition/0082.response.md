The code snippet appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. This means that regardless of the initial state of `t`, it will now contain `ai` as its last element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `val` is the third element of `a`, and `t` is a list containing `ai`**.
