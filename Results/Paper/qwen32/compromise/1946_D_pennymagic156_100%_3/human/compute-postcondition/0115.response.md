The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the flow outside of the loop. Since there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the context, the `continue` statement would typically be part of a loop structure (like `for` or `while`). Without such a loop, the `continue` statement has no effect.

Given that there is no loop to skip over, none of the variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `i`, `u`, `v`) are modified by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. `t` is an empty list. `i` is 0. `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`. `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.**
