The code snippet provided increments the variable `cnt` by 1. None of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `val`, `op`) are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `cnt` is now `cnt + 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero, `val` is the third element in `a`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`.**
