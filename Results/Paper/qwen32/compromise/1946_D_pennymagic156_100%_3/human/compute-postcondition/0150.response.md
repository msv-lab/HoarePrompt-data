Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` such that `v % 2` is equal to 0 and `v` is non-zero. If `op` is 0, then `op` is set to 0 and `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `op` remains 1 and `cnt` remains 0.**
