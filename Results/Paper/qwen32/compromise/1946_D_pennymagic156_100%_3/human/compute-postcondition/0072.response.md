Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least one element, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is either 0 or the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and `ai` is `val`. If `op` is 0, then `t` is a list containing `ai`; otherwise, `t` remains an empty list.**
