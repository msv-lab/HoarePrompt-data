Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[2, 0]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[0, 2]`, and `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is set to `zeroes - 2`. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
