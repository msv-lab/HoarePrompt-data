Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[3, 0]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[0, 3]`, and `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is set to `zeroes - 2` if the if block is executed, or `2 * zeroes - 5` if the else block is executed. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is set to 2 if the if block is executed, or `zeroes + 1` if the else block is executed.**
