The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given that `c` is the next element in the list `s` and can only be 0 or 1, this operation will increase either `cnt[0]` or `cnt[1]` by 1.

If `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1. Since `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the current list `s`, and `c` is the next element, if `c` is 0, `zeroes` should also be incremented by 1. However, the problem does not specify that `zeroes` should be updated in this code snippet, so we only update `cnt`.

Given these points, the output state will reflect the updated `cnt` list. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers (0s and 1s) from the input and must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the current list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1+1, 0]` if `c` is 0 or `[1, 0+1]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
