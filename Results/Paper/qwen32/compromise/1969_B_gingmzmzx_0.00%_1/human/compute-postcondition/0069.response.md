The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `zeroes - cnt[0]`. Given the initial state, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, and `cnt[0]` is either 3 if `c` is 0, or 1 if `c` is 1.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be its previous value plus the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is `[3, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[1, 2]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`, `ans` is updated to its previous value plus (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).**
