Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is `[3, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[1, 2]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value plus (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).**
