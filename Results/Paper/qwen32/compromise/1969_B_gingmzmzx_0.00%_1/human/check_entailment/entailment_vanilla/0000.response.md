Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the minimum total cost required to sort a binary string `s` in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `k` is `k`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the string and keeping track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `zeroes`: Counts the total number of 0s in the string.
   - `cnt`: An array of size 2 to count occurrences of 0s and 1s as we iterate through the string.
   - `ans`: Accumulates the total cost.

2. **Iteration through the String**:
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - Increment the corresponding count in `cnt`.
     - If `c` is 0:
       - Add 1 to `ans` if there have been any 1s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). This suggests that each 0 encountered after at least one 1 contributes to the cost because it needs to be moved past those 1s.
     - If `c` is 1:
       - Add the difference between the total number of 0s and the number of 0s encountered so far (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`. This suggests that each 1 encountered needs to be moved past all the remaining 0s to the right.

### Issues with the Logic:
- The logic does not accurately represent the cost of cyclic shifts. The cost should reflect the length of the substring being shifted, not just the number of 0s or 1s encountered.
- The program does not consider the actual cyclic shifting process and its cost. Instead, it uses a heuristic that does not guarantee the minimum cost.

### Correct Approach:
To find the minimum cost, one would need to consider the positions of the 0s and 1s and calculate the cost of moving them to their correct positions. A more accurate approach involves dynamic programming or a greedy strategy that considers the actual cost of shifting substrings.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string as per the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: False**
