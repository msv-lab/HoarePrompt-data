Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` (the number of test cases) is greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `ans` is the first element of `a`; `res` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is 0, then `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `0 // (i + 1)`, and `res` is `n - 1 + 0 % (i + 1)` if `i` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains `n - 1`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is not 0, or if `dif` is 0, then `ans` and `res` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is not 0, then either `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is updated to `ans + dif`, and `res` is decreased by 1, or `k` is 0, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, and if `i` is not 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 2`, and `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` was originally greater than 0, then if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and if `i` is not 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. If `k` was originally 0, no changes are made to `ans`, `k`, or `res`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
