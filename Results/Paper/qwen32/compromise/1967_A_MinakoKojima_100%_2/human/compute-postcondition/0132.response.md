The value of `ans` is updated by adding `k // n` to it. The values of `k`, `n`, `res`, and the precondition that `ans` is the maximum possible value achieved by adding differences from `a` while `k` is sufficient, and `k` is not 0, remain unchanged. The number of iterations where `dif` was 0, `res`, is also not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value achieved by adding differences from `a` while `k` is sufficient, plus `k // n`; `k` is not 0; `res` is the number of iterations where `dif` was 0.**
