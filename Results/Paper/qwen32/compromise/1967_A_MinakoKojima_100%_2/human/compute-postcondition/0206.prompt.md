Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case consists of two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12), representing the number of cards of each type initially. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) is provided at the beginning, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5. `ans_list` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = a[0]
    res = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
        if dif == 0:
            res -= 1
        if dif != 0:
            if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                ans += dif
                k -= dif * (i + 1)
                res -= 1
            else:
                ans += k // (i + 1)
                if i != 0:
                    res += k % (i + 1)
                k = 0
                break
            if k == 0:
                break
    if k != 0:
        ans += k // n
        res += k % n
    ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
    ans += res
    ans_list.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is the maximum possible value incrementally adjusted by differences in `a` within the constraints of `k` plus `k // n` if `k` is not `0`, plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, plus `res`; `k` is not `0` if it was adjusted by `k // n`, otherwise it remains `0`; `res` is the count of elements not adjusted due to `k` exhaustion or `dif` being `0` plus `k % n` if `k` is not `0`. Otherwise, `res` remains the count of elements not adjusted due to `k` exhaustion or `dif` being `0`; `ans_list` contains `ans` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is the maximum possible value achieved by adding differences from `a` while `k` is sufficient plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` plus `res`, `res` is unchanged, `ans_list` now includes `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the remaining count of unadjusted elements, `ans_list` includes the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`, `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and `k` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
