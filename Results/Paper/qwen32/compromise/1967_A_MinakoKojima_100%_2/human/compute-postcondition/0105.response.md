The code snippet `ans += k // (i + 1)` modifies the variable `ans` by adding the integer division of `k` by `i + 1` to it. The variables `i`, `dif`, and `res` are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`
- If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `res - 1`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + k // (i + 1)`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`; If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `res - 1`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged; `ans` is `ans + k // (i + 1)`**.
