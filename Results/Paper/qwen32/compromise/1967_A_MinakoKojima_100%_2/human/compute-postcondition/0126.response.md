Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 2`, `dif` is `a[i + 3] - a[i + 2]`. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `res` is decreased by 1, `ans` is `ans + dif`, and `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + k // (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is further updated to `res + k % (i + 1)`. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1 in both cases. `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
