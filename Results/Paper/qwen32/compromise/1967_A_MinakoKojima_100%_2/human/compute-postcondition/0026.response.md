Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `0 // (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1 + 0 % (i + 1)` if `i` is not 0, and `res` remains `n - 1` if `i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, and the loop or if statement is broken out of.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.
