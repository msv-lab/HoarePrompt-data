The code snippet `ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)` updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` to it. The values of `res`, `ans_list`, `n`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Let's denote the initial value of `ans` as `ans_initial`. After the execution of the code, the new value of `ans` will be `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1)`.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, `res` is the remaining count of unadjusted elements, `ans_list` includes the final `ans`, `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and `k` is 0.**
