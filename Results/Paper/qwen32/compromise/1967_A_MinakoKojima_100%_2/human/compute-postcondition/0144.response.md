The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range is determined by `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, the range `n - 1` must be at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2. The variables `ans`, `res`, `ans_list`, and the list `a` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_list` includes `ans`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 0**
