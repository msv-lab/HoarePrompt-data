Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value incrementally adjusted by differences in `a` within the constraints of `k` plus `k // n`, `k` is not `0`, and `res` is the count of elements not adjusted due to `k` exhaustion or `dif` being `0`.**

In simple terms, `ans` has been increased by the integer division of `k` by `n`. The values of `k` and `res` remain unchanged.
