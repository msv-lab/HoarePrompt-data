Postcondition: **`ans` is either `a[0] + dif` or `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `dif` is not 0, `res` is `n - 2` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)` and `i` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)` depending on whether `k < dif * (i + 1)`. `ans_list` includes `ans`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, and `i` is 0.**
