The loop head in the provided for loop is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This implies that the loop will iterate a number of times based on the user input, and the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body (as it is represented by an underscore).

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state of the program in any way, and the number of iterations is determined by the input, the state at the start of the next iteration does not need to change any variables that are part of the loop head. 

However, the state description includes variables like `ans`, `k`, `res`, and `ans_list` which are not part of the loop head but are mentioned as part of the program state. Since we are only supposed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, none of these need to be changed.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, with respect to the loop head.

State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value incrementally adjusted by differences in `a` within the constraints of `k` plus `k // n` if `k` is not `0`, plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, plus `res`; `k` is not `0` if it was adjusted by `k // n`, otherwise it remains `0`; `res` is the count of elements not adjusted due to `k` exhaustion or `dif` being `0` plus `k % n` if `k` is not `0`. Otherwise, `res` remains the count of elements not adjusted due to `k` exhaustion or `dif` being `0`; `ans_list` contains `ans` as its last element.**
