Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to find a solution by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then distributing the bets based on the LCM, but this approach does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

Here's a specific counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1 1
```
or any other valid distribution such as `2 2 2`, `3 3 3`, etc., as long as the total bet (6 in this case) is less than the amount received for any winning outcome (which is 4 in this case).

**Program Output:**
```
-1
```

The program incorrectly outputs `-1` for this input because it cannot find a valid distribution of bets that satisfies the condition using the LCM method. However, a valid solution exists, such as betting 1 coin on each outcome, which results in a total bet of 3 coins, and the amount received for any winning outcome is 4 coins.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to find a valid solution in cases where one exists.
