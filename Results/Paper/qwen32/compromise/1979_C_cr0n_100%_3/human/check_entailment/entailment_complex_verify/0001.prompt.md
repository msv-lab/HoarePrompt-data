You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Annotated Code: 
from math import gcd

cases = int(input())
for n in range(cases):
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the least common multiple of `a` and `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both greater than or equal to 1, and returns their least common multiple.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of outcomes, and vals is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier (k_i) for the corresponding outcome such that 2 <= k_i <= 20.
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: N is the integer value input by the user, vals is a list of integers, den is the product of all elements in vals.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State: `N` is the integer value input by the user, `vals` is a list of integers, `den` is the product of all elements in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`, `vprod` is a list where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: [den/v1] [den/v2] ... [den/vk] (where den = prod_vals / (1 + (1/v1 + 1/v2 + ... + 1/vk)) and vprod[i] = den / vals[i])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from the user input. It calculates a value `den` as the product of all elements in `vals`, then computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. It adjusts `den` by subtracting the sum of `vprod`. If the adjusted `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function returns `None`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's walk through the logic and verify whether it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Given multipliers `k_i` for each outcome, the received amount for a winning outcome `i` is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on that outcome. The total bet is the sum of all `x_i`. The solution needs to ensure that for any `i`, `k_i * x_i > sum(x_j) for all j`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **Logic:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `func_1` function.
   - It then computes `vprod` as the LCM divided by each multiplier `k_i`, resulting in a list of integers.
   - It calculates `den` as the LCM minus the sum of `vprod`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as the bet distribution.

3. **Verification:**
   - The approach assumes that `vprod` values satisfy the condition because the LCM is the smallest number that is divisible by all `k_i`. By dividing the LCM by each `k_i`, we get a set of integers whose sum (when multiplied by `k_i`) can be compared with the LCM.
   - The check `den <= 0` ensures that the sum of `vprod` is less than the LCM, which means `k_i * vprod[i] > sum(vprod)` for any `i`.

### Correctness Check
Let's verify if the program satisfies the problem requirements:

- **Case 1:**
  - Input: `3 3 2 7`
  - Expected Output: `27 41 12`
  - The LCM of `3, 2, 7` is `42`. `vprod` becomes `[42/3, 42/2, 42/7]` which is `[14, 21, 6]`. The sum of `vprod` is `41`, and `den` is `42 - 41 = 1 > 0`. The output `[14, 21, 6]` works because `3*14=42 > 41`, `2*21=42 > 41`, and `7*6=42 > 41`.

- **Case 2:**
  - Input: `2 3 3`
  - Expected Output: `1 1`
  - The LCM of `3, 3` is `3`. `vprod` becomes `[3/3, 3/3]` which is `[1, 1]`. The sum of `vprod` is `2`, and `den` is `3 - 2 = 1 > 0`. The output `[1, 1]` works because `3*1=3 > 2` and `3*1=3 > 2`.

- **Case 3:**
  - Input: `5 5 5 5 5`
  - Expected Output: `-1`
  - The LCM of `5, 5, 5, 5, 5` is `5`. `vprod` becomes `[5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5]` which is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The sum of `vprod` is `5`, and `den` is `5 - 5 = 0`. The output `-1` is correct because no valid distribution exists.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of bets exists and outputs the distribution if possible. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
