The function `lcm(a, b)` is expected to take two positive integers `a` and `b` as input. However, based on the problem description provided, the relevant precondition for the main problem should describe the input for the function that solves the described problem. Assuming the function to solve the problem is defined as `find_bets(test_cases)`, the precondition would be: test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is given separately and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
