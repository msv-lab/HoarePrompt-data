Output State: **`N` is the integer value input by the user, `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each element is a multiplier (k_i) such that 2 <= k_i <= 20, `den` is the first element of `vals`.**

In simple terms, the value of `den` has been set to the first element of the list `vals`. All other variables remain unchanged.
