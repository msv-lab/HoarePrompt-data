Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins ('U'). According to the problem statement, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. The program uses the `count` method on the string to count the number of 'U's and checks if this count is odd or even, appending the appropriate result ('yes' or 'no') to the results list. Finally, it prints out the results for each test case. This approach is consistent with the optimal strategy for the game as described in the problem.
