The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state except for the newly introduced `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D"; `results` is an empty list.**
