Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a string `s`, and `s` itself which consists only of the characters "U" and "D". The function returns the final position after processing each string `s` where "U" means moving up by one unit and "D" means moving down by one unit, starting from position 0.**
