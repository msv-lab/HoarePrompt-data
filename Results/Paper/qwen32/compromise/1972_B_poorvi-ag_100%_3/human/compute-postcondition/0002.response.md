The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `i` and the range it iterates over is determined by `t`. Therefore, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts as it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Since `t` is described as an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 100`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The other variables `n`, `s`, and `results` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `results` is an empty list, `i` is initialized by the loop**
