Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is either True or False, `reachable_second_row` remains True if it was True before the if statement, and `results` is ['NO']. There is no change in the state of the variables if `reachable_second_row` is False. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` remains True. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.**
