Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `results` is ['NO'], `j` is 1. If `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. If `row1[j]` is not '>', `reachable_first_row` is set to False.**
