Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `results` is ['NO', 'YES']**
The `results` list now contains two elements: 'NO' and 'YES'. All other variables retain their initial values.
