Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is True, and `reachable_second_row` is True.**

This means that after entering the if condition, `reachable_second_row` is confirmed to be True, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition.
