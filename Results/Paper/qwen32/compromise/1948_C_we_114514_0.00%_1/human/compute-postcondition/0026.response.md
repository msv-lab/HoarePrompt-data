The code snippet `reachable_second_row = True` sets the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` was less than `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration), `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` retains its value from the end of the previous iteration, and `reachable_second_row` is True**.
