The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3, but since `j` will be equal to `n`, the loop will not execute again.

However, if we are to adjust the state to reflect the start of the next iteration before the loop condition is checked again, we would increment `j` by 1.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is True if `j` is 2 and `row1[j]` is not '>', otherwise `reachable_first_row` is False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `reachable_second_row` remains True if `j` is 2 and `row1[j]` is '>', or if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', or if `j` equals `n - 1`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. `j` is 3**
