Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `results` is ['NO'], `j` is 1, `reachable_first_row` is False. If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**
