Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is True. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then no changes are made to the variables beyond `j` being equal to `n - 1` if `row2[j]` is '>'. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains False.**
