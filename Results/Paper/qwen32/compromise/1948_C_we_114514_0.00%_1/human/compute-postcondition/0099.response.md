The code snippet provided sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This assignment does not depend on any conditional checks or previous values of other variables, so it directly changes the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `j`, and the conditions for `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `j` is 3, `reachable_second_row` is True.**
