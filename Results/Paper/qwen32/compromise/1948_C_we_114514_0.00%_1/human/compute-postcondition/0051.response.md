The code snippet appends the string 'YES' to the `results` list. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is ['YES'], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True.**
