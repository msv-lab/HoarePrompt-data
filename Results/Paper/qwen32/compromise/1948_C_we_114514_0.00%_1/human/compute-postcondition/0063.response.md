Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` equals `n - 1`, and the current value of `row1[j]` is '>'**

In this output state, the only change is that `reachable_second_row` has been set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values.
