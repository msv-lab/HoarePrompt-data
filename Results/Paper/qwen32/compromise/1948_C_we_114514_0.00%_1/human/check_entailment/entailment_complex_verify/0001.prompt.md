You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>'. It returns a list of length `t` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether it is possible to reach the end of `row2` from the start of `row1` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement step by step to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Understanding:
The robot starts in cell (1, 1) and can move in four directions (left, right, down, or up). However, it always moves in one direction first and then follows the arrow in the cell it lands in. The goal is to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to attempt to solve the problem by iterating through each column of the grid and updating the reachability status of the robot for both rows. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes two boolean variables: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`.
   - `reachable_first_row` is set to `True` because the robot starts at (1, 1).
   - `reachable_second_row` is set to `False` initially.

2. **Iteration through Columns**:
   - For each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`, the program checks the reachability status.
   - If the robot can reach the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If it is the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n)).
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - It sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` (since the robot cannot move further to the left in the first row).
       - If it is not the last column and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If the robot can reach the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If it is the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (which is already true).

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - After iterating through all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

### Issues in the Program:
The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement. Specifically:
- The program does not account for the possibility of the robot moving up or down between the two rows.
- It incorrectly assumes that once the robot can reach the second row, it will always be able to move to the next column in the second row if the arrow points right. However, the robot could be forced to move back to the first row due to left-pointing arrows and then get stuck.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for all possible configurations of arrows. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
