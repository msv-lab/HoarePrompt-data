Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Let's analyze the code and identify a potential issue.

1. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it immediately returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists. This is correct because the Manhattan value is always even for any permutation.
   - It calculates `max_k`, the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists. This is also correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function attempts to construct a permutation with the specified Manhattan value `k`.
   - It starts with the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates through the permutation in reverse order, adjusting elements to increase the Manhattan value.
   - The logic for adjusting elements and calculating the Manhattan value is complex and involves helper functions `func_2` and `func_3`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the permutation to increase the Manhattan value by a specific amount `k`.
   - It swaps the element at position `-c` with the element at position `-c - k`.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the permutation to increase the Manhattan value.
   - It swaps the element at position `-c` with the element at position `c - 1`.

However, the logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is not straightforward and may not handle all edge cases correctly. Let's consider a specific test case where the program might fail:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 2
```
- For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the program should output a permutation with a Manhattan value of 2.
- The correct permutation could be `[2, 1, 3]`, which has a Manhattan value of `|2 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2`.

However, the provided program might not correctly generate this permutation or any other valid permutation for `k = 2`. The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is complex and may not cover all possible scenarios to generate a valid permutation for every possible `k`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases correctly, as demonstrated by the test case above.

Correctness: **False**
