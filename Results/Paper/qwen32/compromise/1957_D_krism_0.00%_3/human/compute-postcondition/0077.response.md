The value of `y` is assigned the value of `arr[i - 1]`. The values of `t`, `ans`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remain unchanged. The output state includes the new value of `y` and the unchanged values of `t`, `ans`, and the condition on `n`.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`**.
