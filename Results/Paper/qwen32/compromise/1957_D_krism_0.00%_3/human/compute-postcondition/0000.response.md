The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a string of dashes. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` which are used in the context of multiple test cases, but they are not referenced in the provided print statement.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
     - `a` is a list of `n` integers, each within the range 1 to \(10^9\).
   - The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet simply prints a string of dashes: `'-----------------'`.

3. **Output**:
   - Since the print statement does not reference any variables or objects from the initial state, the output is solely dependent on the string provided in the print statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is exactly the string of dashes provided.

Output: **-----------------**
