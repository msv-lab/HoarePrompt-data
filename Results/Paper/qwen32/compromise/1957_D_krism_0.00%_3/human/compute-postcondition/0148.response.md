The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. If `j` is less than 32, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `j + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `3 * (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `j` is `j + 1`**
