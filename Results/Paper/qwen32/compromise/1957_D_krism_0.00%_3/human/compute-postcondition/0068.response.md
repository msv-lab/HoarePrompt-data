The code snippet `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. This means that the count of how many times the j-th bit of `cur` was 1 across all 32 iterations, plus 2, is now increased by 1.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, `cur`, `i`, and `j` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is [0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)], `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to [1, 0], `cur` is `prefix[i]`, `i` is `i`, `j` is 2, `suf[j][1]` is the count of how many times the j-th bit of `cur` was 1 across all 32 iterations + 3.**
