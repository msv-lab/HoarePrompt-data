The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` is within the range of 0 to 31 (inclusive). Therefore, before the loop starts, `j` must be initialized to 0, which is the starting point of the range.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `j` is 0**
