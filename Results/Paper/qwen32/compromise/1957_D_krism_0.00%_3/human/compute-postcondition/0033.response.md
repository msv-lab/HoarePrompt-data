The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 32. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`. `cur` is `prefix[i]`, and `j` is 2. If the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, then the first sublist of `suf` is updated to `[0, 1]` if it was `[0, 0]` before. Otherwise, `suf[1][0]` is incremented by 1.**

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`. `cur` is `prefix[i]`, and `j` is 2.**
