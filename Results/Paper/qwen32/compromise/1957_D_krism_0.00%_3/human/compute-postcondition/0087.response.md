Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `j` is 0, the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1, `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `suf[j][0]` is now one less than it was before, while all other variables remain unchanged.
