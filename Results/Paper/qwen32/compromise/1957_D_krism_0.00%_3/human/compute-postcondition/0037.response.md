Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`. `cur` is `prefix[i]`, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` is the count of how many times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0 across all iterations, and `suf[j][1]` is the count of how many times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1 across all iterations.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `suf` will have been updated to reflect the number of times each bit position (from 0 to 31) was 0 or 1 in the binary representation of `cur` during each iteration of the loop. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `pre` remain unchanged, and `cur` retains its value from the last iteration.
