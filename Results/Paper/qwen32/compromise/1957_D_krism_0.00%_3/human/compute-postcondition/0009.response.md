The code appends the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` to the `prefix` list. Given the initial state, `prefix` is `[0, v, 0]`, so `prefix[-1]` is `0`. Therefore, `v ^ prefix[-1]` simplifies to `v ^ 0`, which is `v` because any number XORed with 0 remains unchanged.

Thus, the `prefix` list will now be `[0, v, 0, v]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line and must have at least 1 more integer, `prefix` is `[0, v, 0, v]`, `v` is the next element in `arr`**.
