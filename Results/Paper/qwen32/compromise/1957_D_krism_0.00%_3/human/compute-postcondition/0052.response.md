Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`, `cur` is `prefix[i - 1]`, `i` is `i - 1`, `j` is `j + 1` and `j < 32`, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` remains an input integer greater than 0, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^9, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` remains the same list of prefix XOR values, `pre` remains a list of 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`, `cur` remains `prefix[i - 1]`, `i` remains `i - 1`, `j` is now `j + 1` and still less than 32, and the first element of the `j`-th sublist in `suf` is incremented by 1.
