The code assigns a new value to the variable `k`, which is `y.bit_length() - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`.**
