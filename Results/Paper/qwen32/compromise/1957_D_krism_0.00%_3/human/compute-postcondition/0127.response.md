Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `2 * (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `j` is 2. If `c >> j & 1` is true, then `pre[2][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[2][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[2][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[2][0]` is decremented by 1.**
