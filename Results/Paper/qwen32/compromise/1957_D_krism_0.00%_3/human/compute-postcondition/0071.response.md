Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is [0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)], `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to [1, 0], `cur` is `prefix[i]`, `i` is `i`, `j` is 31. If the j-th bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is the count of how many times the j-th bit of `cur` was 1 across all 32 iterations + 32. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is the count of how many times the j-th bit of `cur` was 0 across all 32 iterations + 32.`**

### Explanation:
The loop iterates 32 times, examining each bit position from 0 to 31 of the `cur` value. For each bit position `j`, it increments either `suf[j][0]` or `suf[j][1]` based on whether the j-th bit of `cur` is 0 or 1, respectively. 

After 32 iterations, `j` will have reached 31, and each bit position from 0 to 31 will have been checked exactly once. Therefore, the count of how many times each bit was 0 or 1 across all iterations will be updated accordingly. 

The final output state reflects this, with `j` being 31, and `suf[j][0]` or `suf[j][1]` incremented by 32 for the corresponding bit positions in `cur`.
