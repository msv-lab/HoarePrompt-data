The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 32. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `2 * (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `j` is 2**
