The code snippet `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the second element of the `j`-th sublist in the `suf` list by 1. Given that `j` is initialized to 1, this means the second element of the first sublist in `suf` will be incremented by 1.

From the initial state, we know:
- `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`.

The impact of the code is that `suf[1][1]` will be incremented from 0 to 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`. `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, where the first sublist is `[1, 1]` and the rest are `[1, 0]`. `cur` is `prefix[i]`, and `j` is 1.**
