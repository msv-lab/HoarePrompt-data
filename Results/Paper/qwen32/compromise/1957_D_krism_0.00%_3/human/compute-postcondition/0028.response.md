Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`. If the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, then the `j`-th sublist of `suf` is updated to `[0, 1]` if it was `[0, 0]` before. If the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is set to 1. `cur` is `prefix[i]`, and `j` is 0.**
