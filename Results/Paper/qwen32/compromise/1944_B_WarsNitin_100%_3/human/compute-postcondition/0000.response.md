`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `a`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋; `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50,000.**
