The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means the initial values of `n` and `k` provided in the Initial State are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.**
