Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is either `[]` or `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1]]`, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, `ans2` is `[]`, `k` is either twice the second integer read from the input or twice the second integer read from the input minus 2, and `req` is equal to `k`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `l` is either `[b[0]]` or `[b[0], b[n - 1]]`. Otherwise, `l` is either `[]` or `[b[n - 1]]`. If `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, then `l` includes `b[n - 1]` and `ans1` is `[]`, `k` is twice the second integer read from the input. If `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`, then `ans1` is `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1]]`, `k` is twice the second integer read from the input minus 2.**
