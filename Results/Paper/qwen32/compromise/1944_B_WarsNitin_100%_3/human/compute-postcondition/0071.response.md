Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `ans1` contains repeated elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not the first or last element if they are not equal to their adjacent elements, `i` is 4. If `c[4]` is equal to `c[3]`, `k` is -2 and `ans2` includes `c[4]`. Otherwise, `k` remains 0 and `ans2` remains unchanged.**
