The code snippet sorts the list `c`. After executing the code, the list `c` will be in ascending order. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`.**
