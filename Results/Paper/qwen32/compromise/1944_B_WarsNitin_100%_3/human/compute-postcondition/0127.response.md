The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. 

Given the initial state, `ans1` can be either `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1], b[i]]` or `[b[i]]`. After appending `b[i]` to `ans1`, the new state of `ans1` will be:

- If `ans1` was initially `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1], b[i]]`, it will now be `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1], b[i], b[i]]`.
- If `ans1` was initially `[b[i]]`, it will now be `[b[i], b[i]]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is either `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1], b[i], b[i]]` or `[b[i], b[i]]`, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, `ans2` is `[]`, `k` is either 0 or twice the second integer read from the input minus 2, and `l` is determined based on conditions involving `b`.**
