Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then outputs two lists of integers, `ans1` and `ans2`, each containing `k` integers selected from the first `n` and the last `n` integers of the list `a`, respectively, following specific rules to ensure that pairs of equal integers are included when possible.**
