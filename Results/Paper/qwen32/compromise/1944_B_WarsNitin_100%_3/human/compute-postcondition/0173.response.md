The code appends the element at index `i` of list `c` to the list `ans2`. The value of `i` is `i + 2` from the initial state, and `n` remains unchanged. The condition `if k == 0` does not affect the execution of the given line of code, so it is not relevant here.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` remains the same, `ans2` has an additional element which is `c[i]`.**
