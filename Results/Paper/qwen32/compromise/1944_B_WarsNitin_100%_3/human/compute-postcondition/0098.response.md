The code snippet `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `ans1` contains repeated elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, plus `l[n-1]`, plus `l[n]`, plus `l[n + 1]`, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is `n + 1`, and `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop ends, plus `l[n-1]`, plus `l[n]`, plus `l[n + 1]`. `k` is decreased by 1.**
