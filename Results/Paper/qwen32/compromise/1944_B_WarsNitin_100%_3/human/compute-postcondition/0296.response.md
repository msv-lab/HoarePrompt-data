To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans1)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and analyze the relevant variables:

1. **`t`**: An integer between 1 and 5000. Its specific value does not affect the current print statement.
2. **`q`**: Set to 2. This value is not directly used in the print statement.
3. **`n`**: An integer greater than 2. It defines the split point for the list `a`.
4. **`a`**: A list of integers read from the input.
5. **`b`**: The first `n` elements of `a`, sorted in ascending order.
6. **`c`**: The sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, sorted in ascending order.
7. **`ans1`**: Contains all pairs of equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` reaches 0 plus the first three elements of `l`.
8. **`req`**: Twice the second integer read from the input. Not used in the print statement.
9. **`i`**: Set to 2. Not used in the print statement.
10. **`ans2`**: Contains all pairs of consecutive equal elements found in `c` until `k` reaches 0 plus the first three elements of `l`.
11. **`k`**: Set to -3. This value determines how many pairs are added to `ans1` and `ans2`.
12. **`l`**: Contains at least one unique element from `b` that is not part of any pair.

Given the above, let's focus on `ans1`:

- `ans1` includes all pairs of equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` reaches 0.
- Since `k` is initially set to -3, it means we need to add pairs of equal elements from `b` until `k` becomes 0. However, since `k` starts at -3, it implies that no pairs are added because `k` would already be non-positive before any pairs could be added.
- Additionally, `ans1` also includes the first three elements of `l`.

Thus, `ans1` will consist solely of the first three elements of `l`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*ans1)` statement will print the first three elements of `l`.

Output: **the first three elements of `l`**
