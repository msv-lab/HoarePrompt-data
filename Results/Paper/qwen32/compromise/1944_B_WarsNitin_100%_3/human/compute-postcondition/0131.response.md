The code snippet `l.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `l`. This means that the list `l` now includes the element `b[i]` at its new end.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `l`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is either `[]` or `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1]]`, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, `ans2` is `[]`, `k` is either 0 or twice the second integer read from the input minus 2, and `l` is determined based on conditions involving `b` with `b[i]` appended to it. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.**
