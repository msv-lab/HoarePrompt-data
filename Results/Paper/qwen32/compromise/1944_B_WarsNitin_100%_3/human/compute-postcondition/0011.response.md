The given code snippet assigns the value of `k` to a new variable `req`. No other variables are modified by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is twice the second integer read from the input, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input.**
