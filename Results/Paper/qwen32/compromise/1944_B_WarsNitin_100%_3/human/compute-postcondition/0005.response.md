The code assigns to `c` the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list. Given that `b` is defined as the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` will contain the remaining elements of `a` after the first `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`.**
