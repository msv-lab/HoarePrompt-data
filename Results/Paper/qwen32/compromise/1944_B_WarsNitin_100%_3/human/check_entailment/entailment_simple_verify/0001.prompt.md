You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input:** 
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has an integer `n` and `k`.
   - An array `a` of length `2n` where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice.

2. **Output:**
   - Two arrays `l` and `r`, each of length `2k`.
   - `l` should be a subset of the first half of `a` (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`).
   - `r` should be a subset of the second half of `a` (`a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, ..., a_{2n}`).
   - The bitwise XOR of elements in `l` should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

3. **Constraints:**
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`
   - `2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4`
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋`
   - Sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `5 · 10^4`.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Splitting the array `a` into two halves, `b` and `c`.
2. Sorting both halves.
3. Initializing empty lists `ans1` and `ans2` to store the elements of `l` and `r` respectively.
4. Checking for unique elements in the sorted halves and adding pairs of duplicate elements to `ans1` and `ans2` until `k` elements are added to each.
5. Adding remaining unique elements to `ans1` and `ans2` if needed.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans1` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans2`.
   - The program only considers pairs of duplicate elements and unique elements, but it doesn't guarantee that the final XOR values will match.
   
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program might fail for certain configurations of `a` where the straightforward approach of pairing duplicates doesn't yield a valid solution.
   - The program doesn't handle cases where the required elements cannot be directly found through simple sorting and pairing.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` will be equal. Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
