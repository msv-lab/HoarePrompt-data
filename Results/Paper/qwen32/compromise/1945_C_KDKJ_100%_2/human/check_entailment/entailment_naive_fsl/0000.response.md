Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program, particularly `func_1`, has a logical issue that can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the initial value of `ans` is set to `-1`, which is not a valid position for laying the road. The loop that determines the valid positions for laying the road does not update `ans` correctly if the first valid position found is `0`. As a result, if the first valid position is `0`, the function will incorrectly return `-1` instead of `0`.

### Problematic Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
000
```

### Expected Output:
```
0
```

### Actual Output:
```
-1
```

### Explanation of the Issue:
In the loop, `ans` is initialized to `-1`. When the loop checks the position `0`, it finds that the conditions are satisfied (`left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` are not true), but it does not update `ans` because `abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)` is not true for `-1`. Therefore, `ans` remains `-1` and is printed as the result.

### Suggested Fix:
Initialize `ans` to a value that ensures it will be updated correctly, such as `float('inf')`, and ensure that the first valid position is always considered.

Here's the corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        (x, y) = S[-1]
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        S.append([x, y])
    ans = float('inf')
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n + 1):
        left = S[i][0]
        lsum = i
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        rsum = n - i
        if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
            continue
        diff = abs(n / 2 - i)
        if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and i < ans):
            ans = i
            min_diff = diff
    print(ans)
```

This fix ensures that `ans` is updated correctly for the first valid position and that the smallest valid position is chosen when there are ties in the difference from the middle.
