The function reads a positive integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It calculates and prints an index `ans` that minimizes the absolute difference between the index and half of `n`, under the condition that the number of '0's on the left side of the index is at least half the length of the left side, and the number of '1's on the right side is at least half the length of the right side.
