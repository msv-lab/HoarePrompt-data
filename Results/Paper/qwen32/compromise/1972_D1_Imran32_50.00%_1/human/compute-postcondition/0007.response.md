Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it calculates a specific value `ans` based on the input `n` and prints this value. The calculation involves iterating up to the square root of `n` and adjusting `ans` by adding the integer division of `n + i` by `i * i` for each `i` from 2 up to the square root of `n`.**
