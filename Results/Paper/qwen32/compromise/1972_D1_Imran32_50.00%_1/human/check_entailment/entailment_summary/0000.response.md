Reasoning:  
The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the given code snippet does not implement this logic. Instead, it calculates a value `ans` based on the input `n` and prints this value for each test case. The calculation in the code does not involve `m`, gcd, or any checks related to the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
