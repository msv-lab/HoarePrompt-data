Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program does not seem to implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of what the program does:

1. It reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
3. Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (note that the variable name `k` is used instead of `m`).
4. It initializes `ans` to `n`.
5. It calculates `root` as the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1.
6. It iterates from `2` to `root + 1`:
   - For each `i`, it calculates `cnt` as `i * i`.
   - It increments `ans` by the integer division of `(n + i)` by `cnt`.
7. It prints `ans`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not use the second input `m` at all (it reads it as `k` but never uses it).
- The logic inside the loop does not seem to relate to the problem's condition that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The program does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) to check the condition.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here's a correct implementation outline:
1. For each test case, read `n` and `m`.
2. Initialize a counter to 0.
3. Iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
4. For each `a`, iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
5. For each pair \((a, b)\), check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
6. If the condition is satisfied, increment the counter.
7. Print the counter for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
