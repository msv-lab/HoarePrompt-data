Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not implement the logic required to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem requirements:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
2. Inside `func_1`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) according to the problem statement).
3. The program then calculates `ans` as `n` and iterates over a range up to the square root of `n`, adding values to `ans` based on a specific formula.

The logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem requirements. Specifically:
- The problem requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) and verifying if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The provided code does not iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and does not compute the gcd or check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

Here is a counterexample to show the program's incorrectness:

Input:
```
1
2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```
Explanation:
- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
- For \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). 2 is a multiple of 1.
- For \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). 3 is a multiple of 1.
- For \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\). 4 is a multiple of 2.

However, the provided code will not produce the correct output for this input.

Thus, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem requirements.
