You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, where n is the length of the array a.
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)) :
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
            
        #State: `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, where n is the length of the array `a`. `s` is the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive, and `s` is less than or equal to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `ops` is a list that now includes the tuple `(l, r)` as its last element. The elements of `a` from index `l` to `r` are all set to `r - l + 1`.
    else :
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if (pos != l) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        #State: `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, where n is the length of the array `a`. `s` is the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `mx` is the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the array `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, then the current value of `pos` remains the index of the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`.
        if (pos != r) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
        #State: `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, where n is the length of the array `a`. `s` is the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `mx` is the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the array `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, then the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been executed, and `pos` remains the index of the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, then no further action is taken.
    #State: `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, where n is the length of the array `a`. If `s` (the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive) is less than or equal to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), then `ops` is a list that includes the tuple `(l, r)` as its last element and the elements of `a` from index `l` to `r` are all set to `r - l + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`, and `pos` is the index of `mx` in the array `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been executed, and `pos` remains the index of the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further action is taken.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two integer parameters `l` and `r`, where `0 <= l <= r < n` and `n` is the length of the array `a`. The function returns the maximum possible sum of a contiguous subarray within the range from index `l` to index `r` (inclusive).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
