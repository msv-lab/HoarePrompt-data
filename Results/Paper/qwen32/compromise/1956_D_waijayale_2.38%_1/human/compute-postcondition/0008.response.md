The code snippet finds the index of the maximum value `mx` in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]` and adds `l` to it to get the position of `mx` in the original array `a`. 

Given the initial state, the variables `l`, `r`, `s`, and `mx` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `pos`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, where n is the length of the array `a`; `s` is the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1); `mx` is the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the array `a`.**
