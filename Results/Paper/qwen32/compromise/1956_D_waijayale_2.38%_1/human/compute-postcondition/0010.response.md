The code snippet calls a recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)`. This function call does not directly modify the variables `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` in the given initial state. Instead, it likely performs some operations internally that are not shown in the snippet. However, based on the given information, we can only deduce the state of the variables that are explicitly mentioned and not altered by the function call.

Since the function call does not change the values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` directly, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to these variables.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, where n is the length of the array `a`. `s` is the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `mx` is the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the array `a`. The current value of `pos` is not equal to `l`.**
