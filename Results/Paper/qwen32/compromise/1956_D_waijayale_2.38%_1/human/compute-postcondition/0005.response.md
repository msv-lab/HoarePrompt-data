To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates over a list of operations `ops`, where each operation is a pair of integers `(l, r)`. For each operation, it prints `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.

The loop modifies nothing beyond printing values. Therefore, the values of `a`, `n`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged after the loop execution. The only change is in the output due to the print statements.

Output State: **The values of `a`, `n`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged. The output consists of printed pairs `(l + 1, r + 1)` for each `(l, r)` in `ops`.**
