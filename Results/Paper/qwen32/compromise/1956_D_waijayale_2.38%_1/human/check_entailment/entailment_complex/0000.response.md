### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program and its functions to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function modifies the array `a` in a specific range `[l, r]`.
   - If `l == r`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 if it's not already 0.
   - If `l != r`, it recursively processes the subarray from `l+1` to `r`.
   - If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1` and records this operation in `ops`.
   - This function seems to be designed to ensure that all elements in a given range are set to the MEX of that range if necessary.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with the full range of the array.
   - It then returns the sum of the array `a`, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - This function orchestrates the process of maximizing the array sum using `recursive_maximize_sum`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function recursively processes subarrays of `a`.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of its length, it sets all elements in that subarray to `r - l + 1` (which is the MEX of the subarray).
   - If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays on either side of that maximum element.
   - This function is crucial for maximizing the sum of the array by ensuring that segments of the array are set to their MEX values when beneficial.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and prints the results.
   - It handles the input/output operations and ensures that the operations are printed in the required format.

### Analysis:
- The program is designed to maximize the sum of the array by setting segments of the array to their MEX values.
- The recursive approach ensures that the program considers all subarrays and makes the necessary modifications.
- The operations are recorded and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array while adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
