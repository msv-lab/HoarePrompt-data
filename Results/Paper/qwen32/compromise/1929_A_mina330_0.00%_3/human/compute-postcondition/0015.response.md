The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` is updated to whatever integer is provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ntest` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `ntest` â‰¤ 500, `itest` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[1] + ... + a[len(a) - (len(a) // 2)] - a[len(a) // 2 - 1]`, `i` is `len(a) // 2`**
