### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap:
Given an integer `n` which represents the sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters in the alphabet, we need to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have produced this sum.

#### Key Points:
1. **Lexicographical Order**: To ensure the word is lexicographically smallest, we should try to use the smallest possible letters first.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum `n` is calculated as the sum of the positions of the three letters in the alphabet.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` representing the encoded value.

2. **Constructing the Word**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes an empty array `arr`.
   - It then enters a loop to fill the first two elements of `arr`:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it again appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts the array `arr` to ensure the smallest possible letters come first.
   - It converts the values in `arr` to their corresponding letters and constructs the word.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the constructed word.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic for Constructing the Array**:
  - The program incorrectly handles the construction of the array `arr`. Specifically, it does not ensure that the sum of the elements in `arr` equals `lex` while maintaining the smallest possible values.
  - For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might append `[1, 1, 22]` instead of `[1, 1, 22]` or `[1, 2, 21]`, but it does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest combination.
- **Sorting the Array**:
  - Sorting the array after constructing it may not always yield the lexicographically smallest word because the initial construction logic is flawed.

#### Correct Approach:
- A more straightforward approach would be to start with the smallest possible letters and incrementally increase them while ensuring their sum equals `lex`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic for constructing the array and ensuring the lexicographically smallest word, the provided program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all cases.

**Correctness: False**
