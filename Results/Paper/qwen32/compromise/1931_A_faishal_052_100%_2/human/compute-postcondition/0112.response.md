Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 1. If `lex` was originally less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 27` if `lex < 52` or `lex - 28` if `lex >= 52`, and `arr` is `[1, 26]`. If `lex` was originally between 28 and 51, `lex` is now `lex - 52`, and `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If `lex` was originally between 52 and 78, `lex` is now `lex - 52` if `lex < 52` or `lex - 104` if `lex >= 52`, and `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If `lex` was originally greater than 78, `lex` is now `lex - 104`, and `arr` is `[26]`.**
