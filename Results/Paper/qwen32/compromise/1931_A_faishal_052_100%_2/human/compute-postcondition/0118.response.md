The code snippet provided modifies the value of the variable `lex` by subtracting 26 from its current value. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is to the `lex` variable. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 2, `arr` has `26` appended to it, `lex` is `lex - 26`.**
