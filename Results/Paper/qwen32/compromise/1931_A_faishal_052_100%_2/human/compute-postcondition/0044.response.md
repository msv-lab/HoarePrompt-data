The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's assume it was `i-1` before being incremented), `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by `arr`, and `arr` contains up to two elements in non-decreasing order, and `lex` is reduced by up to 52.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value. The value of `cases` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `cases` should remain the same as long as `i` is still less than `cases`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by `arr`, `arr` contains up to two elements in non-decreasing order, and `lex` is reduced by up to 52, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by `arr`, `arr` contains up to two elements in non-decreasing order, and `lex` is reduced by up to 52, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration**.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the last iteration isn't specified, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by `arr`, `arr` contains up to two elements in non-decreasing order, and `lex` is reduced by up to 52, `i` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity, let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` is `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by `arr`, `arr` contains up to two elements in non-decreasing order, and `lex` is reduced by up to 52, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration**.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, we can simply state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by `arr`, `arr` contains up to two elements in non-decreasing order, and `lex` is reduced by up to 52, `i` is incremented by 1**

Final simplified State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by `arr`, `arr` contains up to two elements in non-decreasing order, and `lex` is reduced by up to 52, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since `i` is incremented by 1, we can write the final state as:
