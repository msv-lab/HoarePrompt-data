The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Given that `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` will be in the range of 2 to 26. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is an integer such that 2 ≤ lex < 26, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is [26]**
