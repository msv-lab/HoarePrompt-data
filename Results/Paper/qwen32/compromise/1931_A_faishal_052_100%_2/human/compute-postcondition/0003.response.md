Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `arr` is initialized as an empty list. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `cases`, and `info`) remain unchanged.
