The code modifies the value of `temp` by appending another character to it. The new character is determined by taking the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`. Given that `i` is 4 and `j` is 3, the new character is derived from `info[4][3] + 96`.

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is `chr(info[4][2] + 96) + chr(info[4][3] + 96)`; `j` is 3; `i` is 4; `cases` must be greater than 4.**

In natural language, the output state is: `info` remains a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`. The value of `temp` is now the concatenation of two characters: the first is determined by `info[4][2] + 96`, and the second is determined by `info[4][3] + 96`. The values of `j`, `i`, and the condition that `cases` must be greater than 4 remain unchanged.
