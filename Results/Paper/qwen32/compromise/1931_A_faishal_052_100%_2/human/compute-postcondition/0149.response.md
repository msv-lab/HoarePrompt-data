To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

- `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`. This means `info` is a list where each element is a sorted array.
- `temp` is a string constructed from the characters corresponding to ASCII values derived from the elements of the fourth array in `info` (since indexing starts at 0, `info[3]` refers to the fourth array).
- Specifically, `temp` is constructed as follows:
  - `chr(info[3][0] + 96)` converts the first element of the fourth array in `info` to a character. Adding 96 to the element assumes that the element is a number between 1 and 26, which corresponds to the lowercase letters 'a' through 'z'.
  - `chr(info[3][1] + 96)` does the same for the second element.
  - `chr(info[3][2] + 96)` does the same for the third element.
- `j` is set to 2 and `i` is set to 3, but these variables are not used in the `print(temp)` statement.
- `cases` must be greater than 3, ensuring that `info` has at least four arrays.

Given this information, the output of `print(temp)` will be a string composed of three characters derived from the first three elements of the fourth array in `info`.

Let's denote the elements of `info[3]` as `info[3][0]`, `info[3][1]`, and `info[3][2]`. The characters in `temp` will be:
- `chr(info[3][0] + 96)`
- `chr(info[3][1] + 96)`
- `chr(info[3][2] + 96)`

Since the exact values of `info[3][0]`, `info[3][1]`, and `info[3][2]` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these elements.

Output: **temp (where temp is the string formed by chr(info[3][0] + 96), chr(info[3][1] + 96), and chr(info[3][2] + 96))**
