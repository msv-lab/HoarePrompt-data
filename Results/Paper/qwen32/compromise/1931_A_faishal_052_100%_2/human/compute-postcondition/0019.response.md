Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, and `lex` is an integer. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` contains the integer 1. If `lex` was initially 28 or more, `arr` contains the integer 26 if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `arr` remains an empty list.**
