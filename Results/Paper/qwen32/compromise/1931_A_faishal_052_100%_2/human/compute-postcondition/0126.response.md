The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `arr` list, which is now sorted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr` with `lex` appended, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 2, `arr` is sorted in ascending order.**
