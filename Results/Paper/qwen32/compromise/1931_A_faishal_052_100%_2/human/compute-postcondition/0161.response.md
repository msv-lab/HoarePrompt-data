Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and `n` (an integer for each test case representing some value, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the value of `n` for each case.**
