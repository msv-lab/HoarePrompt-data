Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 0, `arr` is `[1]`, `lex` is an input integer and `lex` is less than 28.**

Natural Language Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the list `arr` now contains one element, which is `1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
