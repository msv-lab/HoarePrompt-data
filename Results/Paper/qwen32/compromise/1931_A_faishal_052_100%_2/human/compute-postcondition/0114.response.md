The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, but since the loop condition checks if `j` is less than 2, the loop will not execute again if `j` is set to 2. However, to reflect the state right before the next (non-executing) iteration, we keep `j` as 2.

Therefore, the state right before the loop attempts to execute again would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 2**
