Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, and `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 26 with the current value of `lex` being less than or equal to 52.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `lex` has been decreased by 26, so if `lex` was initially between 52 and 78 (inclusive), it is now between 26 and 52 (inclusive). All other variables remain unchanged.
