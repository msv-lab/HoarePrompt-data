The code snippet takes the character at index `j` from the array at index `i` in the list `info`, adds 96 to its value (which corresponds to converting a 1-based alphabetical index to its ASCII value), and appends the resulting character to the string `temp`. 

Given that `i` is 3 and `j` is 0, the character appended to `temp` is determined by `info[3][0] + 96`. Since `info` contains sorted arrays and `cases` must be greater than 3, the specific value of `info[3][0]` is unknown but it will be a positive integer.

Let's denote the value of `info[3][0]` as `val`. Therefore, the character added to `temp` will be `chr(val + 96)`.

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is a string containing the character `chr(info[3][0] + 96)`; `j` is 0; `i` is 3, `cases` must be greater than 3.**
