The given code snippet attempts to append the value `1` to a list named `arr`. However, the initial state does not include a definition or initialization of `arr`. Assuming there was a typo and `arr` was intended to be `info` (since `info` is the only list mentioned in the initial state), the value `1` would be appended to `info`.

Given this assumption, the updated state of `info` would be `[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is [1], `j` is 2**.
