Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 0, `arr` is `[26]`, `lex` is an input integer, `lex` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26, so if `lex` was initially between 28 and 51 (inclusive), after the operation, `lex` will be between 2 and 25 (inclusive). All other variables remain unchanged.
