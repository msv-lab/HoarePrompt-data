The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Given that `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 28 but less than 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` will now be greater than or equal to 2 but less than 26.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, and `lex` is an integer such that 2 ≤ lex < 26.**
