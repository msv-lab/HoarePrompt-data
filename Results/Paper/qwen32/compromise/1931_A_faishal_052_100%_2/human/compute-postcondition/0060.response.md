Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 26 but less than or equal to 52, then `arr` is [26]. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list.**
