Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer, `arr` contains the integer 1, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code appends the integer 1 to the list `arr`. Since the initial state specifies that `arr` could contain different values based on the initial value of `lex`, the new state of `arr` is simply that it contains the integer 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
