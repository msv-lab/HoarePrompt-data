The code appends a new character to the `temp` string. This character is derived from the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3 and `j` is 2, so the character appended to `temp` is `chr(info[3][2] + 96)`. The values of `info`, `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[3][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[3][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[3][2] + 96)`; `j` is 2; `i` is 3, `cases` must be greater than 3.**
