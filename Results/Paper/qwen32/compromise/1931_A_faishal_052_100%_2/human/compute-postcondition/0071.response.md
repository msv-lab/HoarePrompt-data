Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 1. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is [1, 1] if `lex < 26`, otherwise `arr` is [26, 1]. If `lex` was initially between 26 and 52, `arr` is [26, 26] if `lex < 52`, otherwise `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex - 26` is in the range -25 to 1, [26, 26] if `lex - 26` is in the range 0 to 26, and [26] if `lex - 26` is greater than 52. If `lex` was initially greater than 52 but less than or equal to 78, `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex - 26` is in the range -25 to 1, [26, 26] if `lex - 26` is in the range 0 to 26, and [26] if `lex - 26` is greater than 52. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list.**
