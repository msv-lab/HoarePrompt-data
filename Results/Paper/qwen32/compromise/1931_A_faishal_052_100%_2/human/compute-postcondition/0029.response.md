Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` contains the integer 1. If `lex` was initially between 28 and 51, `lex` is now `lex - 26` and `arr` contains the integer 26. If `lex` was initially 52 or more, `lex` is now `lex - 26` (if `lex` was initially less than or equal to 78) and `arr` contains [26] if `lex` was exactly 52, or `arr` remains unchanged as an empty list if `lex` was greater than 78.**
