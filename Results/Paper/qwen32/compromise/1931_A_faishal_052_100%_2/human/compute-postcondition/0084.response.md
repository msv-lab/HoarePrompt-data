Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78
- `cases` is greater than 0
- `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `j` is 2
- `arr` is updated based on the value of `lex` as follows:
  - If `lex` was originally less than 29, `arr` is now `[1, 1, lex - 2]`
  - If `lex` was originally 29 or greater but less than 52, `arr` is now `[26, 1, lex - 27]`
  - If `lex` was originally 52 or greater but less than 78, `arr` is now `[26, 26, lex - 52]`
  - If `lex` was originally 78 or greater, `arr` is now `[lex]`

Code Snippet:
```python
arr.sort()
```

This line sorts the array `arr` in ascending order.

### Impact on `arr`:
- If `lex < 29`, `arr` was `[1, 1, lex - 2]`. Sorting this array does not change its order because it is already sorted.
- If `29 <= lex < 52`, `arr` was `[26, 1, lex - 27]`. Sorting this array results in `[1, 26, lex - 27]`.
- If `52 <= lex < 78`, `arr` was `[26, 26, lex - 52]`. Sorting this array does not change its order because it is already sorted.
- If `lex >= 78`, `arr` was `[lex]`. Sorting a single-element array does not change it.

### Output State:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` remains an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78
- `cases` remains greater than 0
- `info` remains unchanged (contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`)
- `i` remains `i + 1`
- `j` remains 2
- `arr` is sorted as described above

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 2, `arr` is sorted as follows: if `lex < 29`, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`; if `29 <= lex < 52`, `arr` is `[1, 26, lex - 27]`; if `52 <= lex < 78`, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`; if `lex >= 78`, `arr` is `[lex]`.**
