The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is `[1]`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains `[]`.**
