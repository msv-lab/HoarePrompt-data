Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 1, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and `arr` is `[1, 26]` if `lex` was less than 28, `[26, 26]` if `lex` was between 28 and 78 (inclusive), or `[26]` if `lex` was greater than 78.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `arr` depends on the new value of `lex` after the subtraction.
