Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is [1, 26]. If `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 26 but less than or equal to 52, `arr` is [26, 26]. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list, `j` is 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `arr` has been updated by appending 26 to it. The conditions for `lex` and the resulting `arr` values remain as specified, with `arr` now including the additional element 26. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
