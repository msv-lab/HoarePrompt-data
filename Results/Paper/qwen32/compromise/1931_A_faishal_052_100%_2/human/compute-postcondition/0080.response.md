Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 2. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` now includes an additional element `26` at the end, and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` is 52 or greater but less than or equal to 78, `arr` has an additional element `26` appended to it and `lex` is reduced by 26.**
