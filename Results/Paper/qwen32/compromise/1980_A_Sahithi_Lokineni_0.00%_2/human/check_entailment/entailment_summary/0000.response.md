Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. The logic involves counting the occurrences of each difficulty level in the given problems and then calculating how many more problems are needed to meet the requirement for each difficulty level across the specified number of rounds.

However, there are a few issues with the code:

1. The function `default_value` is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will lead to a `NameError` when the `defaultdict` tries to use it.
2. The logic for calculating `ans` is incorrect. The current logic adds up the difference between `m` and the count of each difficulty level if the count is less than or equal to `m`. This is not correct because it doesn't account for the fact that each round needs one problem of each difficulty level. Instead, it should calculate the total number of problems needed for all rounds and then subtract the number of problems already available for each difficulty level.
3. The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the program, and its definition does not affect the correctness of the main logic. However, its presence does not contribute to the functionality of the program.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
