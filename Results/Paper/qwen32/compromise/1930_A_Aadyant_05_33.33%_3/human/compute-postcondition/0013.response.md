The code snippet appends the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` to `list2`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, we need to account for the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` and the newly appended integer value of `list1[2 * (i + 1)]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from `b`, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the string input provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The output state is that `num` remains the same, `out` is still an empty list, `list2` now includes an additional element which is the integer value of the substring at position `2 * (i + 1)` in `list1`, `list1` remains sorted and composed of substrings from `b`, `a` is still greater than or equal to 1, `b` remains the user-provided string input, and `i` has been incremented by 1.
