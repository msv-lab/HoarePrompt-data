The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `out`. This action does not affect the value of `num` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `out` list.

Output State: **`num` is assigned the value of `input()`, which is a string representing the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000); `out` is an empty list.**
