The code snippet `list1.sort()` sorts the list `list1` in ascending order. The other variables (`num`, `out`, `list2`, `a`, `b`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is the string input provided by the user.**
