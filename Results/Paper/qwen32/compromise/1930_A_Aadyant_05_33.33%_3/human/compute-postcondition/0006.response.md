The value of `a` is converted from a string to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is an empty list, `a` is an integer.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is an empty list, `a` is an integer**.
