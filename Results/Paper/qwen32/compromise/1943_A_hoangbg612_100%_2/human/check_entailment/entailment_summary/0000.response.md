### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements. The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob have played optimally.

1. **Sorting and Counting:**
   - The program starts by sorting the input array `N`. This step is crucial because it allows the program to determine the smallest missing non-negative integer efficiently.
   - It then iterates through the sorted array to build a dictionary `M` where `M[k]` represents the count of the integer `k` in the array `N`.

2. **Determining the MEX:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1 and is used to track the current maximum integer that has been encountered in the sorted array.
   - As the program iterates through the sorted array, it updates `cur` to the current number if it is greater than `cur` and checks if there is a gap (i.e., `num > cur + 1`). If a gap is found, it sets `cur` to `cur + 1` and breaks out of the loop because this is the smallest missing non-negative integer.
   - If no gap is found and the current number is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S` (the length of the array). If they are equal, it means all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present in the array, so it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys in `M` that have a count of 1. This list is supposed to help determine the smallest missing integer if there are multiple occurrences of the same integer in the array.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `cur` as the final result for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for determining `cur` is flawed. Specifically, the part where it checks if the sum of counts equals `S` and increments `cur` by 1 is incorrect. This logic does not correctly handle cases where the MEX is not simply the highest number in the array plus one.
- The part where it checks the `cnt` list and sets `cur` to `cnt[1]` is also incorrect. This logic does not correctly determine the MEX in all cases.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
