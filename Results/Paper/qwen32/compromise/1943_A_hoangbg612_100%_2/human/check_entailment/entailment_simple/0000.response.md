### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This step is necessary for the logic that follows, as it helps in determining the smallest missing element in a sorted manner.

3. **Dictionary `M` and Variable `cur`:**
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in the array.
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1` and is used to track the current smallest number that hasn't been fully used yet.

4. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted array `N`. For each number `num`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks out of the loop. This is because `cur + 1` would be the smallest non-negative integer not in the array up to that point.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`, it sets `cur` to `num` and increments its count in `M`.
     - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it simply increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

5. **Final Check on `cur`:**
   - After the loop, if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S` (i.e., all elements in `N` have been counted), it increments `cur` by 1. This ensures that if all elements from `0` to `cur` are present, `cur + 1` is the MEX.

6. **Handling the Case with Multiple Single Elements:**
   - The program creates a list `cnt` of elements that appear exactly once in `N`.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`. This step seems to be an attempt to handle a specific case but is not clear why it is necessary or correct.

7. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `cur`, which is supposed to be the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Analysis of the Program's Logic:

- **Sorting and Counting:** The sorting and counting mechanism is correct for identifying the smallest missing element.
- **Handling the Sum of Counts:** The check `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S` is correct to determine if all elements from `0` to `cur` are present.
- **Handling Multiple Single Elements:** The logic involving `cnt` is unclear and doesn't seem to be necessary for determining the MEX. It seems to be an unnecessary step that could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `4\n0 0 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program correctly identifies that the MEX is `2`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `4\n0 1 2 3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly identifies that the MEX is `1`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `2\n1 1`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly identifies that the MEX is `0`.

However, the handling of `cnt` is unnecessary and could lead to incorrect results in other cases. For example, if the array is `[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`, the program might incorrectly set `cur` to `2` instead of `4`.

### Conclusion:

The program is mostly correct for the provided test cases but has an unnecessary and potentially incorrect step involving `cnt`. This step should be removed to ensure correctness for all cases.

**Correctness: False**
