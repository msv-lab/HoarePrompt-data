Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players (Alice and Bob) play optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the size of the array `n` and the array `N`.
3. Sorting the array `N`.
4. Iterating through the sorted array to determine the MEX (`cur`).

### Function Summary
The function summary states that the function processes multiple test cases, reads an integer `S` and a list of integers `N`, and determines a value `cur` based on the sorted list `N` and the integer `S`. The final output for each test case is the value of `cur`.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array is not necessary for calculating the MEX. Instead, using a frequency counter is more appropriate.
2. **Counting and MEX Calculation**: The code attempts to calculate the MEX by iterating through the sorted array and keeping track of the current MEX (`cur`). However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple numbers have the same count, and it does not account for the alternating turns of Alice and Bob.
3. **Handling Multiple Occurrences**: The code does not correctly handle cases where multiple numbers have the same count. For example, if there are multiple numbers that appear exactly once, the code does not correctly determine the second smallest such number, which could be the correct MEX.
4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when all numbers are the same or when the array contains only one element.

### Verification with the Provided Input
Let's verify the code with the provided input examples:

**Input:**
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
0
```

**Actual Output from the Provided Program:**
```
2
1
0
```

The code seems to produce the correct output for the provided examples, but this does not guarantee its correctness for all possible cases.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve:
1. Counting the frequency of each number in the array.
2. Simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
3. Calculating the MEX based on the final state of the array `c`.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not implement the optimal strategy for both players. While it produces the correct output for the given examples, it is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.
