To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally according to the rules of the game.

Let's break down the program and check if it aligns with the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob:

1. **Sorting**: The input array `N` is sorted. This is not necessary for the optimal strategy and might be misleading or unnecessary in the context of the problem.

2. **Tracking MEX**: The program initializes `cur` to -1 and uses a dictionary `M` to count occurrences of each number in the array `N`. It then iterates through the sorted array, updating `cur` to the smallest number that hasn't been seen yet (or the next number in sequence if the current number is greater than `cur + 1`). If a number is seen more than once, it increments the count for that number in `M`.

3. **Checking Full Array**: After processing the array, the program checks if all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present in `M` by comparing the sum of values in `M` to `S` (the length of the array). If they are, it increments `cur` by 1.

4. **Handling Single Occurrences**: The program creates a list `cnt` of numbers that appear exactly once in `M`. If there are at least two such numbers, it sets `cur` to the second smallest of these numbers.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints `cur`, which it considers as the MEX of the final array `c`.

However, there are several issues with this approach:

- **Optimal Strategy**: The program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The program simply counts occurrences and attempts to deduce the MEX without simulating the turns.

- **Handling Duplicates**: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are duplicates. For example, if the array has multiple 0s and 1s, the program might incorrectly assume that the MEX is higher than it actually is.

- **MEX Calculation**: The program's logic for calculating the MEX is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns to build the array `c`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the final score of the game if both players play optimally.

**Correctness: False**
