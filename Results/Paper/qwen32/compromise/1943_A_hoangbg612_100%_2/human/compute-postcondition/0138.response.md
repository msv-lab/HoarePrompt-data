The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of the element in the dictionary `M` at the key `cur` by 1. Other variables (`N`, `T`, `S`, `num`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is the input integer, `num` is the next element in `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
