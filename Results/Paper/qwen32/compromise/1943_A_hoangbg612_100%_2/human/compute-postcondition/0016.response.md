The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` attempts to increment the count of the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Given that `cur` is initially -1, this operation will either add the key -1 to the dictionary with a value of 1 if it does not already exist, or increment the existing value by 1 if the key -1 is already present in `M`.

Since `cur` is -1 and `M` is initially an empty dictionary, the key -1 will be added to `M` with a value of 1.

The other variables (`T`, `n`, `a`, `S`, `N`, `num`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cur` is -1, `M` is a dictionary with the key -1 having a value of 1, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`.**
