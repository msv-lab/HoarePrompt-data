The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Given the initial state, `cur` is `num`, so the key `num` in the dictionary `M` is now assigned the value `1`.

Since `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of `1`, after the assignment, `cnt` will include `num` if it was not already present. However, the problem statement does not specify the initial contents of `M`, so we can only assume that `num` is now in `cnt` after this operation.

The other variables (`N`, `S`, `T`, and `num`) remain unchanged. The condition `if num is greater than cur + 1` and the subsequent `break` statement are not executed because this code snippet does not contain any conditional logic or loops.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `cur` is `num`, `M` is a dictionary with `num` as a key having the value `1`, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is a list containing `num` (and possibly other keys from `M` that have a value of `1`), `T` remains unchanged, and `num` is greater than `cur`.**
