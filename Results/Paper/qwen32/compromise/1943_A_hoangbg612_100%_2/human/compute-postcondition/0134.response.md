Output State: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is the input integer, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The list `N` still contains at least one element, `T` has not changed, `S` remains the input integer, `num` is still the next element in `N`, and `cur` has been increased by 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
