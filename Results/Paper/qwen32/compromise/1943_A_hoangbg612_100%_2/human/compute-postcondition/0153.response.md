The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. Given that `k` is 2, this means 2 will be added to the end of the `cnt` list. 

Initial State: `N` is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]; `cur` is 3 if the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains 2; `M` is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; `cnt` is [2, 2] if `M[k]` is 1 for the current key `k`, otherwise `cnt` remains []; `S` is the input integer; `T` remains unchanged; `k` is 2

After executing the code `cnt.append(k)`, the value of `cnt` changes from [2, 2] to [2, 2, 2].

Output State: **`N` is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]; `cur` is 3 if the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains 2; `M` is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; `cnt` is [2, 2, 2]; `S` is the input integer; `T` remains unchanged; `k` is 2**
