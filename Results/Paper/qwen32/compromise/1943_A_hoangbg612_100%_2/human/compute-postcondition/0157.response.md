The value of `cur` is updated to the value of `cnt[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5], `cur` is `cnt[1]`, `M` is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `S` is the input integer, `T` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]; `cur` is `cnt[1]`; `M` is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2; `S` is the input integer; `T` remains unchanged.**
