Postcondition: **`cur` is the highest value in `N` that does not cause a break condition, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the sum of all values in `M`, and `cnt` is a list. If `M[k]` is 1, then `cnt` includes the element `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list. `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after the previous `k`.**
