The code `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The variable `cur` is equal to `num`, which is the next element in the list `N`. The values of `N`, `T`, `S`, `num`, and `cur` remain unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is the input integer, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, and `M[cur]` is 1.**
