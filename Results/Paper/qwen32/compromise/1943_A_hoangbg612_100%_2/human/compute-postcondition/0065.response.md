Postcondition: **`cur` is either 0 or -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer, and `num` is greater than `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.**
