Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is sorted in ascending order; `cur` is -1; `M` is {}; `S` is the input integer; `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1; `T` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, and `S` is the input integer. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`, `M` is a dictionary with `num` as a key having the value `1`, and `cnt` is a list containing `num` (and possibly other keys from `M` that have a value of `1`). If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, then `cur` remains -1, `M` is {-1: 1}, and `cnt` is [-1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is the input integer, `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is the input integer, `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
