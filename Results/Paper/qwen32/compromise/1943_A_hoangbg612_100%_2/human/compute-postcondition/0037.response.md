Postcondition: **`cur` is the highest value in `N` that does not cause a break condition, and `M` is a dictionary with counts of how many times each value of `cur` was encountered or incremented. If the sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
