Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is either `num` or -1, `M` is a dictionary with either `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than `cur`, or `{-1: 1}` if `num` is less than or equal to `cur`. `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, and `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is either `num` or -1, `M` is a dictionary where if `num > cur`, `M` is `{num: 1}`; if `cur` is `num` after the else, `M` is `{num: 2}`; if `cur` is `-1` after the else, `M` is `{-1: 2}`. `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two integers, and `num` is the next integer in the list `N`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is either `num` or -1. If `num > cur`, `M` is `{num: 1}`. If `num <= cur`, `M` is `{num: 2}` if `cur` becomes `num`, or `M` is `{-1: 3}` if `cur` becomes -1. `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two integers, and `num` is the next integer in the list `N`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
