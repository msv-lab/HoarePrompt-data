The code snippet `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `cur` is now the same as the value of `num`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is the input integer, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is now equal to `num`.**
