The given line of code `M[cur] = 1` updates the dictionary `M` by setting the value associated with the key `cur` to 1. Initially, `M` has a key `-1` with a value of `1`. After executing the code, `M` will have an additional key `cur` with a value of `1`. The values of `T`, `n`, `a`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is `num_next`, `cur` is `num_next`, `M` is a dictionary with keys `-1` and `cur`, both having values of 1.**
