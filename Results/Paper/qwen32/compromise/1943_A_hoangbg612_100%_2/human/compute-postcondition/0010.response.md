The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` was -1, so the new value of `cur` is 0. The values of other variables (`T`, `n`, `a`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and `M`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cur` is 0, `num` is greater than 0, `num` is greater than 1 (i.e., `num` is at least 1), `M` is an empty dictionary.**
