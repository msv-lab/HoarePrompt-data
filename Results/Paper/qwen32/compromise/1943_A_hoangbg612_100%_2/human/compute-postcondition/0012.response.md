Postcondition: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is set to 0 and `num` is at least 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `cur` and `num` remain unchanged. `M` is an empty dictionary.**
