Postcondition: **`cur` is the second element in `cnt` if the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` and values as their respective counts, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1, `T` remains unchanged, and `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**
