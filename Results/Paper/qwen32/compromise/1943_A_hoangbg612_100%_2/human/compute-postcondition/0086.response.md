Postcondition: **`cur` is either `num` or -1. If `num > cur`, `M` is `{num: 1}`. If `num <= cur`, `M` is `{num: 2}` if `cur` becomes `num`, or `M` is `{-1: 3}` if `cur` becomes -1. `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two integers, and `num` is the next integer in the list `N`.**
