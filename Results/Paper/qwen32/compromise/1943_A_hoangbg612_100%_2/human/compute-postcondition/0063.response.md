Output State: **`cur` is 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer. The current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1` and therefore greater than 1.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` was incremented by 1, changing it from -1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
