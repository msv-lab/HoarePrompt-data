The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two integers, `M[cur]` is `1`.**
