The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `numbers` starting from the second element (index 1). 

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the current element from `numbers[1:]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be the next element in the list `numbers`.

Let's denote the current value of `num` as `numbers[i]`. Since the loop starts from `numbers[1:]`, the next value for `num` should be `numbers[i+1]`.

Given that `numbers` has at least two elements, the next iteration will take the next element from the list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20); `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, `num` is the next element in `numbers`**.

To be more specific, if `num` was `numbers[1]` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `num` will be `numbers[2]`, and so on.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20); `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, `num` is `numbers[2]`**.

However, since we don't know the exact index of `num` from the previous iteration, the most general form of the state would be:

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20); `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, `num` is the next element in `numbers` after the current `num`**. 

But for the sake of the format, we can denote it as:

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20); `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, `num` is `numbers[i+1]` where `i` is the current index in the iteration**.

Since we are only adjusting the state of `num` and we don't have the exact index, we can simply denote the next element in the list:

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20); `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, `num` is the next element in `numbers`**.

For clarity, if we assume the previous `num` was `numbers[1]`, then:

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20); `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, `num` is `numbers[2]`**.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20); `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, `num` is the next element in `numbers`**.

Given the format, we can specify:

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20); `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, `num` is `numbers[2]`**.
