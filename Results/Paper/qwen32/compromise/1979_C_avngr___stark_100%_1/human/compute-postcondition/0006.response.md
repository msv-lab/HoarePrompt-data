To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the variables provided. The code snippet `result = func_1(result, num)` indicates that the function `func_1` is called with `result` and `num` as arguments, and the result of this function call is assigned back to `result`.

Given the initial state:
- `numbers` is a list of integers with at least three elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20).
- `num` is `numbers[3]`.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`.

The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine the exact computation it performs. However, we can describe the output state based on the given information and the fact that `result` is being reassigned.

Since `num` is specifically `numbers[3]`, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, after executing the code snippet, `result` will hold the new value returned by `func_1` when called with the current `result` and `num`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least three elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20); `num` is `numbers[3]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)` after the function call.**
