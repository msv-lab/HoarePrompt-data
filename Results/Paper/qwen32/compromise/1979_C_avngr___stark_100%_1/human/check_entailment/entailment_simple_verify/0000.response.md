Let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to distribute bets on `n` outcomes in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back if any one of the outcomes wins. The amount received back is the bet on the winning outcome multiplied by its respective multiplier `k_i`.

### Code Analysis:
The code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` using the functions `func_1` and `func_2`. It then distributes the bets such that the bet on the i-th outcome is `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM of the multipliers. 

### Annotations Recap:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Computes the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.
- **Main Logic**: 
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.
  - It calculates the LCM `m` of the multipliers.
  - It computes the bets `c[i]` as `m // k[i]`.
  - It checks if the sum of the bets is less than `m`. If not, it outputs `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it outputs the bets.

### Reasoning:
The key idea here is to use the LCM to ensure that the distribution of bets meets the requirement. Let's break it down:

1. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers ensures that for each outcome, the bet can be distributed in a way that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received if that outcome wins.
2. **Bet Distribution**: By setting `c[i] = m // k[i]`, we ensure that if the i-th outcome wins, the received amount is `k[i] * c[i] = k[i] * (m // k[i]) = m`, which is strictly greater than the total bet `sum(c)`, because `sum(c) = sum(m // k[i]) < m` (since `m` is the smallest number that is divisible by all `k_i`).

### Validation:
Let's validate this with the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - `n = 3`, `k = [3, 2, 7]`
  - `m = lcm(3, 2, 7) = 42`
  - Bets: `c = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
  - Total bet: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41 < 42`
  - Output: `14 21 6` (or any permutation that maintains the condition)

- **Test Case 2**:
  - `n = 2`, `k = [3, 3]`
  - `m = lcm(3, 3) = 3`
  - Bets: `c = [3 // 3, 3 // 3] = [1, 1]`
  - Total bet: `1 + 1 = 2 < 3`
  - Output: `1 1`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - `n = 5`, `k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - `m = lcm(5, 5, 5, 5, 5) = 5`
  - Bets: `c = [5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Total bet: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`, which is not less than 5.
  - Output: `-1`

The code correctly handles these cases, and the logic is sound.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect. The provided code does correctly address the problem description by using the LCM to distribute the bets in a way that satisfies the given conditions.

**Final: True**
