To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to distribute coins (bets) on `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the coins received back for each possible winning outcome. If the i-th outcome wins, you receive back `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome. 

### Solution Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:

1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
2. **func_2(numbers)**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

However, the program does not directly provide a solution to the problem. It calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k_i`, but it does not generate the bets `x_i` that satisfy the required conditions.

### Required Solution:
To solve the problem, we need to find a way to distribute the bets `x_i` such that:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \forall i \]
This inequality can be rearranged to:
\[ x_i < \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{k_i - 1} \quad \forall i \]

One way to achieve this is to set `x_i` such that the sum of all bets is minimized while still satisfying the inequality. A common approach is to set:
\[ x_i = \text{LCM}(k_1 - 1, k_2 - 1, \ldots, k_n - 1) \]
Then, for each `i`, set:
\[ x_i = \frac{\text{LCM}(k_1 - 1, k_2 - 1, \ldots, k_n - 1)}{k_i - 1} \]

This ensures that:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \text{LCM}(k_1 - 1, k_2 - 1, \ldots, k_n - 1) \]
and:
\[ k_i \cdot x_i = k_i \cdot \frac{\text{LCM}(k_1 - 1, k_2 - 1, \ldots, k_n - 1)}{k_i - 1} \]
Since `k_i - 1` is a divisor of the LCM, `k_i \cdot x_i` is strictly greater than the total sum of bets.

### Conclusion:
The provided program calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k_i`, but it does not generate the bets `x_i` as described. Therefore, the program is not correct for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
