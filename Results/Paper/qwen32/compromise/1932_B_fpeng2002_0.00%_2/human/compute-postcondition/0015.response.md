The value of `num_tests` is decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, and `start_year` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `num_tests` is greater than 0 minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, `start_year` is the result of the loop's final calculation.**
