To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`. The variable `nums` is mentioned to remain unchanged, so we only need to adjust `x` and the dependent variable `start_year`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is `x + 1`
- `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[x + 1] + 1) * nums[x + 1]`
- `nums` remains unchanged

The loop iterates over `x` in the range from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `x` at the end of the previous iteration as `x_end`. At the start of the next iteration, `x` will be `x_end`, which is `x + 1` from the previous iteration. However, since we are starting a new iteration, `x` should be the next value in the sequence, which is `x_end + 1` or simply `x + 2` from the initial value of `x` at the start of the previous iteration.

Now, we need to calculate `start_year` for this new value of `x`. The formula for `start_year` is:
\[ \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\text{start\_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[x + 1] + 1\right) * \text{nums}[x + 1] \]

Since `x` is now `x + 1` from the previous iteration, the new value of `start_year` will be calculated using `nums[x + 2]` (because `x` is incremented by 1 at the start of the new iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `x` is `x + 1` (from the end of the previous iteration, this is the start of the new iteration)
- `start_year` is calculated using the new value of `x` in the formula provided
- `nums` remains unchanged

State: **`x` is `x + 1`, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[x + 2] + 1) * nums[x + 2]`, `nums` remains unchanged**
