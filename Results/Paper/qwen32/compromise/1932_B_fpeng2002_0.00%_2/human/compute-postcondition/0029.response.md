The code snippet provided only takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variables `start_year` and `num_tests` are not modified by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `n` and the unchanged values of `start_year` and `num_tests`.

Output State: **`start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last number in `nums` that is greater than the cumulative effect of all previous iterations, effectively the least common multiple (LCM) of all numbers in `nums` adjusted by the loop's logic, and `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`; `n` is an input integer.**
