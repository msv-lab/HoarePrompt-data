Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n`, `k` are integers where `k` is greater than 0 and `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[i]`, `ans2` retains its initial value, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is further updated to `ans1 - a[i + x] * 2`.**
