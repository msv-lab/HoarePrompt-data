The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The values of `ans1`, `ans2`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of the elements from position `x` to `k+x-1` (if within bounds); `ans2` retains its initial value; `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input.**
