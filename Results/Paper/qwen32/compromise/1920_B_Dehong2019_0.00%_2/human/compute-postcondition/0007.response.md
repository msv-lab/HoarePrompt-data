The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` from `ans1`. Given that `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and `ans1` is initially the sum of all elements in the list `a`, the value of `ans1` will decrease by twice the value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k` are integers obtained from the input, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order obtained from the input, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus `a[i] * 2`.**
