The value of `ans2` is updated to be equal to `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans2` now holds this same value.

Output State: **`ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `a` are the integers read from the input with `a` sorted in descending order.**
