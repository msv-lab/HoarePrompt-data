Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k` are integers obtained from the input, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order obtained from the input, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans2` has been set to be equal to the value of `ans1`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
