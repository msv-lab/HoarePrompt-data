Postcondition: **`T` is `T-1`, `cur` is either -1 (if `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`) or 0 (if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`), `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, and `num` is greater than `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
