To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `T` (number of test cases) is given and greater than 0.
   - `S` (input integer) is given.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
   - `cur` starts at -1.
   - `M` is an empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each `num` in `N`.
   - If `num > cur`, it checks if `num > cur + 1`. If true, it sets `cur` to `cur + 1` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `num <= cur + 1`, it sets `cur` to `num` and adds `num` to the dictionary `M` with a value of 1 if `num` is not already a key in `M`. If `num` is already a key, it increments the value by 1.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `num > cur + 1` or all elements in `N` have been processed.

**Final Output State**:
- `T` remains unchanged.
- `S` remains unchanged.
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `cur` will be the value of the last `num` processed in the loop.
- `M` will contain keys for all unique `num` values encountered in `N` that are less than or equal to `cur + 1`, with the values representing the count of each `num`.

Given the loop's behavior, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `cur` will be the maximum value in `N` that is part of the contiguous sequence starting from the initial `cur` value of -1.
- `M` will contain the count of each integer in the contiguous sequence from -1 to `cur`.

**Output State: **T** is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; **S** is an input integer; **N** is a sorted list of integers in ascending order; **cur** is the maximum value in **N** that is part of the contiguous sequence starting from -1; **M** is a dictionary containing the count of each integer in the contiguous sequence from -1 to **cur**.**

In simple terms:
- `cur` will be the largest number in `N` that is part of the sequence starting from 0 (since `cur` starts at -1).
- `M` will have entries for each number in that sequence, with the count of how many times each number appears in `N`.

Output State: **T** is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; **S** is an input integer; **N** is a sorted list of integers in ascending order; **cur** is the maximum value in **N** that is part of the contiguous sequence starting from -1; **M** is a dictionary containing the count of each integer in the contiguous sequence from -1 to **cur**.
