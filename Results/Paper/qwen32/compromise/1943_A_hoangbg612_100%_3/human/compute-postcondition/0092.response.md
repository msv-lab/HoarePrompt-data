To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over the keys of the dictionary `M`. Therefore, the state of `M` is the primary concern here.

Given the loop:
```python
for k in M.keys():
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if `M` has at least one key. The variables `cur` and `cnt` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, since `cur` and `cnt` are mentioned in the initial state, we should ensure that their states are consistent with the problem description.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. **`M`**: The loop will execute if `M` has at least one key. Therefore, `M` should not be an empty dictionary.
2. **`cur`**: The description states that `cur` is increased by 1 if the sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`. However, since we are only concerned with the loop execution, the value of `cur` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.
3. **`cnt`**: Similarly, `cnt` is mentioned as an empty list, and since it is not part of the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `M` has at least one key.

State: **`M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `cur` is an integer (its value does not affect loop execution), `cnt` is an empty list**
