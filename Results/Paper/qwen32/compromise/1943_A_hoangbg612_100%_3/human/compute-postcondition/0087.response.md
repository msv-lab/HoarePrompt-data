To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables `T`, `cur`, `S`, `M`, and `N` change.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is `T-1` (unchanged throughout the loop).
   - `cur` is `-1`.
   - `S` is an input integer (unchanged throughout the loop).
   - `M` is an empty dictionary.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input.

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop iterates over each `num` in the sorted list `N`.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to `1`.
   - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - `T` remains `T-1`.
   - `S` remains the input integer.
   - `N` remains the sorted list of integers from the input.
   - `cur` will be the last value of `num` that was processed by the loop.
   - `M` will be a dictionary where keys are the unique values from `N` and values are the counts of each unique value in `N`.

Given this, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `T` is `T-1` (unchanged).
- `S` is the input integer (unchanged).
- `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input (unchanged).
- `cur` will be the last element of `N`.
- `M` will be a dictionary with keys as the unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts.

**Output State:** **`T` is `T-1`, `cur` is the last element of `N`, `S` is the input integer, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their counts, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, `cur` will be the last element of the sorted list `N`, and `M` will contain the count of each unique element in `N`. The other variables `T` and `S` remain unchanged.
