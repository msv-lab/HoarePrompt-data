The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which iterates over the elements of the list `N`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `N` to contain at least one element.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `num`**: This variable will take on the value of each element in the list `N` during each iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute at least once, `N` must contain at least one element.
2. **Variable `N`**: This is the list that `num` will iterate over. Since `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input, we need to ensure that it contains at least one integer for the loop to execute.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted so that `N` has at least one element. The other variables (`M`, `cur`, `cnt`, `T`, and `S`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is -1, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` where the value is 1 (which is an empty list since `M` is empty), `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer**.
