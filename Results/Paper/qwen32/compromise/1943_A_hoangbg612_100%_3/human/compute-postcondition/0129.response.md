The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. This means that the dictionary `M` will now have an entry where the key is the current value of `cur` and the value is `1`.

No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with an additional entry `cur: 1`, `cur` is the value of `num`, `cnt` is a list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer, and `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur`.**
