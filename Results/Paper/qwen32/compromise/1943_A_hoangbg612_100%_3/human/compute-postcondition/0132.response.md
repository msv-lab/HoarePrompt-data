The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If `N` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last element processed from the list `N`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `N` to be processed. Therefore, `num` should be the next element in `N`.

State: **`M` is a dictionary, `cur` is an integer, `cnt` is a list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least two integers, and `num` is the next element in `N`**.
