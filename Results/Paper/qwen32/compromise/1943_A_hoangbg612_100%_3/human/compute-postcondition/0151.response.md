Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. `cur` is the last integer in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last integer in `N`. If `M[k] == 1`, `cnt` is a list containing the previous elements of `cnt` plus `k`. `T` is decremented by 1. `S` is the input integer. `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input. `k` is the next key in `M.keys()`.**
