The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the innermost loop or if statement that it is contained within. This action does not alter the values of any variables; it only affects the control flow of the program. Therefore, the values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
