The only object in the loop head is the variable `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the keys in the dictionary `M`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` would have been the last key in `M.keys()`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another key in `M` that has not yet been iterated over. Therefore, `k` should be set to the next key in `M.keys()`.

State: **`M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `cur` is the last integer in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last integer in `N`, `cnt` is a list containing `k` if `M[k]` is equal to 1, otherwise `cnt` is an empty list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is the input integer, and `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input, `k` is the next key in `M.keys()`**
