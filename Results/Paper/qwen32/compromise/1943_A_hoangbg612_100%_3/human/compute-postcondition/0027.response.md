The code snippet provided increments the value of `cur` by 1. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `num`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N`; `cur` is increased by 1.**
