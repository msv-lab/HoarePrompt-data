The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `num`. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`) remain unchanged. Since `num` is the next element in the sorted list `N`, and the condition related to `cur` being incremented and the loop being broken is not evaluated in the provided code snippet, `cur` simply takes the value of `num`.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is `num`.**
