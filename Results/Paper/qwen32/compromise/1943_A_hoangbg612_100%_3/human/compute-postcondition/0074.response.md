Postcondition: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur`.**
