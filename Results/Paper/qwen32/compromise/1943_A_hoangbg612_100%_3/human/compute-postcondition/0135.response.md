Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary, `cur` is an integer, `cnt` is a list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least two integers, and `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur`.**
