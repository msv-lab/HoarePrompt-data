The only variable in the loop head is `num` and it is being iterated over the list `N`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in the list `N`.

Given:
- `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0.
- `S` is an input integer.
- `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element.
- `cur` is either -1 or the value of `num` if `num` was greater than `cur`.
- `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either `-1` or `cur` and the value is `1`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M` is updated to have `num` as the key with the value `1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1 and `M` has `-1` as the key with the value `1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the current element from the list `N`. To start the next iteration, `num` should be the next element in the list `N`.

Let's denote the current index of `num` in `N` as `idx`. After the previous iteration, `idx` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `num` should be `N[idx]`.

Since the state of `N` does not change, and we are only concerned with `num`, we need to identify the next element in `N` after the current `num`.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `cur` is either -1 or the value of `num` if `num` was greater than `cur`; `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either `-1` or `cur` and the value is `1`; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`.**

To be more precise, if `num` was `N[i]` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `num` should be `N[i+1]`.

Since we don't have the exact index `i` of `num` in `N`, we can only express the state in terms of the next element in `N` after `num`.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `cur` is either -1 or the value of `num` if `num` was greater than `cur`; `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either `-1` or `cur` and the value is `1`; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`.**
