Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `cur` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is greater than `cur`, and the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `T`, `cur`, `S`, `M`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged. We exit the most internal loop or if statement.
