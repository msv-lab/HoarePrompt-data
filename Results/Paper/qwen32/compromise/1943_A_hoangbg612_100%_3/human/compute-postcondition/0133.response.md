Output State: **`M` is a dictionary, `cur` is an integer incremented by 1, `cnt` is a list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least two integers, and `num` is the next element in `N`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `cur` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
