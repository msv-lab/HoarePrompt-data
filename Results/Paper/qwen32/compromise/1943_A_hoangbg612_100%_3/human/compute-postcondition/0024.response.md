The given code snippet `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either `-1` or `cur` and the value is `1`. After executing the code, the value associated with the key `cur` will be incremented by 1. 

Hereâ€™s the updated output state:

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `cur` is either -1 or the value of `num` if `num` was greater than `cur`; `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either `-1` or `cur` and the value is `2`; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`.**

This means that the value in the dictionary `M` associated with the key `cur` has been incremented from `1` to `2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
