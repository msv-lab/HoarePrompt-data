Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob have played optimally. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

Let's analyze the optimal strategies:
1. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
2. Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.

The optimal strategy for Alice is to append the smallest number that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX. Bob, on the other hand, will try to prevent Alice from doing this by removing the smallest number that Alice would pick next.

The MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game can be determined by counting the occurrences of each number in the array `a`. If the number of unique elements in `a` is less than `n`, then the MEX will be the smallest number not present in `a`. If all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are present in `a`, the MEX will be `n`.

The provided program does not correctly simulate this logic. It sorts the array and then tries to find the smallest number not present in the array, but it does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob. The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of both players and thus does not always produce the correct MEX.

Let's consider the third test case from the example:
- Input: `2\n1 1`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Program Output: `1`

The correct reasoning for this test case is:
- Alice picks `1`, `c = [1]`, `a = [1]`.
- Bob picks `1`, `c = [1]`, `a = []`.
- The MEX of `c` is `0`.

However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` for this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
