Output State: **`pathb` remains the same, `pb` remains the same, `vis` remains the same, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the last iteration, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`, `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `curr`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `i` is the smaller of `len(pathb)` and `k`, `paths` must have at least 1 element, `ps` remains the same, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `ress` is now the maximum value between its previous value and the value of `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
