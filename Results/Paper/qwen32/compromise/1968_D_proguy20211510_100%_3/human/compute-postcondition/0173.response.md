Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integer values from input such that `k` is at least `i + 1`, `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates, `ps` is the repeated node, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node and must have at least one element, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node and must have at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is the maximum value between the previous `ress` and `curr`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates, `pres` is the previous value of `pres` plus `paths[i]`, `i` is the smaller of `len(pathb)` and `k` plus 1, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
