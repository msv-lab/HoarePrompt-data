Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integer values from input; `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates; `ps` is the repeated node; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node and must have at least one element; `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1; `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations; `ress` is 0; `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is 0; `i` is the smaller of `len(pathb)` and `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integer values from input, `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates, `ps` is the repeated node, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node and must have at least one element, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node and must have at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is the maximum value between the previous `ress` and `curr`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates, `pres` is the previous value of `pres` plus `paths[i]`, `i` is the smaller of `len(pathb)` and `k`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the loop or the most internal block is exited, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integer values from input such that `k` is at least `i + 1`, `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates, `ps` is the repeated node, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node and must have at least one element, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node and must have at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is the maximum value between the previous `ress` and `curr`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates, `pres` is the previous value of `pres` plus `paths[i]`, `i` is the smaller of `len(pathb)` and `k` plus 1, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integer values from input such that `k` is at least `i + 1` unless `k < i + 1` in which case we break out of the loop or if statement, `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates, `ps` is the repeated node, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node and must have at least one element, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node and must have at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is the maximum value between the previous `ress` and `curr`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates, `pres` is the previous value of `pres` plus `paths[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `i = i + 1`), and `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. `ress` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `curr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
