The code snippet `paths.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the value `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. This means `paths` will now have an additional element at the end, which is `a[ps - 1]`.

Given the initial state, the variable `paths` already includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]` at the end. Therefore, executing this line of code will not change the state of `paths` further because the element is already present.

The other variables `pathb`, `pb`, `vis`, `preb`, `resb`, `ress`, `pres`, `i`, and `ps` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pathb` contains values from `a` corresponding to the nodes visited before the cycle, `pb` is the node that completes the cycle, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 0, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` and `ress` are the maximum values of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`, `paths` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`.**
