The code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, and `p` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input.**
