The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into four parts, which are then assigned to the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. Since `input().split()` splits the input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace, the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` will be strings. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer and `int(input())` returns `t`, but this value of `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is a string, `k` is a string, `pb` is a string, `ps` is a string.**
