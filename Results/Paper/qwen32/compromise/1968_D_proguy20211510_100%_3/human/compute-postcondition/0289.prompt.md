Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are positive integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; p is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive; a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; YES is 'YES'; NO is 'NO'; MOD is 1000000007; alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pathb, paths = [], []
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[pb - 1] = 1
    while True:
        pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
        if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
            break
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[ps - 1] = 1
    while True:
        paths.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]
        if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
            break
    resb, ress = 0, 0
    preb, pres = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(pathb)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
        preb += pathb[i]
        resb = max(resb, curr)
    for i in range(len(paths)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
        pres += paths[i]
        ress = max(ress, curr)
    if resb > ress:
        print('Bodya')
    elif ress > resb:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is the index of the first repeated element in the cycle; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integers from `a[initial ps - 1]` to `a[ps - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(paths), k) - 1`; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`; `i` is `min(len(paths), k)`. The final result is `resb` if `resb` is greater than `ress`, otherwise it is `ress`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integer values from input; `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates; `ps` is the repeated node; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node and must have at least one element; `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1; `resb` and `ress` are the maximum values of `curr` calculated during the iterations, where `resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`; `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`; `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `resb` remains the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations. Otherwise, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `pathb`, `pb`, `vis`, `preb`, `paths`, and `ps` remain the same. `i` is `min(len(paths), k)`. `ress` is the maximum `curr` value computed during the iterations. `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`. If `resb` was greater than `ress` before the if-else block, `resb` remains the same. Otherwise, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and `ress`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
