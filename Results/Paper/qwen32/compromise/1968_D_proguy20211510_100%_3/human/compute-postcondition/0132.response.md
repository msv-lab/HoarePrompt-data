The given code snippet appends the value of `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. This means that the list `paths` will now have an additional element at the end, which is the value of `a[ps - 1]`.

Since `vis[ps - 1]` is already 1, the condition `if vis[ps - 1] equals 1` is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This break statement does not affect the variables directly, but it does terminate the loop or if statement that this code is part of.

Here is the updated output state considering the changes made by the code snippet:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer value from input; `k` is the integer value from input; `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates (i.e., the repeated node); `ps` is the value of `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node; `paths` is a list containing the value `a[ps - 1]` and now has an additional element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(paths), k) - 1`; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`; `i` is `min(len(paths), k)`. The loop or if statement is broken out of because `vis[ps - 1]` equals 1.**
