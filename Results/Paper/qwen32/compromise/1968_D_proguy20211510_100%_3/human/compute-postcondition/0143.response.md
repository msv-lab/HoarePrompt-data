The provided code snippet initializes `preb` and `pres` to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, only `preb` and `pres` are updated in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer value from input; `k` is the integer value from input; `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates (i.e., the repeated node); `ps` is the repeated node; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node; `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1; `resb` is 0; `ress` is 0; `preb` is 0; `pres` is 0; `i` is `min(len(paths), k)`.**

In simple terms, `preb` and `pres` are both set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
