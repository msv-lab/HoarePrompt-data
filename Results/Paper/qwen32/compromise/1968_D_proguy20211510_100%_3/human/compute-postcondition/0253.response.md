Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains `i + 1` as the `break` statement does not affect the value of `i`. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is nested within, but it does not change the value of any variables, including `i`.
