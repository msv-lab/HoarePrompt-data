The code snippet `preb += pathb[i]` modifies the value of `preb` by adding `pathb[i]` to it. The other variables `i`, `k`, and `curr` are not modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 1`. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.
- `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`

After executing the line `preb += pathb[i]`, the new value of `preb` becomes `preb + pathb[i]`. The condition involving `i` and `k` remains unchanged, and `curr` is still defined as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`.**
