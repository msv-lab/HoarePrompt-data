In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates `int(input())` times, meaning it will execute once for each test case. Therefore, the critical factor for the loop to execute is the value returned by `int(input())`.

To ensure the loop executes, `int(input())` must be a positive integer. Given the problem statement, `t` (the number of test cases) is already described as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns this value `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `int(input())` returns `t`**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, once for each test case. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, `alpha`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.
