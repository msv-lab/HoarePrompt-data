Postcondition: **`pathb` remains the same, `pb` remains the same, `vis` remains the same, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the last iteration, `resb` is the maximum `curr` value computed during the iterations, `ress` remains 0, `pres` remains the same, `i` is the smaller of `len(pathb)` and `k`, `paths` must have at least 1 element, `ps` remains the same. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
