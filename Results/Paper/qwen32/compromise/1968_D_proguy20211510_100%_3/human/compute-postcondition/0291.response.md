Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, and two lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it determines the maximum possible score that two players, Bodya and Sasha, can achieve within `k` steps based on the values in `p` and `a`, starting from positions `P_B` and `P_S` respectively. It then prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal.**
