Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the players enter a loop in the permutation. Specifically, it calculates the score assuming the players will stay in the loop for the remaining turns, but it does not correctly account for the possibility of staying in a loop and maximizing the score within that loop.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Loop Detection**: The code correctly detects cycles in the permutation for both Bodya and Sasha.
2. **Score Calculation**: The code calculates the score for the initial part of the path before entering the loop but does not correctly handle the loop itself.
3. **Handling Loops**: The code does not consider the possibility of staying in a loop and maximizing the score within that loop. It simply calculates the score for the initial path and assumes the score remains the same for the remaining turns if the player stays in the loop.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4 10 1 2
2 3 4 1
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation:**
- Both players start in a loop: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1`.
- Each player scores `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10` in the first 4 turns.
- In the remaining 6 turns, they can stay in the loop and score `10` again.
- Total score for both players: `10 + 10 = 20`.
- The game is a draw.

**Actual Output:**
The code will likely output `Bodya` or `Sasha` because it does not correctly handle the loop and the score calculation within the loop.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Cycle Detection**: Detect the cycle for both players.
2. **Score Calculation**: Calculate the score for the initial path before entering the loop.
3. **Loop Handling**: Calculate the score for the loop and determine the maximum score a player can achieve by staying in the loop for the remaining turns.

The code needs to be modified to correctly handle the loop and maximize the score within the loop. Therefore, the correctness of the provided code is **False**.
