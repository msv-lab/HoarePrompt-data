Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description to find potential issues.

### Program Analysis:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
```

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if Alice and Bob are in positions where Alice can immediately win or Bob can immediately win, the program might not correctly identify this.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Moves:**
   - The program calculates `x` as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, which is the maximum number of moves Alice can make vertically towards Bob's row. However, the logic for determining the range of columns (`l` to `r`) and checking if Alice or Bob can win is flawed.
   
3. **Incorrect Logic for Winning Conditions:**
   - The program checks if Alice or Bob can win based on the range of columns (`l` to `r`) but does not correctly account for all possible moves and winning conditions.
   
4. **Incorrect Handling of Draw Conditions:**
   - The program incorrectly identifies draw conditions. For example, if Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, the program might not correctly identify this as a draw.

### Example Case:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
3 3 1 1 3 3
```

- **Expected Output:** "Draw"
- **Actual Output:** "Draw" (Correct)

However, let's consider another case:

```
1
3 3 1 1 2 2
```

- **Expected Output:** "Alice"
- **Actual Output:** "Draw" (Incorrect)

In this case, Alice can move to (2, 2) on her first turn and win the game. The program incorrectly identifies this as a draw.

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly the winning conditions and some edge cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
