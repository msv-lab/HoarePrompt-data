**Reasoning:**

The program aims to count the number of beautiful pairs in each test case. A pair (i, j) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The provided program uses a clever method to count these pairs efficiently by leveraging modular arithmetic.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
- For each test case, the program initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by \(x\) and \(y\) respectively.
- For each element `num` in the array:
  - It calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
  - It then checks how many elements seen so far have a remainder of `mod_x` when divided by \(x\) and a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by \(y\). These counts are added to `count`.
  - It updates the counts in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the current element.
- The program repeats this process for all test cases and returns the counts of beautiful pairs for each.

However, there is a critical issue in the calculation of `mod_x`. The line `mod_x = -num % x` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `mod_x = num % x` for both `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` because we need to check if there exists a previous number `a_j` such that:
- `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0` which implies `a_j % x == -a_i % x` or `a_j % x == (x - a_i % x) % x`.
- `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0` which implies `a_j % y == a_i % y`.

The correct calculation should be:
- `mod_x = num % x`
- `mod_x_complement = (x - mod_x) % x`
- `mod_y = num % y`

The program should check `mod_x_map` for `mod_x_complement` instead of `mod_x`.

**Correctness: False**

The program is incorrect because of the incorrect calculation of `mod_x`. The correct implementation should use the complement of `mod_x` when checking `mod_x_map`.

Here's the corrected part of the code:
```python
for num in arr:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_x_complement = (x - mod_x) % x
    mod_y = num % y
    count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x_complement, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
    mod_x_key = num % x
    mod_y_key = num % y
    mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
    mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
```

**Correctness: False**
