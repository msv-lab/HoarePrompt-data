The code snippet provided resets the `mod_x_map` dictionary to an empty dictionary. This means that any previous mappings stored in `mod_x_map` are lost, and it starts fresh as an empty dictionary. The values of other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_y_map`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `num % y` in `arr`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
