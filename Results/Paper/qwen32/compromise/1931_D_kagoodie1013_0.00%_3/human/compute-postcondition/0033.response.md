The provided code snippet initializes `mod_x_map` as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_y_map`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_y_key` across all elements in `arr`; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
