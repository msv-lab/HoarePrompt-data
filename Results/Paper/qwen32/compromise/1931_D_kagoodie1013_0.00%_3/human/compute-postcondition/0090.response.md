The code snippet appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. The values of `test_cases`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The `count` value is already described as `(n-1)n`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` which is `(n-1)n` and the previous values of `count` if any; `count` is `(n-1)n`; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys as `mod_x_key` values from `arr` and values as their respective counts; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys as `mod_y_key` values from `arr` and values as their respective counts; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
