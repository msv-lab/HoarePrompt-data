Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as the key and its value incremented by 1; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.**

In simpler terms, `mod_x_map` now has an entry for `mod_x_key` with its count incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state except for `mod_x_map`.
