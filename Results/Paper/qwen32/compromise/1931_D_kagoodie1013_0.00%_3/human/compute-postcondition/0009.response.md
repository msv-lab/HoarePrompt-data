The code snippet provided assigns `mod_x_key` the value of `num % x`. The initial state does not specify a value for `num`, but it is used in the calculation of `mod_x_key`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `mod_x_key`, which is now assigned the value of `num % x`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; `test_cases` must contain at least one valid tuple; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` is a list that must contain at least one element; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.**
