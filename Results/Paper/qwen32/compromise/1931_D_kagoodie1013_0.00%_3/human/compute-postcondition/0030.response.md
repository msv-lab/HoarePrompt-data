The given code snippet appends the value of `count` to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `results` will contain one element, which is the value of `count`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is the total number of valid pairs based on the modulo conditions; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_x_key` across all elements in `arr`; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_y_key` across all elements in `arr`.**
