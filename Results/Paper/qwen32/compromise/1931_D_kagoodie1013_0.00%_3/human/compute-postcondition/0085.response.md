The code snippet `mod_x_key = num % x` updates the value of `mod_x_key` to the result of `num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Given the initial state, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `x` is a value from the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `mod_x_key` is initially `num % x`. After the execution of the code snippet, `mod_x_key` will be recalculated as `num % x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any; `count` is 6; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 2; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases` where `arr` must have at least two elements; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`; `num` is the next element in `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.**
