The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `n` (each between 1 and 2 Â· 10^5). For each `n`, it calculates and prints a value based on a predefined sequence logic. The final state of the program is that it outputs the calculated values for each test case without modifying the input values.
