The code snippet initializes a new list `sum_values` with zeros, where the length of the list is `max(numbers) + 1`. This does not affect the initial variables `t`, `numbers`, or `values`. The new list `sum_values` is created with the specified length.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each corresponding to the input integer provided in each iteration of the loop; `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1`; `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1`.**
