Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Scope of `n`**: The variable `n` is used in the loop `for i in range(10, n + 1):`, but `n` is not defined in this scope. It should be `max(numbers)` instead of `n`.

2. **Initialization of `sum_values`**: The `sum_values` array should be initialized up to `max(numbers) + 1` for all test cases, not just the last one.

3. **Logic for calculating `values` and `sum_values`**: The logic for calculating `values` and `sum_values` should be inside the loop for each test case, or it should be correctly updating for all values up to the maximum `n` encountered in all test cases.

4. **Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called before its definition, which will result in a `NameError`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[-1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

This corrected program initializes `values` and `sum_values` up to the maximum `n` encountered in all test cases and correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number up to `max_n`. It also ensures the function is defined before it is called.
