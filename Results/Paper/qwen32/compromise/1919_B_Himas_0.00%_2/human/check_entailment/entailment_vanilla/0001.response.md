Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input**:
   - The input starts with the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, there is an integer `n` representing the length of the string `s`.
   - The string `s` consists of characters `+` and `-`.

2. **Conversion**:
   - Each `+` in the string `s` corresponds to `1` in the array `a`.
   - Each `-` in the string `s` corresponds to `-1` in the array `a`.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The task is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the sum of penalties `p(b_1) + p(b_2) + ... + p(b_k)` is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray `c` is defined as `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy to minimize the penalty is to group the `+`s and `-`s in such a way that the sum of each subarray is zero, because the penalty `|sum(c)| * len(c)` will be zero for any subarray with a sum of zero.
   - If it's not possible to have all subarrays with a sum of zero, we try to balance the counts of `+` and `-` as much as possible to minimize the absolute sum of each subarray.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        e = input()
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(P - M)
```

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` (which is not used in the program) and the string `s` itself.

2. **Counting `+` and `-`**:
   - The program counts the number of `+`s in the string `s` and stores it in `P`.
   - It counts the number of `-`s in the string `s` and stores it in `M`.

3. **Calculating the Penalty**:
   - The program prints the difference `P - M`.

### Correctness Evaluation

- The program does not follow the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty. It simply calculates the difference between the counts of `+` and `-` and prints it.
- The optimal strategy involves splitting the array into subarrays with sums as close to zero as possible, not just calculating the difference between counts of `+` and `-`.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the correct strategy for minimizing the penalty as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
