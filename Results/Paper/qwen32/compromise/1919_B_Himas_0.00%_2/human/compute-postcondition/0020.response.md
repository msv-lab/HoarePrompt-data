To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

Initial State:
- `P` is the number of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- `M` is the number of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(P - M)
```

To understand what will be printed, we need to break down the values of `P` and `M`:

1. **`P`**: This variable holds the count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
2. **`M`**: This variable holds the count of characters in the string `e` that are not '+'.

The expression `P - M` calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.

Since the exact string `e` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `P` and `M`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **P - M (where P is the number of '+' characters in the string `e` and M is the number of non-'+' characters in the string `e`)**
