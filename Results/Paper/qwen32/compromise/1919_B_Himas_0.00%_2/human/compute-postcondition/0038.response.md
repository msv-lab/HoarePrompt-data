The code `M += 1` increments the value of `M` by 1. Given the initial state, `M` is 0 if `q` equals '+', otherwise `M` is 2. Therefore, after the increment:

- If `q` equals '+', `M` was 0 and becomes 1.
- If `q` does not equal '+', `M` was 2 and becomes 3.

The values of `P`, `i`, `s`, and `e` remain unchanged. The character `q` also remains the same as it is the next character in the string `e` and is not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`P` is 2 if `q` equals '+', otherwise `P` is 0; `M` is 1 if `q` equals '+', otherwise `M` is 3; `i` is incremented by 1; `s` remains an input integer; `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters; `q` is the next character in the string `e`**.
