Output State: **`P` is 1 and `M` is 1 if `q` equals '+'. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2. `i` is incremented by 1, `s` remains an input integer, and `e` is a string that must have at least 1 character. `q` is the next character in the string `e`.**

Explanation: The value of `M` is incremented by 1. If `q` equals '+', `P` remains 1 and `M` becomes 1. If `q` does not equal '+', `P` remains 0 and `M` becomes 2. The other variables (`i`, `s`, `e`, and `q`) remain unchanged.
