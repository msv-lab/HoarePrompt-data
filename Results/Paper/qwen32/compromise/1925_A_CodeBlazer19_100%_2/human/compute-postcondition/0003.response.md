Functionality: **The function reads from standard input where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26) representing the length of the strings to be formed and the number of first lowercase English alphabets to be used, respectively. The function returns the number of distinct strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
