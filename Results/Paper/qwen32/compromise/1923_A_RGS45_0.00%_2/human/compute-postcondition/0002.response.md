To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration and how it affects the variables.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what the loop does:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` and a string `arr` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.

2. **Finding Positions of '1's:**
   - `x` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`.
   - `y` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of '1' when `arr` is reversed. This effectively gives the position of the last '1' in the original string (since reversing the string makes the last '1' the first '1' in the reversed string).

3. **Sub-string Extraction:**
   - `z` is assigned the sub-string of `arr` starting from the first '1' (index `x`) to the last '1' (index `n - y - 1`).

4. **Counting '0's:**
   - The code then counts the number of '0's in the sub-string `z` and prints this count.

After the loop has processed all `t` test cases, the only variables that have been modified are those within the scope of the loop (i.e., `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, `z`), and the output (which is printed but not stored in a variable).

Since the variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are local to each iteration of the loop, they do not retain their values between iterations. The only lasting effect is the printed output for each test case.

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the count of '0's in the sub-string between the first and last '1' for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` do not retain their values after the loop completes.**
