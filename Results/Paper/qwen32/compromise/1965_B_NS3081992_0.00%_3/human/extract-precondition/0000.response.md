Precondition: **The function `func_15` does not take any parameters directly. It relies on other functions (`func_10` and `func_14`) which are not provided in the snippet. However, based on the usage, `func_10` likely returns the number of test cases (t), and `func_14` likely processes each test case to determine the size of the sequence (m) and the sequence itself (a_i).**
