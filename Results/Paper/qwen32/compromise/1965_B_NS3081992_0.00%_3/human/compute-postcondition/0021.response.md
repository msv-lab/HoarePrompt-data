Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, and `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. If `k` equals 1, then `ans` is set to `[2, 3, 4, 8]`, `n` is set to 10, `b` is '1010', and `l` is 4. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.**
