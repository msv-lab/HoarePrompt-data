The code snippet appends the value of `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. The initial state describes `ans` as `[2, k - 3, k + 1]`. After appending the new value, `ans` will be `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.**
