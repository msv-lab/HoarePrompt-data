Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`. `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that at least one `arr[start_index + j]` was not equal to `j` for `j` in `range(i + 1)` if the if part was taken, or for `j` in `range(i)` if the else part was taken. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. If `arr[start_index + i]` was equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1, `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is set to `i - 1`, the list `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, and all elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` are set to `i - 1`.**
