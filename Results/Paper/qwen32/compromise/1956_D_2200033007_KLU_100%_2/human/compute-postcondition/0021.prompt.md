You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array arr, starting from the index start_index.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`; `is_already_stairs` is `False` if any `arr[start_index + j]` was not equal to `j` for `j` in `range(i + 1)`, otherwise `True`.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns nothing (None)
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`; `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that at least one `arr[start_index + j]` was not equal to `j` for `j` in `range(i + 1)`.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`; `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that at least one `arr[start_index + j]` was not equal to `j` for `j` in `range(i + 1)`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: `i` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`, decremented by 1; `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that at least one `arr[start_index + j]` was not equal to `j` for `j` in `range(i + 1)`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0, and `arr[start_index + i]` is now equal to `i`. The list `res` still includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, and all elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` are set to `i`.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`. `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that at least one `arr[start_index + j]` was not equal to `j` for `j` in `range(i + 1)` if the if part was taken, or for `j` in `range(i)` if the else part was taken. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. If `arr[start_index + i]` was equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1, `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is set to `i - 1`, the list `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, and all elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` are set to `i - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i`, which is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`. The function does not return anything (None) in either of the specified cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing (None)

Case_2: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
