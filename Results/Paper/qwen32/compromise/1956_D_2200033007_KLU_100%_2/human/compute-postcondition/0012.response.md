Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`. `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that at least one `arr[start_index + j]` was not equal to `j` for `j` in `range(i + 1)`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. The current value of `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.**

Natural Language: The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been executed, but the values of `i`, `arr`, `start_index`, and `is_already_stairs` remain unchanged as per the given initial state. The function call does not alter these variables directly.
