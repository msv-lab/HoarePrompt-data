Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates and returns the maximum value based on the subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index` in the array `arr`. It uses memoization with the dictionary `res_dict` to store and retrieve previously computed results for subarrays. The function handles three main cases: returning a cached result, returning the maximum of 1 and the single element in the subarray when `start_index` equals `end_index`, and computing the maximum value by considering different splits of the subarray and recursively calling itself.

The element at `arr[start_index]` is less than or equal to 0.

Furthermore, `arr[end_index] + func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` is not equal to `max_value`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two integer parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which define a range within an array `arr`. It returns a list of tuples representing indices that satisfy certain conditions based on the values in `arr` and the results of calls to another function `func_1`. The function handles different cases: if the range length is 1 and the element is non-positive, it returns an empty list; if the range length is 1 and the element is positive, it returns a list with a single tuple of that index; if the maximum value condition is met, it returns a list with a single tuple of the range; otherwise, it recursively divides the range and combines results from subranges.

Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0, and `arr[start_index + i]` is now equal to `i`. The list `res` still includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, and all elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` are set to `i`.

Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. If `arr[start_index + i]` was equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1, `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is set to `i - 1`, the list `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, and all elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` are set to `i - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_stairs` modifies the array `arr` by setting a sequence of elements starting from `start_index` to a specific pattern based on the value of `i`. It also appends tuples to the list `res` indicating the range of indices modified. The function does not return any value.
