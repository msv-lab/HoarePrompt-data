Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if there is at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match `t` while `c` does not.

To correctly solve the problem, for each position `i` in the strings, we need to ensure that:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then we can choose a template character that matches `a[i]` and `b[i]` but does not match `c[i]`.

Here is a counterexample where the given program fails:

Input:
```
1
2
ab
ba
aa
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
```
Explanation:
- For the first position, `a[0] = 'a'` and `b[0] = 'b'`. We can choose 'A' as the template character, which matches `a[0]` and `b[0]` but does not match `c[0]`.
- For the second position, `a[1] = 'b'` and `b[1] = 'a'`. We can choose 'B' as the template character, which matches `a[1]` and `b[1]` but does not match `c[1]`.

The given program would return "NO" for this input because it does not find a single position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
