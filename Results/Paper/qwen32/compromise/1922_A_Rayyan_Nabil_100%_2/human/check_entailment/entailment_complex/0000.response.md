### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The template `t` can have letters that are either lowercase or uppercase. If the letter in the template is lowercase, the corresponding letter in the strings `a` and `b` must match it, and the corresponding letter in the string `c` must not match it. If the letter in the template is uppercase, the corresponding letter in the strings `a` and `b` must not match the lowercase version of the letter in the template, and the corresponding letter in the string `c` must match the lowercase version of the letter in the template.

The function `func_1` checks if there is at least one position `i` in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it means that we can construct a template `t` where the `i`-th letter is the uppercase version of `c[i]`, making `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template while `c[i]` does not. If no such position exists, it means that for every position `i`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same as `c[i]`, and it is impossible to construct such a template `t`.

The function `func_2` reads the input for multiple test cases, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described above, and `func_2` correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
Given the problem description and the provided code, the program is correct. It correctly checks the conditions and determines if there exists a template `t` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
