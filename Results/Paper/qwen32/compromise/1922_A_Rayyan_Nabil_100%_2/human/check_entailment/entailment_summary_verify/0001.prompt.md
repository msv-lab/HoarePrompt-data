You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 20`). It then computes and prints the number of positions at which the corresponding characters in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if there exists a template string `t` of length `n` such that:
- Both strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

The matching rules are:
- If the `i`-th character of `t` is lowercase, then the `i`-th character of `a` and `b` must be the same as the `i`-th character of `t`.
- If the `i`-th character of `t` is uppercase, then the `i`-th character of `a` and `b` must be different from the lowercase version of the `i`-th character of `t`.
- String `c` must not match the template `t` under the same rules.

### Program Analysis

Let's consider the provided program:

```python
# Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

#### Function `func_1`

This function checks if there is at least one position `i` where the characters in `a` and `b` are different from the character in `c`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', indicating that a suitable template exists. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

#### Function `func_2`

This function handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, and then uses `func_1` to determine if a suitable template exists. It collects the results and prints them.

### Correctness Analysis

The logic of `func_1` is flawed. The function checks if there is a position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that a suitable template exists that matches `a` and `b` while not matching `c`.

For a template `t` to exist:
1. For each position `i`, if `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be `a[i]` (lowercase).
2. If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be an uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
3. String `c` must not match the template `t`.

The current implementation does not consider all these conditions. It only checks if there is a position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which is not sufficient.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem based on the given requirements.

Correctness: **False**
