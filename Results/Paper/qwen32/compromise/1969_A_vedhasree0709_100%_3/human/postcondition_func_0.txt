The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an integer `p` in the list such that the value at index `p-1` is equal to `i+1` where `i` is the current index. If such an integer is found, it outputs `2` for that test case; otherwise, it outputs `3`. The function does not modify the input values `t`, `n`, or `l` after processing each test case.
