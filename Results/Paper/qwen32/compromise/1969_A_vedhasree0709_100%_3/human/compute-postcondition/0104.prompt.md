You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        i = 0
        
        j = 0
        
        while i <= n - 1:
            p = l[i]
            q = l[p - 1]
            if q == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        
        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: - `t`: Remains the same as the initial input.
    #- `n`: Remains the same as the input for the last test case.
    #- `l`: Remains the same as the list input for the last test case.
    #- `i`: Will be `n` if the inner loop completes all iterations without breaking for the last test case.
    #- `j`: Will be `0` if the condition `q == i + 1` was never met during the last test case, otherwise `1`.
    #
    #### Natural Language Description:
    #After all the test cases have been processed, the number of test cases `t`, the size of the list `n`, and the list `l` itself will remain unchanged from their initial and most recent respective inputs. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` if the inner loop completed all iterations without breaking for the last test case. The variable `j` will be `0` if the condition `q == i + 1` was never met during the last test case, otherwise it will be `1`.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, the function returns the number of integers in the list `p` that are not in their original positions (i.e., `p_i != i` for all i in [1, n]).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
