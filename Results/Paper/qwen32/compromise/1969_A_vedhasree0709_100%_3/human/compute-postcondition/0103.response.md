Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, the function returns the number of integers in the list `p` that are not in their original positions (i.e., `p_i != i` for all i in [1, n]).**
