Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is at least 3; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 2; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[l[2] - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, `j` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `j` or the flow continues.***
