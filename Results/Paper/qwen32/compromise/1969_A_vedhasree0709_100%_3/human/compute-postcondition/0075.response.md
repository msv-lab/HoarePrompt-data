Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`.**

In simple terms, the variable `q` is assigned the value of the element in list `l` at the index `p - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
