Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is 1 if `q` equals `i + 1`, otherwise `j` remains 0; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
