The code snippet provided initializes a variable `i` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the line `i = 0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0.**
