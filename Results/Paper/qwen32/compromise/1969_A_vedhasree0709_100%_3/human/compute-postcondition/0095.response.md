Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be at least 3; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 2; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[l[2] - 1]`; `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only affects the control flow by exiting the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
