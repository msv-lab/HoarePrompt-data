The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `l` by reading a new input, splitting it into parts, converting each part to an integer, and then storing these integers in the list `l`. The variables `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is `n`; `j` is 0 if `q` equals `i + 1` has not occurred at any iteration.**
