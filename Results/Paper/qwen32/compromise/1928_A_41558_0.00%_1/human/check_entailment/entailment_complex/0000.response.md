### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - If both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`), it prints 'NO'.
     - If `a` is double `b` (`a / 2 == b`) or `b` is double `a` (`b / 2 == a`), it prints 'NO'.
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'YES'.

Let's analyze these conditions:
- **Condition 1**: Both `a` and `b` being odd means the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. This is because cutting an odd-sized dimension results in non-integer sides.
- **Condition 2**: If one dimension is double the other, the resulting two smaller rectangles after the cut will be of the same size, and they can only form the same rectangle when rearranged (rotated or moved).
- **Otherwise**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it is possible to form a different rectangle by rearranging the two smaller rectangles.

### Verification with the Example:
Let's verify the example given in the problem statement:

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
   - Both `a` and `b` are odd. The program outputs 'NO', which is correct.
2. **Test Case 2**: `2 1`
   - `a` is not double `b`, but `b` is not double `a`, and `a` is not odd. However, since `b` is odd, the program outputs 'NO', which is correct.
3. **Test Case 3**: `2 6`
   - Neither `a` nor `b` are both odd, and `a` is not double `b`, but `b` is double `a`. The program outputs 'NO', which is incorrect (it should be 'YES').
4. **Test Case 4**: `3 2`
   - Neither `a` nor `b` are both odd, and `a` is not double `b`, and `b` is not double `a`. The program outputs 'YES', which is correct.
5. **Test Case 5**: `2 2`
   - Neither `a` nor `b` are both odd, and `a` is double `b`, and `b` is double `a`. The program outputs 'NO', which is correct.
6. **Test Case 6**: `2 4`
   - Neither `a` nor `b` are both odd, and `a` is not double `b`, but `b` is double `a`. The program outputs 'NO', which is incorrect (it should be 'YES').
7. **Test Case 7**: `6 3`
   - Neither `a` nor `b` are both odd, and `a` is not double `b`, and `b` is not double `a`. The program outputs 'NO', which is incorrect (it should be 'YES').

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles cases where one dimension is double the other. The correct approach should only check if both dimensions are odd. If both dimensions are odd, the answer is 'NO'. Otherwise, the answer is 'YES'.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
