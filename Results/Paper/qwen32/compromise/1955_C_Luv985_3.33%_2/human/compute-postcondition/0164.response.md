Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `l` is 0, `ans` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, and `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`.**
