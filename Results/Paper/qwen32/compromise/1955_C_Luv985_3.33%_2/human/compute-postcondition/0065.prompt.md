Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of integers; `l` is 0 or 1; `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to the original value of `k`, then `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`. If `a[r]` is 0 (where `r` is `n - 2`), `a[r]` remains 0, `a[0]` is 0 if it was 0, otherwise `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[n - 1]` is 0, `l` is 1, and `ans` is 2. If `a[r]` is not 0, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`, `l` is 0, and `ans` is 1. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `ans` is 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is a positive integer or a positive integer minus `mi * 2` if the if condition was met; `a` is a list of integers where `a[l]` and `a[r]` may have been decreased by `mi` if the if condition was met; `l` is 0 or 1 if `a[l]` was 0, otherwise `l` remains 0; `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before any potential decrease; `ans` is increased by 1 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was 0 or if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`. If the if condition was not met, `t` is 0 or 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is at least 1; `a` is a list of integers where `a[l]` and `a[r]` may have been decreased by `mi`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are decreased by `mi`, `l` is adjusted to be less than `r` + 1, `r` is adjusted to be greater than `l` + 1, and if `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before any potential decrease.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
