Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 1, and if `a[0]` was 0, `l` is set to 1, `a[l]` is set to `a[1]`, and `ans` is 1; otherwise, `l` remains 0. If `a[r]` is not 0, the state remains as described without changes to `r`, `l`, or `ans`. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
