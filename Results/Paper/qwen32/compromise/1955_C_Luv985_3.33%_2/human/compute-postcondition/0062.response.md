Postcondition: **`t` is either 0 or 1; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is at least 1; `a` is a list of integers where `a[l]` and `a[r]` may have been decreased by `mi` if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`; `l` is adjusted to be less than `r`; `r` is adjusted to be greater than `l`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before any potential decrease; `ans` is increased by 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are decreased by `mi` and `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `a[l]` and `a[r]` remain unchanged and `ans` is not increased.**
