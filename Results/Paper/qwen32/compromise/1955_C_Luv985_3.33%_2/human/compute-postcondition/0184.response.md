Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[l] == 0` or `a[r] == 0` in the if part, or if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0` in the else part. If `mi * 2 <= k`, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are decreased by `mi`. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is `k % 2` and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`.**
