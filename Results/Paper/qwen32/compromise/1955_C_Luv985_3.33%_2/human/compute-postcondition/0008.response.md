The code snippet provided converts each element of the list `a` from a substring (string) to an integer using the `map` function and a lambda function. The other variables `t`, `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers.**
