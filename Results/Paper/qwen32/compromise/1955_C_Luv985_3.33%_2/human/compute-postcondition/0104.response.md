The code snippet `a[r] -= mi` reduces the value of the element at index `r` in the list `a` by the value of `mi`.

Given the initial state, the value of `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 5 if `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `t` is `k % 2`. `T` is non-zero and has been decreased by 1. `n` is greater than 1. `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`. `a` is the list of integers from the input with the first element reduced by `2 * mi` and the last element further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`; otherwise, the first element is reduced by `mi`. The element at index `r` in `a` is reduced by `mi`. `r` is `n - 2` if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `r` is `n - 1`. `mi` is `min(a[0], a[r])`. `l` is 0. `ans` is 1 if `a[l]` is 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, or if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k`; otherwise, `ans` is 2 if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.**
