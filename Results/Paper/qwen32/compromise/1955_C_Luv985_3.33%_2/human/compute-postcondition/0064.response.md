Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is at least 1; `a` is a list of integers where `a[l]` and `a[r]` may have been decreased by `mi`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are decreased by `mi`, `l` is adjusted to be less than `r` + 1, `r` is adjusted to be greater than `l` + 1, and if `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before any potential decrease.**
