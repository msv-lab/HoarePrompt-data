Postcondition: **`t` is 5 if `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `t` is `k % 2`. `T` is non-zero and has been decreased by 1. `n` is greater than 1. `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`. `a` is the list of integers from the input with the first element reduced by `2 * mi` and the last element further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`; otherwise, the first element is reduced by `mi`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, the element at index `r` in `a` is reduced by `mi`. If `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, then `r` is `n - 3` and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is `n - 2`. `mi` is `min(a[0], a[r])`. If `a[l] == 0`, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1 from its initial value. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` retains its initial value. If `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is `ans + 1` if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts of the condition.
