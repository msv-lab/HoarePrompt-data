Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of integers; `l` is 0 or 1; `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to the original value of `k`, then `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`. If `a[r]` is 0 (where `r` is `n - 2`), `a[r]` remains 0, `a[0]` is 0 if it was 0, otherwise `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[n - 1]` is 0, `l` is 1, and `ans` is 2. If `a[r]` is not 0, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`, `l` is 0, and `ans` is 1. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `ans` is 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
