Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is 5
   - `T` is 0
   - `n` is 5
   - `k` is 4
   - `a` is `[0, 4, 5, 6, 4]`
   - `l` is 1
   - `r` is 4
   - `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `l` equals `r`. If `l` equals `r`, `ans` is updated to 2.

2. **Condition to Determine `ans`:**
   - The value of `ans` depends on the comparison between `l` and `r`.
   - Given `l` is 1 and `r` is 4, `l` does not equal `r`.

3. **Value of `ans`:**
   - Since `l` (1) does not equal `r` (4), `ans` remains 1.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet is `print(ans)`.
   - Based on the above analysis, `ans` is 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **1**
