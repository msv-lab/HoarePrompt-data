The code snippet `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` was `n - 1`. After executing the code, `r` becomes `n - 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the detailed output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is a positive integer decreased by `mi * 2`; `a[r]` is 0, where `r` is `n - 2`; if `a[l]` was 0, then `a[0]` is 0, otherwise `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`; `a[n - 1]` is 0; `l` is 1; `ans` is 2; `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`; `mi * 2` is less than or equal to the original value of `k`.**
