Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is 5 if the loop breaks due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `t` is `k % 2` from the last iteration; `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1; `a` is the list of integers from the input; `l` is 0; `ans` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`; `mi * 2` is greater than `k`**
