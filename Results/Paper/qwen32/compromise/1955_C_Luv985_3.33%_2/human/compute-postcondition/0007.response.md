The code snippet `a = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The variable `a` is assigned this list of substrings. The values of `t`, `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of substrings from the input.**
