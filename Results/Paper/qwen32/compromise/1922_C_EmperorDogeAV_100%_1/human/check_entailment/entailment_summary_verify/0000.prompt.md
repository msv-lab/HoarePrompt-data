You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = input().split()
    for i in range(n):
        cities[i] = int(cities[i])
    forward_cities = func_1(cities, n)

        else:

    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999

            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    return prog_cities



- Function Summary: 
The function takes a list of city coordinates and determines for each city (except the last one) whether the next city is the closest city. If the next city is the closest, it marks that position in the result list with `1`. Otherwise, it stores the distance to the next city in the result list. The function returns this list of `n - 1` elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the key points:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the cost to reach the closest city for each city. However, the logic to determine the closest city is flawed. Specifically, the logic `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back): prog_cities[i] = 1` is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the cost to reach the closest city. Instead, it should calculate the actual distance to the closest city.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle edge cases where the closest city might be at the boundaries (i.e., the first or last city in the list). The logic for determining the closest city should account for these cases properly.

3. **Incorrect Use of Prefix Sums**:
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated incorrectly. The prefix sums should accumulate the actual costs to reach the closest cities, not just the number of steps (which is what the current logic does).

4. **Incorrect Indexing**:
   - When calculating the prefix sums, the indexing is incorrect. The prefix sums should be calculated based on the actual distances to the closest cities, not just the number of steps.

5. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The program does not correctly handle queries where the starting city is greater than the ending city. The logic for reversing the prefix sums is incorrect and can lead to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the program to illustrate the necessary changes:

```python
def find_closest_cities(cities, n):
    closest_cities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            closest_cities[i] = abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])
        elif i == n - 1:
            closest_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1])
        else:
            left_dist = abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1])
            right_dist = abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])
            closest_cities[i] = min(left_dist, right_dist)
    return closest_cities

def calculate_prefix_sums(closest_cities, n):
    prefix_sum = [0] * n
    prefix_sum[0] = closest_cities[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + closest_cities[i]
    return prefix_sum

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    closest_cities = find_closest_cities(cities, n)
    pref_sum_f = calculate_prefix_sums(closest_cities, n)
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a > b:
            a, b = b, a
        cost = pref_sum_f[b - 2] - (pref_sum_f[a - 2] if a > 1 else 0)
        direct_cost = abs(cities[b - 1] - cities[a - 1])
        print(min(cost, direct_cost))
```

This corrected version properly calculates the closest cities, their costs, and handles the queries correctly.
