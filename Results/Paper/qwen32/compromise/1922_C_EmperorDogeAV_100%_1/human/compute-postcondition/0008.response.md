The code snippet provided updates the value of the variable `forward` to be the next city in the list `cities` based on the current index `i`. 

Given the initial state, if `i` is 0 or greater than 0 but less than `n - 1`, the value of `forward` was previously set to 999999999999999999. After the execution of the code snippet, `forward` will now hold the value of `cities[i + 1]`.

The other variables (`cities`, `prog_cities`, `i`, `back`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` (where `n` is at least 2) cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities, `m` as the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` as the queries; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros; `i` is 0 or greater than 0 and `i` is less than `n - 1`; if `i` is greater than 0, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`; if `i` is 0, `back` is -999999999999999999 and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`.**
