The provided code snippet only sets the value of the variable `back` to `-99999999999999999999`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `back` is updated, but all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities, `m` is the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` are the queries; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros except `prog_cities[i]` which is 1 if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` is `abs(forward - cities[i])`; `i` is 1 (assuming `i` was 0 in the previous iteration). If `i` is less than `n - 1`, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is 0, `back` is -999999999999999999 and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is `n - 1` or greater, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` remains 999999999999999999; `back` is -99999999999999999999.**
