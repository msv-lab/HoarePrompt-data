Postcondition: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` (where `n` is at least 2) cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities, `m` as the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` as the queries; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros; `i` is 0 or greater than 0; if `i` is greater than 0, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` remains 999999999999999999; if `i` is 0, `back` is -999999999999999999 and `forward` remains 999999999999999999.**
