### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program and its logic against the problem description.

1. **For `k >= 2`**:
   - If `n == k`, the program prints the array `[k, k, ..., k]` (k times). This works because all cyclic shifts of this array will be the same and thus sorted.
   - If `n != k`, the program outputs `-1`. This is correct because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts out of `n` where `k < n` and `k >= 2`. If `k` cyclic shifts are sorted, the remaining `n - k` cyclic shifts must not be sorted, but the uniformity of the array `[k, k, ..., k]` ensures all cyclic shifts are sorted, making it impossible to have exactly `k` sorted shifts when `k < n`.

2. **For `k < 2`** (i.e., `k == 1`):
   - The program prints the array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array is sorted, and any cyclic shift other than the original array will not be sorted. This satisfies the condition of having exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

### Test Cases Verification:
- **Test Case 1: `n = 2, k = 2`**
  - Output: `1 1`
  - Explanation: All cyclic shifts (both `[1, 1]`) are sorted.
- **Test Case 2: `n = 3, k = 1`**
  - Output: `69420 69 420`
  - Explanation: Only the first cyclic shift `[69420, 69, 420]` is sorted.
- **Test Case 3: `n = 3, k = 2`**
  - Output: `-1`
  - Explanation: It's impossible to have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts out of 3 with distinct elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem description and produces valid outputs for the given test cases.

### Correctness: **True**
