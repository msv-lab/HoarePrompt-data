The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints a sequence of numbers based on the conditions: if `k >= 2` and `n == k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times; if `k >= 2` and `n != k`, it prints `-1`; if `k < 2`, it prints numbers from `1` to `n`.
