The code snippet converts the binary string `s` into a list of integers. This means each character in the string `s` (which is either '0' or '1') is converted to its corresponding integer value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `s` is a binary string of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, consisting only of '0' and '1'
- `n` must be greater than 0

After executing the code `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))`, the string `s` is transformed into a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `s` is now a list of integers, each being either 0 or 1, representing the original binary string
- `n` remains greater than 0

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0**.
