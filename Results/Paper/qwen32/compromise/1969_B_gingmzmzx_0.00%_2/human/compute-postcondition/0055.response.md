The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` of the list `cnt` by 1. Given that `cnt` is initialized as `[0, 0]`, this means that if `c` is 0, the first element of `cnt` will be incremented, and if `c` is 1, the second element of `cnt` will be incremented.

Since `c` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `c` can only be 0 or 1 because the elements of the list `s` are either 0 or 1.

Therefore, the output state will depend on whether `c` is 0 or 1:

- If `c` is 0, `cnt` will become `[1, 0]`.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt` will become `[0, 1]`.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least one element, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `ans` is 0**.
