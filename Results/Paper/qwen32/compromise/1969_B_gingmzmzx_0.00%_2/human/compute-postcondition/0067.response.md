The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the current element `c` in the list `s` within the `cnt` list. Given that `c` is either 0 or 1, this operation increases either the first or the second element of the `cnt` list by 1.

Here's the updated state:
- If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least one element, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0 or `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
