Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least one element, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`. If `c` is 0, `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.**
