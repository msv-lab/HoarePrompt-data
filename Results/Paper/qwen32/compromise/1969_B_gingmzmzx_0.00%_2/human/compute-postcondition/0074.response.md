Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no direct parameters but processes `t` test cases where each test case consists of a binary string `s` of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, containing only '0' and '1'. For each test case, the function returns the result of some computation (not specified in the given details) based on the binary string `s`.**
