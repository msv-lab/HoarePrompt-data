The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a binary string `s`. For each binary string, it calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents the number of valid pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and the substring `s[i:j+1]` contains at least one '0' and one '1'.
