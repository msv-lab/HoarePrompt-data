Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then prints `2` if either `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`. Otherwise, it prints the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2`.**
