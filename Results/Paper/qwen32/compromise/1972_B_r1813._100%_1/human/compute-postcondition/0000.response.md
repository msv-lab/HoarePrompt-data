The code snippet provided only includes `input = sys.stdin.read`. This line reads the entire input from standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`. No further processing or changes to other variables or states are made by this single line of code.

Output State: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters directly, but it is expected to read input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down. `input` is assigned the entire input from standard input.**
