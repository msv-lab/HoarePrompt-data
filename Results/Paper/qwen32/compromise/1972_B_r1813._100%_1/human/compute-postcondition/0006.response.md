Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input from standard input consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters, where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down. The function processes each test case and returns the count of contiguous segments of "U" and "D" in the string `s` for each test case.**
