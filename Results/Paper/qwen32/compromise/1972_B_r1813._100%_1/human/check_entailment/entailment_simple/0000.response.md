### Reasoning:
The program reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it counts the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the string representing the coins. If the count of facing-up coins is odd, it prints "YES", indicating that Alice will win the game. Otherwise, it prints "NO", indicating that Bob will win.

The logic of the program is based on the observation that in the game, the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by playing optimally. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.

### Correctness:
The given program correctly implements the logic described above. It reads the input, counts the number of 'U' characters in each test case, and determines the winner based on the parity of this count. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
