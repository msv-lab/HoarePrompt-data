### Reasoning:

The given problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns flipping coins under certain rules. The key observation is that the game's outcome can be determined based on the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the initial configuration. Specifically, if the number of 'U's is odd, Alice will win if both players play optimally. If the number of 'U's is even, Bob will win.

The provided program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of coins `n` and a string `s` representing the coins' initial states. For each test case, it counts the number of 'U's in the string `s` and checks if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it prints 'YES' (indicating Alice wins), otherwise, it prints 'NO' (indicating Bob wins).

The execution summary confirms that the program correctly reads the input, counts the 'U's, and makes the appropriate decision based on whether the count is odd or even. This matches the problem's requirement for determining the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Correctness:

Given that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of 'U's, and this logic aligns with the problem's requirements, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
