### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the logic of the provided code and compare it against the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Square**: 
   - Consists of `k` consecutive rows, where each row has `k` consecutive `1`s.
   - All `1`s must be aligned in such a way that they form a perfect square.
   
2. **Triangle**:
   - Consists of `k` consecutive rows, where the `i-th` row has `2*i - 1` consecutive `1`s.
   - The `1`s must be centered around a central column, forming either an upright or upside-down triangle.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0
        
        b = ''
        
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
```

- **Loop through Test Cases**: The outer loop iterates over the number of test cases `t`.
- **Reading Input**: For each test case, the grid size `n` is read, followed by `n` lines of the grid.
- **Counting `1`s**:
  - If a row contains exactly one `1`, the variable `a` is set to `'TRIANGLE'`.
  - If a row contains more than one `1`, the variable `b` is set to `'SQUARE'`.
- **Decision Making**:
  - If `a` is not `0` (meaning a row had exactly one `1`), the program prints `'TRIANGLE'`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `'SQUARE'`.

#### Issues in the Code:
- **Incorrect Detection Logic**:
  - The code does not check the alignment or pattern of `1`s across multiple rows. It only checks the count of `1`s in individual rows.
  - For example, a grid like:
    ```
    001
    010
    100
    ```
    would incorrectly be classified as a square because each row has exactly one `1`. However, this is not a valid triangle or square according to the problem statement.
- **No Handling of Upside Down Triangles**:
  - The code does not account for upside-down triangles, which require checking the pattern starting from the bottom row upwards.
- **No Validation of Square Shape**:
  - The code does not ensure that the `1`s form a perfect square by checking if all rows with `1`s have the same number of `1`s and if they are aligned correctly.

#### Conclusion:
Given the above issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to distinguish between a triangle and a square based on the problem description.

### Correctness: **False**
