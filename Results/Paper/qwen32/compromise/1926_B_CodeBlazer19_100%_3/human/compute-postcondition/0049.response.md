Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by user input. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', or `a` remains unchanged if `s` does not contain any '1's, and `b` remains an empty string. `j` is 1.**
