Let's break down the given initial state and determine the value of the variable `a` that will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **t**: This is the initial input integer, but its specific value is not crucial for determining the value of `a`.
2. **i**: This is set to 2, but it does not affect the value of `a`.
3. **n**: This is the initial input integer, similar to `t`, its specific value does not affect `a`.
4. **a**: This is explicitly set to the string `'TRIANGLE'`.
5. **b**: This is set to the string `'SQUARE'` if any string `s` had more than one '1'. However, since no such string `s` is mentioned in the initial state, we assume `b` remains an empty string `''`.
6. **j**: This is the initial input integer, and its specific value does not affect `a`.
7. **Additional Note**: The current value of `a` is not 0, but since `a` is explicitly set to `'TRIANGLE'`, this note doesn't change the value of `a`.

### Determining the Output:

Given that `a` is explicitly set to `'TRIANGLE'` in the initial state, the `print(a)` statement will simply print the value of `a`.

### Final Answer:

Output: **TRIANGLE**
