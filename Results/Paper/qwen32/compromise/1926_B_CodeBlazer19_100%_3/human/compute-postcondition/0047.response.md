The code snippet assigns the string `'TRIANGLE'` to the variable `a`. This means that regardless of the previous value of `a`, it is now set to `'TRIANGLE'`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by user input, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is '' if `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1', or `b` remains an empty string if `s` does not contain any '1's, `j` is 1.**
