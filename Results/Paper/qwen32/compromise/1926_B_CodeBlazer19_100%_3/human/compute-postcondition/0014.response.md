The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is some value (let's denote it as `j_old`) and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain the same (since it determines the total number of iterations).

So, if `j_old` was the value of `j` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j_old + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j_old` from the given information, we can denote the new value of `j` as `j_old + 1`. However, to keep the answer general and aligned with the provided format, we can simply say that `j` is incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by user input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` does not contain any '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string, `j` is incremented by 1**.

Given the format requirement, we'll specify the state of `j` more clearly:

State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by user input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` does not contain any '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string, `j` is 1** (assuming `j` started at 0 in the first iteration).

If we need to generalize this for any `j_old`, we would say `j` is `j_old + 1`, but since we don't have `j_old` explicitly, we'll assume the simplest case where `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by user input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` does not contain any '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string, `j` is 1**.

However, to generalize:

State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by user input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` does not contain any '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string, `j` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity and simplicity in the context of the problem:

State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by user input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` does not contain any '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string, `j` is 1**.
