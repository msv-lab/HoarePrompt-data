To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the last string `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise it retains its previous value.
- `b` is 'SQUARE' if any string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise it is ''.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- The condition for `a` and `b` does not affect the loop head directly.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `t-1`, at the start of each iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the iterations as it defines the range of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the last string `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise it retains its previous value, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise it is '', and `j` is `n-1`**.
