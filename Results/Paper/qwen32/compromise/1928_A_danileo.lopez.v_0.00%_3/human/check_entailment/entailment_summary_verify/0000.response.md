Let's analyze the problem, the program code, and the function summary to verify the correctness of the provided program.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90Â° rotation are the same.

### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Function Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if at least one of the dimensions of the rectangle is even and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise 'No'. 

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program is correct. The reasoning is based on the observation that if either dimension of the rectangle is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.

### Analysis:
Let's verify the logic with the given examples and the problem constraints.

1. **1 \(\times\) 1 rectangle**: Both dimensions are odd. The program outputs "No". This is correct because a 1 \(\times\) 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles.
2. **2 \(\times\) 1 rectangle**: One dimension is even. The program outputs "Yes". This is correct because a 2 \(\times\) 1 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \(\times\) 1 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1 \(\times\) 2 rectangle.
3. **2 \(\times\) 6 rectangle**: One dimension is even. The program outputs "Yes". This is correct because a 2 \(\times\) 6 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \(\times\) 6 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 2 \(\times\) 3 rectangle.
4. **3 \(\times\) 2 rectangle**: One dimension is even. The program outputs "Yes". This is correct because a 3 \(\times\) 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \(\times\) 1 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1 \(\times\) 6 rectangle.
5. **2 \(\times\) 2 rectangle**: One dimension is even. The program outputs "Yes". This is correct because a 2 \(\times\) 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \(\times\) 2 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1 \(\times\) 4 rectangle.
6. **2 \(\times\) 4 rectangle**: One dimension is even. The program outputs "Yes". This is correct because a 2 \(\times\) 4 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \(\times\) 4 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 2 \(\times\) 2 rectangle.
7. **6 \(\times\) 3 rectangle**: One dimension is even. The program outputs "Yes". This is incorrect because a 6 \(\times\) 3 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \(\times\) 3 rectangles, which can only form a 3 \(\times\) 6 rectangle, which is the same as the original rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect. The program outputs "Yes" for the case of a 6 \(\times\) 3 rectangle, which is incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
