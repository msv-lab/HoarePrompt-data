Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. The logic is based on the observation that if either dimension of the rectangle is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. This is because an even dimension allows for a cut that results in two smaller rectangles of integer dimensions, which can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. **1 \(\times\) 1 rectangle**: Both dimensions are odd, so the output is "No". This is correct because a 1 \(\times\) 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles.

2. **2 \(\times\) 1 rectangle**: One dimension is even, so the output is "Yes". This is correct because a 2 \(\times\) 1 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \(\times\) 1 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1 \(\times\) 2 rectangle.

3. **2 \(\times\) 6 rectangle**: One dimension is even, so the output is "Yes". This is correct because a 2 \(\times\) 6 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \(\times\) 6 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 2 \(\times\) 3 rectangle.

4. **3 \(\times\) 2 rectangle**: One dimension is even, so the output is "Yes". This is correct because a 3 \(\times\) 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \(\times\) 1 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1 \(\times\) 6 rectangle.

5. **2 \(\times\) 2 rectangle**: One dimension is even, so the output is "Yes". This is correct because a 2 \(\times\) 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \(\times\) 2 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1 \(\times\) 4 rectangle.

6. **2 \(\times\) 4 rectangle**: One dimension is even, so the output is "Yes". This is correct because a 2 \(\times\) 4 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \(\times\) 4 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 2 \(\times\) 2 rectangle.

7. **6 \(\times\) 3 rectangle**: One dimension is even, so the output is "No". This is correct because a 6 \(\times\) 3 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \(\times\) 3 rectangles, which can only form a 3 \(\times\) 6 rectangle, which is the same as the original rectangle.

In all cases, the program produces the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
