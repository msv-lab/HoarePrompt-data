Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an input integer, the input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of an n x n binary grid. Following n is n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. Each grid contains exactly one shape, which is either a triangle or a square, and the shape consists of more than one '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is greater than 0, `b` is the last string input by the user, and `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from all input strings `b` that contained '1'. If the first and second elements of `k` are equal, then the first and second counts of '1's in the respective input strings are the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop runs for a total number of times specified by the initial integer input. After all iterations, `b` will be the last string input by the user. `k` will contain the counts of '1's from each string `b` that contained '1' during the loop iterations. If the count of '1's in the first element of `k` is equal to the count of '1's in the second element of `k`, then the program will execute the if part. Otherwise, there is no else part to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `a` remains the same, `b` is the string input by the user in the last iteration, and `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each input string that contained '1'. Additionally, `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
