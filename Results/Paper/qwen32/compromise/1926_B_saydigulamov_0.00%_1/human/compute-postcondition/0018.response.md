To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variable `a`**: It is mentioned that `a` is greater than 0. However, the value of `a` is not used in the provided print statement, so its exact value is irrelevant for this task.

2. **Variable `b`**: This variable holds the last string input by the user. Since the specific string is not provided, we can't know the exact value of `b`. However, it is mentioned that `b` contains '1' because the counts of '1's from input strings containing '1' are stored in the list `k`.

3. **List `k`**: This list contains counts of '1's from all input strings `b` that contained '1'. It is explicitly stated that the first and second elements of `k` are equal. This means `k[0] == k[1]`.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the list `k`.

### Determining the Output:
Since the exact values of the input strings and thus the exact counts of '1's are not provided, we can only describe the structure of the list `k` based on the given information. The only specific detail we have is that the first and second elements of `k` are equal.

### Conclusion:
The list `k` must have at least two elements, and the first and second elements are the same. The exact values of these elements are not known, but they are equal. Any additional elements in `k` (if there are any) are not constrained by the given information.

Thus, based on the information provided, the output will be a list where the first and second elements are equal.

Output: **[x, x, ...] (where x is the count of '1's in the first and second input strings containing '1', and any additional elements are not constrained by the given information)**
