You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of an n x n binary grid. Following n is n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. Each grid contains exactly one shape, which is either a triangle or a square, and the shape consists of more than one '1'.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: i
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an n x n binary grid containing exactly one shape made up of '1's. The shape is either a triangle or a square. The function checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows of the grid are equal and prints the counts if they are.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incomplete Logic**: The program only counts the number of '1's in rows that contain at least one '1'. It then checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal. This logic is insufficient to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

2. **Output Mismatch**: The program prints the list `k` instead of printing "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem description.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle various edge cases such as:
    - Triangles that are upside down.
    - Triangles where the central column of '1's is not in the middle.
    - Squares that are not aligned with the left edge of the grid.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3
001
011
111
```
**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Actual Output:**
```
[1, 2, 3]
```

The program fails to recognize that the given grid forms a triangle and instead prints the counts of '1's in each row.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
