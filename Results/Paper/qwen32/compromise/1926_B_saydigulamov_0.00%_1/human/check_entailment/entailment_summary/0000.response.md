Reasoning:  
The given program is not correctly solving the problem as described. The program is designed to check if the number of '1's in the first two rows of the grid are equal and prints the counts if they are. However, this approach does not correctly determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
1. Identify the shape formed by the '1's in the grid.
2. Check if the shape is a triangle or a square based on the specific criteria given in the problem statement.
3. Print "SQUARE" if the shape is a square and "TRIANGLE" otherwise.

The provided program does not perform these checks and instead just prints the count of '1's in the first two rows if they are equal, which is not a valid solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
