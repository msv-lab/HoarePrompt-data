Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` is greater than the new value of `i`; `num` is increased by 2.**

In simple terms, the values of `c` and `r` remain the same as they were obtained from the input. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and `k` still holds a value greater than this new `i`. The value of `num` has been increased by 2.
