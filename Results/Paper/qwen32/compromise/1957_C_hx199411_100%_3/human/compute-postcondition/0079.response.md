The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4 and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `m` must still be at least 3 (which it already is).

State: **`t` is falsy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25, `i` is 5**
