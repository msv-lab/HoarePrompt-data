The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `k`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` is greater than the new value of `i`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1), and `k` is greater than the new value of `i`. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is adjusted based on whether `c` equals `r` plus 1. Otherwise, `num` is adjusted based on whether `c` equals `r` and then increased by 2.**

Since the only variable we can modify is `i` (and `k` remains the same as it is already greater than the new value of `i`), we just need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is now the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and `k` is greater than the new value of `i`. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is adjusted based on whether `c` equals `r` plus 1. Otherwise, `num` is adjusted based on whether `c` equals `r` and then increased by 2.**

To make it clear:
State: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` is greater than the new value of `i`.**
