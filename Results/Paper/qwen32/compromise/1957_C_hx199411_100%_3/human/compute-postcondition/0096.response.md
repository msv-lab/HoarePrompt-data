The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k` if `m` equals 1, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`. However, since we are at the start of the next iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1 in the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Given that the loop condition is `for i in range(k)`, `i` must be less than `k` for the loop to continue. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is truthy - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was `k` if `m` equals 1, otherwise `m + 1` at the end of the previous iteration), `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.**
