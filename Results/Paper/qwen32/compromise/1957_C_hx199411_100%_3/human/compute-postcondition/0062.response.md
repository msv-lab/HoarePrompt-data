The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial state, `num` is either 2 or 4. If `num` was 2, it becomes 4. If `num` was 4, it becomes 6. Therefore, the updated value of `num` is either 4 or 6.

Output State: **`t` is truthy and decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` remains 0 if it was 0, remains 1 if it was 1, and is set to 8 if it was greater than 1, `dp` is set to `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937]`, `i` is set to 2, `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `num` is either 4 or 6.**
