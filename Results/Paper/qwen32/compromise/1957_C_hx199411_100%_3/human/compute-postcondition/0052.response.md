The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial state, `num` is initially 0, so after the operation, `num` becomes 2. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is truthy and decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 2, if `m` is 0, `m` remains 0, if `m` is 1, `m` remains 1, if `m` is greater than 1, `m` is set to 8, `dp` is set to `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937]`, and `i` is set to 9; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, and `c` is not equal to `r`**.
