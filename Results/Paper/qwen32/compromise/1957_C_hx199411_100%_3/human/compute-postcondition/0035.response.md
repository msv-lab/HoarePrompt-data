The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `3, m + 1`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `m` must be at least 4.

Given that `m` is at least 3, for the loop to execute again, it must be at least 4. Therefore, we adjust `i` to 4.

State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` over the `k` iterations, `m` is at least 4, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is 7, `i` is 4**
