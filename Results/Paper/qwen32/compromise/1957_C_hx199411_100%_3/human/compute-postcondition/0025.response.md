The `print(1)` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m`, but these are not used in the print statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`), but none of these are used in the `print(1)` statement.
2. The `print(1)` statement directly prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
