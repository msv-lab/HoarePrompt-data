To determine the final state of the loop, we need to continue applying the loop's logic until `i` reaches `m + 1`. We know the state after the first three iterations, so we'll compute the subsequent values of `dp[i]` until the loop completes.

Given:
- `dp[1]` is `1`
- `dp[2]` is `3`
- `dp[3]` is `7`
- `dp[4]` is `25`
- `dp[5]` is `81`

We need to compute `dp[6]` and so on until `i` reaches `m + 1`.

The formula used in the loop is:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

Let's compute the next values:

For `i = 6`:
\[ dp[6] = (dp[5] + 5 * dp[4] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[6] = (81 + 5 * 25 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[6] = (81 + 250) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[6] = 331 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[6] = 331 \]

For `i = 7`:
\[ dp[7] = (dp[6] + 6 * dp[5] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[7] = (331 + 6 * 81 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[7] = (331 + 972) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[7] = 1303 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[7] = 1303 \]

For `i = 8`:
\[ dp[8] = (dp[7] + 7 * dp[6] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[8] = (1303 + 7 * 331 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[8] = (1303 + 4634) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[8] = 5937 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[8] = 5937 \]

We continue this process until `i` reaches `m + 1`. However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `m`, we can assume that the loop runs until the end of the range specified by the initial conditions.

Given the pattern, we can infer that the loop will continue to compute values for `dp[i]` until `i` reaches `m + 1`. Since the problem does not provide the exact value of `m`, we will assume that the loop runs until the point where `i` reaches the maximum value in the range, which is `m + 1`.

Let's assume `m` is such that the loop runs until `i = 8` for simplicity, as the problem provides the state after 3 iterations and the pattern is clear.

Thus, the final state of `dp` after all iterations is:
\[ dp = [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] \]

However, since the exact value of `m` is not provided, we will generalize the final state based on the pattern observed.

The final output state after all iterations of the loop is:
Output State: **`t` is truthy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` values computed using the loop formula, and `i` is `m + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the loop continues to compute the values of `dp` until `i` reaches `m + 1`, and the final state of `dp` is a list of values computed using the given formula.
