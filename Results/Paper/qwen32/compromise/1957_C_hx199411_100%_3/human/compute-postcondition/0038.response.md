Let's calculate the new value of `dp[i]` based on the given formula and the initial state.

Given:
- `i` is 5
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 7
- `dp[4]` is 25

The formula for `dp[i]` is:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = (25 + 4 * 7 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = (25 + 56) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = 81 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = 81 \]

So, `dp[5]` is updated to 81.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` over the `k` iterations, `m` is at least 4, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81, `i` is 5.**
