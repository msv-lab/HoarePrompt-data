You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

    #State: `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are the values from the last test case, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s for the last test case, `m` is `n - num` for the last test case, `dp` is the DP array computed for `m` if `m > 1`, and `i` is `m + 1` if `m > 1` or `k` if `m == 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the size of a grid and an integer `k` representing the number of moves made on the grid. It also receives `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the row and column of each move. The function calculates and prints a result based on the moves made, which is either `1` if the remaining cells after accounting for the moves are `0` or `1`, or a computed value using dynamic programming if there are more than one remaining cells.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after the initial k moves, taking into account the rules and constraints of the game.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It initializes a counter `num` to keep track of the number of positions affected by the initial k moves.

2. **Processing the k Moves**:
   - For each of the k moves, the program reads the coordinates `(c, r)`.
   - If `c == r`, it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn in this case).
   - If `c != r`, it increments `num` by 2 (since both the player and the computer place rooks).

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**:
   - The program calculates `m = n - num`, which represents the number of positions left on the board that can still be used for placing rooks.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If `m == 0` or `m == 1`, the program outputs `1` because there's only one possible configuration (either no rooks or a single rook).

5. **Dynamic Programming (DP) for Larger m**:
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in `i` positions.
   - The base cases are set as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to fill the DP array.

6. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the value of `dp[m]` for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Base Case Handling**: The base cases for `m == 0` and `m == 1` are correctly handled.
- **DP Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation used in the DP array correctly accounts for the different ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.
- **Modulo Operation**: The results are correctly taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement, including handling the constraints and computing the number of configurations using dynamic programming.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
