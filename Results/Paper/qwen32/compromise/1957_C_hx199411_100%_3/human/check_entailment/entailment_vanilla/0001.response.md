To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after the initial k moves, taking into account the rules and constraints of the game.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It initializes a counter `num` to keep track of the number of positions affected by the initial k moves.

2. **Processing the k Moves**:
   - For each of the k moves, the program reads the coordinates `(c, r)`.
   - If `c == r`, it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn in this case).
   - If `c != r`, it increments `num` by 2 (since both the player and the computer place rooks).

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**:
   - The program calculates `m = n - num`, which represents the number of positions left on the board that can still be used for placing rooks.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If `m == 0` or `m == 1`, the program outputs `1` because there's only one possible configuration (either no rooks or a single rook).

5. **Dynamic Programming (DP) for Larger m**:
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in `i` positions.
   - The base cases are set as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to fill the DP array.

6. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the value of `dp[m]` for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Base Case Handling**: The base cases for `m == 0` and `m == 1` are correctly handled.
- **DP Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation used in the DP array correctly accounts for the different ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.
- **Modulo Operation**: The results are correctly taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement, including handling the constraints and computing the number of configurations using dynamic programming.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
