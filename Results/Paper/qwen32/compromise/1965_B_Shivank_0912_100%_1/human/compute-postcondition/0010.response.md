To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses. The loop increments `i` as long as `1 << (i + 1)` (which is equivalent to \(2^{(i+1)}\)) is less than or equal to `k`. 

Let's break down the loop iterations:

- After the first iteration (`i = 0`), the condition becomes `1 << (0 + 1) <= k` which simplifies to `2 <= k`. If true, `i` is incremented to 1.
- After the second iteration (`i = 1`), the condition becomes `1 << (1 + 1) <= k` which simplifies to `4 <= k`. If true, `i` is incremented to 2.
- After the third iteration (`i = 2`), the condition becomes `1 << (2 + 1) <= k` which simplifies to `8 <= k`. If true, `i` is incremented to 3.

The loop will continue until `1 << (i + 1)` exceeds `k`. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be the largest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} \leq k\).

The final state of the loop can be described as follows:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is only used in the condition of the loop.
- `i` will be the largest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} \leq k\).

To find the exact final value of `i`, we need to determine the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. This can be calculated as the floor of the base-2 logarithm of `k`.

Let's denote this final value of `i` as `floor(log2(k))`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `i` is floor(log2(k)).**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `i` will be the largest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)}\) is still less than or equal to `k`. All other variables (`t` and `n`) remain unchanged.
