The given code appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Since `j` is 2, `1 << j` evaluates to `1 << 2`, which is 4. Therefore, the value 4 is appended to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `i` is `i_final`, `tc` is 3, `j` is 2, and `ans` contains the values [2, 4].**
