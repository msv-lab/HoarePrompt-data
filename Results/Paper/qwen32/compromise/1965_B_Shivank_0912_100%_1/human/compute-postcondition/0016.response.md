The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an integer read from input.
- `k` is an integer read from input.
- `i` is floor(log2(k)).
- `ans` is a list containing either three elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` or four elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]` depending on whether `j` is not equal to `i`.
- `j` is 0.

Since `j` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `i` is floor(log2(k)); `ans` is a list containing either three elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` or four elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]` depending on whether `j` is not equal to `i`; `j` is 1**.
