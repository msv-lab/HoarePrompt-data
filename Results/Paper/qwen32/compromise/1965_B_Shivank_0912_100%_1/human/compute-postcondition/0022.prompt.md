Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `i` is floor(log2(k)); `ans` is a list containing three elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(20):
    if j != i:
        ans.append(1 << j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `i` is floor(log2(k)); `ans` is a list containing either three elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` or four elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]` depending on whether `j` is not equal to `i`; `j` is 0. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` includes an additional element `1` at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `i` is floor(log2(k)); `j` is 1. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is a list containing five elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains a list containing either three elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` or four elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]` depending on the initial state of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `i` is \(\lfloor \log_2(k) \rfloor\); `j` is 2. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is a list containing either four elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 4]`, five elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 4]`, or six elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4]` depending on the initial state of `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains a list containing either three elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` or four elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]` depending on the initial state of `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
