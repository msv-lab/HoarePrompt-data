To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `1 << i + 1 <= k`.

Given the state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `i` is 0
- The list and `ans` exclude `2^i`

Let's analyze the condition `1 << i + 1 <= k`:

- `1 << i` is a bitwise left shift operation, which is equivalent to \(2^i\).
- Since `i` is 0 initially, `1 << i` equals \(2^0 = 1\).
- Therefore, `1 << i + 1` translates to `1 + 1 = 2` (assuming the expression is evaluated as `(1 << i) + 1`).

For the loop to execute, the condition `2 <= k` must be true.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`. It must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 3, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding `2^i`**
