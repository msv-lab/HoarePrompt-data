Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 3, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding `2^i`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
