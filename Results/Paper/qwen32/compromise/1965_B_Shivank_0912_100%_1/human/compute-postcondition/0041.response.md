The code snippet appends the value `1 << j` to the list `ans`. This means that the list `ans` will now include the new element `2^j`.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `k`, the list (excluding `2^i`), `tc`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged except for the list `ans` which gains a new element.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 2, `i` is the largest integer such that `2^(i + 1) > k`, `j` is `j + 1`, `ans` includes `1 << j`**.
