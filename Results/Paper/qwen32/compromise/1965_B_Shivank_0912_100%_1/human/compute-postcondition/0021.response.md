Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `i` is \(\lfloor \log_2(k) \rfloor\); `j` is 2. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is a list containing either four elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 4]`, five elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 4]`, or six elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4]` depending on the initial state of `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains a list containing either three elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` or four elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]` depending on the initial state of `ans`.**
