The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `c`, which is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 18 inclusive, and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10^7 inclusive. The function prints either "13 0" or two lines "4 1" followed by "1 2", depending on the value of `c`. However, due to the incorrect condition checking, it will always print "13 0" for any valid input list. The function returns `None`.
