### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements and the examples given.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1(len(a))` which is `func_1(c)` where `c` is the length of the array.

2. **Function `func_1(c)`:**
   - The function checks if the length of the array `c` is equal to 2.
   - If `c` is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `13 0`.

3. **Problems with the Program:**
   - The program does not actually compute the MEX or perform the operations described in the problem.
   - It only checks if the length of the array is 2 and then prints a hardcoded result.
   - For arrays of length other than 2, it prints `13 0` regardless of the actual array values, which is incorrect for most cases.

4. **Examples Analysis:**
   - For the first example (`2\n0 1`), the program correctly outputs `4 1\n1 2`.
   - However, for the second example (`3\n1 3 9`), the program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect since the actual maximum sum is `13` but no operations are needed, and the input-output pair shows that no operations are needed, which means the program should output `13 0` but without the logic of how it got there.
   - For the third example (`4\n1 100 2 1`), the correct output is `105 2\n3 3\n3 4`, but the program outputs `13 0`.
   - For the fourth example (`1\n0`), the program should output `1 1\n1 1` but it outputs `13 0`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the MEX and perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array. It only handles a specific case (when the array length is 2) correctly and outputs hardcoded results for other cases, which are incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
