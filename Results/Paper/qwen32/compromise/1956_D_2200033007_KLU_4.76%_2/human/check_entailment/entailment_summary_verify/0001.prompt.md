You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if c == 2:
        print(f'4 1')
        print(f'1 2')
    else:
        print(f'13 0')
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `c`, which is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 18 inclusive, and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10^7 inclusive. The function prints either "13 0" or two lines "4 1" followed by "1 2", depending on the value of `c`. However, due to the incorrect condition checking, it will always print "13 0" for any valid input list. The function returns `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It has several issues:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input array `a` as strings, not integers. This will cause issues when performing arithmetic operations or comparisons on the array elements.
2. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` only handles the cases where the length of the array is 2 or not 2. It does not implement the logic to compute the MEX and perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array.
3. **Output**: The program always outputs the same results for arrays of length 2 and arrays of any other length, which is incorrect and does not follow the problem's requirements.
4. **General Logic**: The program lacks the logic to find the MEX of any subarray and to perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
