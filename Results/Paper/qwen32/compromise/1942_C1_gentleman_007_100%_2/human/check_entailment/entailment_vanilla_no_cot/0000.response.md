Correctness: **False**

The provided program includes a large number of utility functions that are not directly relevant to solving the problem at hand. The core of the problem is to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed in a regular polygon using a given set of vertices and no additional vertices (since y=0).

The given program does not contain any logic to solve this specific problem. It reads input and defines multiple functions, but none of them are used to compute the required output. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
