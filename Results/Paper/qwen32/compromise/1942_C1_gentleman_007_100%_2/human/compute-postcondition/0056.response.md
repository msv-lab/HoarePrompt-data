Functionality: **The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, and a graph represented as a dictionary (or list of lists) where each key (or index) is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices. It also accepts a list `vis` where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise. The function returns a value based on the visitation status and adjacency of the vertex `ver`.**

- **Case_1:** If `ver` has already been visited (`vis[ver]` is 1), the function returns a value indicating that the vertex has been visited.
- **Case_2:** If `ver` has not been visited (`vis[ver]` is 0), the function processes the adjacency list of `ver` and returns a value indicating the result of this processing, which could involve marking the vertex as visited and exploring its adjacent vertices.
