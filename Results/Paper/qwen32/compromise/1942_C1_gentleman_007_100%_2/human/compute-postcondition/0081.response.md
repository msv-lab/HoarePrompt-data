Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` contains the LCS of `a` and `b` in reverse order, `s` is the LCS of `a` and `b` in the correct order.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of the string formed by joining the elements of the list `l` in the order they appear, effectively reversing the order of the LCS stored in `l`. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
