The code appends `node` to the deque `q`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `q` now contains the previously removed first element `ver`, followed by the rest of the elements that were in `q` before, and now includes `node` at the end. The variable `vis[node]` is still 0 since the code does not change its value. The other conditions and states provided in the initial state remain valid.

Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has the first element `ver` followed by the previous elements of `q` and now includes `node` at the end, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `vis[node]` is 0, `graph[ver]` must have at least one node, and `vis[node]` is 0 for the current `node` being considered.**
