Let's break down the given information and determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`ver`**: This variable holds the value of the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`. This vertex has been removed from the deque.
2. **`q`**: This is a deque (double-ended queue) that had its first element (which is now stored in `ver`) removed.
3. **`vis`**: This is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise.
4. **`vis[node]`**: For each `node` in `q`, `vis[node]` is 1, indicating that all vertices currently in the deque have been visited.

### Code Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(ver, end=' ')
```
- `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q` before it was removed.
- `end=' '` specifies that the print statement should end with a space instead of a newline.

### Determining the Output:
- The value of `ver` is a specific vertex that was at the front of the deque `q` before it was removed.
- Since `ver` is a vertex, it is likely an integer representing the index or identifier of the vertex in the graph or a similar data structure.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the value of `ver` followed by a space. Since the exact value of `ver` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it as the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q` before it was removed.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **ver (where ver is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q` before it was removed)**
