Output State: **`ver` is the last vertex that was processed, `q` is empty, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` and 0 for all other vertices.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `ver` holds the value of the last vertex that was processed during the breadth-first search (BFS).
- `q` is empty because all reachable vertices have been processed and removed from the queue.
- `vis` is a list where each element is 1 if the corresponding vertex is reachable from the starting vertex and 0 otherwise.
