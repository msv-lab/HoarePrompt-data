Postcondition: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `node` is the next adjacent vertex in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed. If `vis[node]` was originally 0, then `vis[node]` is now 1 and `node` is appended to the deque `q`. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains unchanged and `q` is not modified.**
