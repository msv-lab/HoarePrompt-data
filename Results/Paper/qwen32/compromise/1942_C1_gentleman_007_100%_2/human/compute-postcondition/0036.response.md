To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the code. The loop iterates over each node connected to the current vertex `ver` in the graph. If a node has not been visited (`vis[node] == 0`), it is appended to the deque `q` and marked as visited (`vis[node] = 1`).

Given that the loop executes 3 times, we know that there are at least 3 unvisited nodes connected to `ver` in the graph. After these iterations, all unvisited nodes connected to `ver` will have been processed. Therefore, in the final state, all nodes connected to `ver` will have been visited, and `q` will include all those nodes that were not already in `q` and were not visited before.

Here's the final output state:

**Output State: `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has the first element `ver` followed by the previous elements of `q` and now includes all unvisited nodes from `graph[ver]` at the end, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, and `vis[node]` is 1 for each `node` in `graph[ver]`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `ver` remains the vertex at the front of the deque `q`, and `q` includes all nodes connected to `ver` that were not visited before. The `vis` list reflects that all nodes connected to `ver` have been visited.
