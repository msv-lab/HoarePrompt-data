Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `dp` matrix is fully populated with the lengths of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between all prefixes of `a` and `b`. The value at `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the LCS between the entire lists `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a)`, and `j` is `len(b)`. `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while i != 0 and j != 0:
    if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
        i -= 1
    else:
        i -= 1
        j -= 1
        l.append(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The `dp` matrix is fully populated with the lengths of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between all prefixes of `a` and `b`. The value at `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the LCS between the entire lists `a` and `b`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is 0. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `j` is either 0 or 1. The list `l` either contains the element `a[0]` if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, or it remains an empty list if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The `dp` matrix is fully populated with the lengths of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between all prefixes of `a` and `b`. The value at `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the LCS between the entire lists `a` and `b`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is 0. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1 if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, otherwise `j` is 0. The list `l` contains the element `a[0]` if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` and `j` are both greater than 0. If `dp[i][j]` was equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `j` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is decreased by 1, and if `dp[i][j]` was equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, `j` remains unchanged; otherwise, `j` is decreased by 1 and `l` has an additional element `a[i]` appended to it.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
