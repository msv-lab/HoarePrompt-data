The code appends `node` to the deque `q`. This action modifies `q` by adding `node` to its end. The values of `ver`, `graph`, `vis`, and `node` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque with `node` appended to it, `node` is the next adjacent vertex in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed.**
