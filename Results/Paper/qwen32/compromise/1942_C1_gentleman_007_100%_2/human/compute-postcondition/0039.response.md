The code snippet `ver = q.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the queue `q` and assigns it to the variable `ver`. This means that `ver` will now hold the value of the vertex that was at the front of the queue `q`. After this operation, the queue `q` will have one less element.

The state of `vis` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it. The precondition that `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices reachable from the initial `ver` and 0 for all other vertices still holds.

Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `q` has one less element, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` and 0 for all other vertices.**
