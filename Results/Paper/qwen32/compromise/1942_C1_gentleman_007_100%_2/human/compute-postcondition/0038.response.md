To determine how to adjust the state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition:

```python
while len(q):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as the length of `q` is greater than 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `q` must not be empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ver` is the last vertex that was processed.
- `q` contains all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` in BFS order, with the initial `ver` removed.
- `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` and 0 for all other vertices.

To make sure the loop can execute one more time, `q` must contain at least one vertex. Since `ver` is not part of the final output state and changes with each iteration, we don't need to adjust it. We only need to ensure that `q` is not empty.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `q` contains at least one vertex.

State: **`ver` will be the last vertex that was processed, `q` must contain at least one vertex, `vis` will be a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` and 0 for all other vertices.**
