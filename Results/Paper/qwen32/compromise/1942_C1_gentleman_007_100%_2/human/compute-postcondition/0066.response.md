Output State: **The `dp` matrix is fully populated with the lengths of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between all prefixes of `a` and `b`. The value at `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the LCS between the entire lists `a` and `b`. `i` is 0. `j` is 1. The list `l` either contains the element `a[0]` if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, or it remains an empty list if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `i` has been decremented by 1, so `i` is now 0. The values of `dp`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged.
