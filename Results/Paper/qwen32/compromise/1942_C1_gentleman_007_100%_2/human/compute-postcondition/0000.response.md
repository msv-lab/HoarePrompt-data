The code snippet creates a new deque object named `q`. This does not affect the values of `ver`, `graph`, or `vis`. The output state is that `q` is now an empty deque, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where each key (or index) is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is an empty deque.**
