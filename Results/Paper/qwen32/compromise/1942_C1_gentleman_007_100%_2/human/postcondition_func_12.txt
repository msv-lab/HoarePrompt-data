The function accepts an integer `n` greater than or equal to 2 and returns a dictionary representing the prime factorization of `n`. The specific return postcondition given in the example is `{2: 3, 3: 3}`, which indicates that `n` was 72 (2^3 * 3^3) in that case. However, the function will return the correct prime factorization for any valid input `n`.
