Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This indicates the number of test cases, but it does not affect the current print statement.
2. `n`, `f`, `k` are integers read from the input.
3. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
4. `favorite_value` is the value at index `f - 1` in the list `a`.
5. `sorted_a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list `a`.
6. `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.
7. `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`.
8. The current value of `removed_count` is equal to the current value of `favorite_count`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or expressions in this statement that need to be evaluated or replaced based on the initial state. The condition `removed_count == favorite_count` is provided in the initial state, but it does not influence the print statement itself since the print statement is static and does not depend on any of the variable values.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
