Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `f`, `k` are the three integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list `a`; `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`; `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`. The current value of `removed_count` is equal to the current value of `favorite_count`.**
