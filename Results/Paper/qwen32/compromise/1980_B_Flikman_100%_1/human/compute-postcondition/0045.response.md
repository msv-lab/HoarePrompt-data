Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order, `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire `sorted_a` list.**

In this output state, the value of `favorite_count` has been updated to reflect the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire `sorted_a` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
