Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, `k` are the three integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list `a`, and `removed_count` is 2 if `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`; otherwise, `removed_count` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the `removed_count` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
