Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `f`, `k` <= `n` <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which is expected to be within the range of 1 to 1000. The other variables (`n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
