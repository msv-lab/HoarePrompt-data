Postcondition: **`t` is `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order, `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire `sorted_a` list. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, then `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count` and if `removed_count` is greater than 0, it indicates that `favorite_value` appears more times in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a` than in the rest of the list. If `removed_count` is 0, it indicates that `favorite_value` does not appear in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.**
