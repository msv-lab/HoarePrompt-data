Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440. For each test case, it accepts a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm). The function returns the time converted to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation for each test case.**
