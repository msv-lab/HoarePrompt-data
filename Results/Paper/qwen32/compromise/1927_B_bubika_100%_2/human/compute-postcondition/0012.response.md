The code `r += a[x]` appends the character at index `x` of string `a` to the string `r`. Given that `x` is 0 and `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the character at index 0 is 'a'. Therefore, `r` will be 'a' + 'a' which results in 'aa'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros except `b[0]` which is 1, `s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `r` is the string 'aa', `x` is 0, `i` is 1**.
