The given code snippet attempts to compute `mod_x` using the expression `num % x`. However, there is no variable `num` defined in the initial state. Assuming that `num` should be one of the variables provided in the initial state, let's assume `num` is intended to be `n` since `n` is mentioned as a parameter extracted from `case['params']`.

Given this assumption, the code would compute `mod_x` as `n % x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`.**
