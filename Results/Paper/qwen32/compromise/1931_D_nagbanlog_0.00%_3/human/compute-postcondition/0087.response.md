To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This represents the number of test cases).
   - `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
     - `n` is the length of the array `a`.
     - `x` and `y` are integers used for modulo operations.
     - `a` is the array of integers.
   - `results` is a list that stores the final `beautiful_count` for each test case.
   - `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted from `case['params']`.
   - `a` is `case['array']`.
   - `freq` is a dictionary that counts occurrences of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
   - `beautiful_count` is the total count of beautiful pairs found in the current test case.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement outputs a formatted string that includes the value of `beautiful_count`.
   - `beautiful_count` is the result of counting the number of "beautiful pairs" in the current test case.
   - The exact value of `beautiful_count` depends on the specific test case being processed, including the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the contents of `a`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `beautiful_count`.
   - However, we know that `beautiful_count` is the total count of beautiful pairs found in the current test case.

Thus, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: beautiful_count (where beautiful_count is the total count of beautiful pairs found in the current test case)**
