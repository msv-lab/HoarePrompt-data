Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. The current value of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists as a key in `freq`.**
