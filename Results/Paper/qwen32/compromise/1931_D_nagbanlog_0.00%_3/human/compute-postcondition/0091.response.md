The code snippet provided assigns the value of `case['array']` to the variable `a`. No other variables are modified in this code snippet.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `a` now holds the value of `case['array']`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for the current test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0**.
