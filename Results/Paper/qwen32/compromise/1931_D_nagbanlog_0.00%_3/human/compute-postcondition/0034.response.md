The code calculates `required_mod_x` based on the current `num`, `x`, and `mod_x`. The value of `required_mod_x` is set to `(x - mod_x) % x`.

Given the initial state, `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `num`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `required_mod_x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`, `freq` has the count of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.**
