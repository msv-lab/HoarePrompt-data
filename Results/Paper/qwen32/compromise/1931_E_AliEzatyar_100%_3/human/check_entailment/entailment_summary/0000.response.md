Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the described game. The main issues are:

1. The function `func_1` is incorrectly implemented. Instead of counting the trailing zeros in a string representation of a number, it counts trailing '0' characters in a list of strings, which is not the intended behavior. The function should count the trailing zeros in a single string representation of a number, not a list of strings.

2. The logic used to determine the winner is flawed. The program calculates `total_digits` as the sum of the lengths of the string representations of the numbers in the list. It then calculates `subtract_zero` based on the number of trailing zeros in each number, but the way it does this is incorrect and does not align with the rules of the game.

3. The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is not a correct way to determine the winner based on the game's rules. The game's outcome depends on the final number formed after all possible moves, not on the difference between the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game according to the provided problem description and rules.

Correctness: **False**
