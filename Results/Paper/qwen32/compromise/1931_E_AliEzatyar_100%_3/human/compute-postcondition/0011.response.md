The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the indices of the list `num` in reverse order, starting from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i - 1`. This means that to execute the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 (since `i` is decremented at the end of each iteration).

Given that the loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`, the next value of `i` should be one more than its current value, but still within the bounds of the list.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop runs from `len(num) - 1` to `0`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1.
3. To execute the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one element. If `num[i]` was '0', then `counter` is 2, otherwise `counter` remains 1. `i` is `i + 1`. If `num[i]` was not '0', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
