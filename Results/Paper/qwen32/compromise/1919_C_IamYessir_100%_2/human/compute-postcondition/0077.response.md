The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. As a result, the list `b` will have an additional element, which is `lit[i]`.

Given the initial state, the value of `i` is `i + 2`, but since we do not have a specific value for `i`, we will refer to it as `i + 2` in the output state. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `y` remains unchanged as well unless `b` was empty before this operation, but since we are appending an element to `b`, `y` will now be the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is the last element of `lit` or `float('inf')` if `lit` is empty, `b` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it, and `y` is `lit[i]`.**
