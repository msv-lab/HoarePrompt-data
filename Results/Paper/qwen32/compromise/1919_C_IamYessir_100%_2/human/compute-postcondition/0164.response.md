Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not. `cp` is 0. `n` is greater than 0. If `x == y`, then `a` is not an empty list and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x < y`, `x` and `y` retain their values. If `x >= lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x < lit[i]`, then `lit[i]` is added to the end of `b` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**

This postcondition summarizes the changes to the variables `a`, `b`, `cp`, `n`, `x`, and `y` based on the conditions in the if-else block.
