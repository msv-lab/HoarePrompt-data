The code snippet provided explicitly sets the variable `x` to `float('inf')`, regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is `float('inf')`. If the list `lit` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`.**
