Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**
