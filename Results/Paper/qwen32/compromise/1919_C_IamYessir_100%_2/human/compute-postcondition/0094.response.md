Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the number of elements in `lit`, `lit` is the input list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists of integers populated based on the conditions described, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, `s` is 0.**

The variable `s` has been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as they were not affected by the executed code.
