The code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means the list `b` will now have an additional element, which is `lit[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` also remain unchanged unless they were dependent on the state of `b` or `lit` which they are not in this context.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If the list `lit` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`. The list `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
