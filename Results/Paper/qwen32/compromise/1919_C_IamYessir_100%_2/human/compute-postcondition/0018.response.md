The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This affects the list `b` directly, making it longer by one element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `b` is a list that may or may not be empty, and `lit` is a list of integers. After executing `b.append(lit[i])`, `b` will have one additional element, which is `lit[i]`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is greater than `y`. The current value of `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`. `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
