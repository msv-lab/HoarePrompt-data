The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `cp`, `n`, `i`, or `x`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')`.**
