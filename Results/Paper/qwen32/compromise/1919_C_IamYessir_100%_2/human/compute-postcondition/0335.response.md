Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is the length of the input list `lit`, `lit` is the list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `b` are lists containing elements from `lit` based on the loop's comparison logic, and if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.**
