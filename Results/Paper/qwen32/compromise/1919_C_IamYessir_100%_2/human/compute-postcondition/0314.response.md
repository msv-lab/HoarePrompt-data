The code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 3, the element `lit[3]` is appended to `b`.

The output state of the variables will be as follows:
- `iterations` remains 2.
- `n` remains greater than 3.
- `lit` remains a list of integers converted from the input string.
- `cp` remains 0.
- `i` remains 3.
- `x` remains `float('inf')` if the length of `a` is 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise.
- `y` remains `float('inf')` if the length of `b` was 0 before the append operation, or the last element of list `b` before the append operation otherwise.
- `b` now includes the element `lit[3]` at the end.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is `float('inf')` if the length of `a` is 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')` if the length of `b` was 0 before the append operation, or the last element of list `b` before the append operation otherwise, `b` includes the element `lit[3]` at the end.**
