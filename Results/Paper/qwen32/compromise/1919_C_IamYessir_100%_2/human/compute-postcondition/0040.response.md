The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This operation modifies the list `b` by adding a new element to it, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `x`, or `y`.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the list `b` now contains an additional element, which is `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`, and the current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`. `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` which in turn is greater than `x`. `b` now contains `lit[i]` as its last element.**
