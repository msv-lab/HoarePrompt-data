Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3. If `x < y`, `lit[3]` is appended to `a` if `x >= lit[3]` or `x < lit[3]` and `lit[3] > y`. If `x < y` and `y >= lit[3]` and `lit[3] > x`, `lit[3]` is appended to `b`. If `x >= y`, no elements are appended to `a` or `b`.**

This postcondition summarizes the changes to the lists `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the if statement.
