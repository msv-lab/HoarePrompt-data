Postcondition: **`a` is [5, 8, 6], `b` is [3, 2], `cp` is 0, `n` is 5, `s` is 1 if `a[i] > a[i - 1]` (which means `a[3] > a[2]` or `6 > 6` is false, but since `i` is 3 and `a[3]` is out of bounds, the condition is evaluated as `a[2] > a[1]` or `6 > 8` is false, so the else part does not apply here, but if the condition were true, `s` would be 1). Otherwise, `s` remains 0.** 

However, since the provided `i` value of 3 is out of bounds for array `a`, the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` cannot be evaluated as intended. Assuming the intention was to compare valid indices, the corrected postcondition would be:

Postcondition: **`a` is [5, 8, 6], `b` is [3, 2], `cp` is 0, `n` is 5. If `a[i] > a[i - 1]` (where `i` is a valid index such that `0 < i < len(a)`), then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.** 

Given the provided `i` value of 3, which is out of bounds, the condition cannot be evaluated, and the state of `s` remains 0. Therefore, the final postcondition is:

Postcondition: **`a` is [5, 8, 6], `b` is [3, 2], `cp` is 0, `n` is 5, `s` is 0.**
