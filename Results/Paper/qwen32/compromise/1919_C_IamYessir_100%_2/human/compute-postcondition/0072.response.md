The code snippet `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. This means that the value of `x` will now be the last element of the list `a`, regardless of the previous value of `x`.

Based on the initial state provided, the following variables and their conditions are still valid:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is greater than 0
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is `i + 2`
- The condition for `x` based on the list `lit` and for `y` based on the list `b` are still valid but not directly affected by this line of code

The only change is that `x` is now the last element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is the last element of the list `a`. If the list `lit` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`.**
