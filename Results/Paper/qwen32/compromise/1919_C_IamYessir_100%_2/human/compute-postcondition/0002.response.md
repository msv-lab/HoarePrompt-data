The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list of integers to the variable `lit`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
