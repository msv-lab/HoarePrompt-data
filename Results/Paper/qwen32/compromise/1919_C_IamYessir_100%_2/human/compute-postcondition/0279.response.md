Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `x` remains the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is either positive infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty), and `x` is less than `y`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` includes all its previous elements plus `lit[i]` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `b` and `y` remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is less than `lit[i]`.**
