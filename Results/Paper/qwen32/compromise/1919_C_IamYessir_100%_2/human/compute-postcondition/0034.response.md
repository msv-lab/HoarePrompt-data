Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`, and the current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
a.append(lit[i])
```

This line of code appends the `i`-th element of `lit` to the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `a` now includes the element `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list that now includes `lit[i]`, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` was an empty list before the operation, or the last element of `a` if `a` was not an empty list before the operation, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is less than `y`, and the current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the list `a` now contains the additional element `lit[i]`, while all other variables retain their original values.
