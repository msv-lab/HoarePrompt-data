Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `lit[i] > x`, then `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i] > y` and `x` is the last element of `a`, then `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**
