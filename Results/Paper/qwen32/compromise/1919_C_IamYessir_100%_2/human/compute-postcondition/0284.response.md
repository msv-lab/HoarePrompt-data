The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` must have been 1 (since `iterations` indicates the number of completed iterations). For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The value of `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2**
