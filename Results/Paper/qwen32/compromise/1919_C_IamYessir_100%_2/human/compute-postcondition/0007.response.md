The variable `x` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. This does not affect the values of any other variables. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, and `cp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, and `x` is `float('inf')`.**
