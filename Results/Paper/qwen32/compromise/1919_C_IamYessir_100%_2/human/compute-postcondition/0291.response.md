The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index 2 of `lit` is added to `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `iterations`, `n`, `cp`, `x`, or `y`. The only change is in the list `b`.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is either `float('inf')` if the length of `a` is 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise, and `y` is `float('inf')` if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of list `b` otherwise. The list `b` has an additional element which is `lit[2]`.**
