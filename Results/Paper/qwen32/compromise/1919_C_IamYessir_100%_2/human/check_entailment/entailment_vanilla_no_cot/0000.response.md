Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum possible penalty. The algorithm's approach to splitting the array into subsequences `s` and `t` is flawed and does not guarantee the minimum penalty. The logic for deciding whether to add an element to `s` or `t` is incorrect and does not consider the optimal way to minimize the penalties `p(s)` and `p(t)`.

The correct approach involves recognizing that the minimum penalty is achieved by splitting the array into two subsequences such that one of them is empty, as this will result in a penalty of 0 for that subsequence. The optimal strategy is to place all elements in one subsequence and the other subsequence remains empty, which guarantees a penalty of 0 for the empty subsequence and the penalty of the non-empty subsequence is simply the number of increasing pairs in that subsequence.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        penalty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if lit[i] > lit[i - 1]:
                penalty += 1
        print(penalty)

func()
```

This program calculates the penalty of the entire array as one subsequence and the other subsequence as empty, which is the optimal solution.
