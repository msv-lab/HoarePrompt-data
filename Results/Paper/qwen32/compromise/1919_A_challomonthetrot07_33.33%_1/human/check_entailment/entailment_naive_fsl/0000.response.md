Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Program Analysis

The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins until one of them cannot make a move. The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategy for both players.

#### Key Points:
1. **Optimal Strategy**:
    - If `a == b`, the player who starts (Alice) will always lose because no matter what they do, they will eventually reach a state where both wallets have the same number of coins, and the opponent will force them to lose.
    - If `a == 1` or `b == 1`, the player who starts with 1 coin will lose because they cannot remove a coin from their wallet.
    - If `a % 2 == 1` (odd) and `b % 2 == 0` (even), Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.
    - If `a % 2 == 0` (even) and `b % 2 == 1` (odd), Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.
    - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the strategy is more complex, but generally, the player who starts with the larger number of coins can force a win.
    - If both `a` and `b` are even and `a > b`, Bob can force Alice into a losing position by mirroring her moves.
    - If both `a` and `b` are even and `a < b`, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by mirroring his moves.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Condition for `a % 2 == 1`**: This condition is incorrect. If `a` is odd and `b` is even, Alice can force Bob into a losing position, not Bob.
2. **Condition for `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**: This condition is also incorrect. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Bob can force Alice into a losing position, not Alice.
3. **Conditions for `a > b` and `a < b` when both are even**: These conditions do not properly account for the mirroring strategy that can force a win for the larger number of coins.

### Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of Incorrectness:
The provided program incorrectly handles cases where `a` and `b` have different parities (odd/even) and when both are even but not equal. Here is a counterexample:

- **Counterexample**: `a = 3`, `b = 2`
    - According to the program, the output will be `Bob` because `a % 2 == 1`.
    - However, Alice can swap wallets, making `a = 2` and `b = 3`. Then, Bob will be forced into a losing position because he will always be left with an odd number of coins while Alice can always mirror his moves until Bob cannot make a move.

Thus, the program does not correctly determine the winner for every potential case, making it incorrect.
