Let's analyze the logic of the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Base Case: a == b**
   - If Alice and Bob have the same number of coins, Alice will always lose if both play optimally. This is because no matter what Alice does, Bob can mirror her moves, and Alice will end up in a position where she cannot make a move first. Hence, the program correctly prints 'Bob'.

2. **Case: a == 1**
   - If Alice has only one coin, she will lose because she can only take one coin out of her wallet, leaving Bob with the same number of coins as before. Bob can then mirror Alice's moves and win. The program correctly prints 'Alice'.

3. **Case: b == 1**
   - If Bob has only one coin, the logic is similar to the previous case. Alice can swap wallets with Bob, leaving Bob with no coins and Alice with the same number of coins. Alice can then mirror Bob's moves and win. The program correctly prints 'Bob'.

4. **Case: a % 2 == 1 (a is odd)**
   - If Alice has an odd number of coins, she can always leave Bob with an even number of coins after her first move by swapping wallets if necessary. Bob will then be in a position where he has an even number of coins, and Alice can always mirror his moves to ensure that she wins. The program correctly prints 'Bob'.

5. **Case: a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1 (a is even and b is odd)**
   - If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice can always leave Bob with an even number of coins after her first move by swapping wallets if necessary. Bob will then be in a position where he has an even number of coins, and Alice can always mirror his moves to ensure that she wins. The program correctly prints 'Alice'.

6. **Case: a > b**
   - The program prints 'Bob' if Alice has more coins than Bob. However, this does not necessarily mean Bob will win. If Alice has more coins, she can swap wallets to put Bob in a more disadvantageous position, but the logic needs to consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the coins, which is already handled by the previous cases. This case does not cover all scenarios and can lead to incorrect results.

7. **Case: else (a < b)**
   - The program prints 'Alice' if Bob has more coins than Alice. Similar to the previous case, this does not necessarily mean Alice will win. Bob can swap wallets to put Alice in a more disadvantageous position, but the logic needs to consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the coins, which is already handled by the previous cases. This case does not cover all scenarios and can lead to incorrect results.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not correctly handle all scenarios, especially when comparing `a > b` and `a < b` without considering the parity of the coin counts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
