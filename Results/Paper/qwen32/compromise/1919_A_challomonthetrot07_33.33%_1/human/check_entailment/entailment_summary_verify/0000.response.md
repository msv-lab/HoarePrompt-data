### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Optimal Strategy**:
    - If `a == b`, Alice will lose because both players will eventually reach a state where they cannot make a move.
    - If `a == 1` or `b == 1`, the player with 1 coin will lose because they cannot remove a coin.
    - If `a % 2 == 1` and `b % 2 == 0`, Alice can force Bob into a losing position.
    - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, Bob can force Alice into a losing position.
    - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the player who starts with the larger number of coins can force a win.
    - If both `a` and `b` are even, the player who starts with the smaller number of coins can force a win by mirroring the opponent's moves.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Condition for `a % 2 == 1`**:
    - The program incorrectly prints 'Bob' when `a` is odd and `b` is even. According to the optimal strategy, Alice can force Bob into a losing position in this case.
2. **Condition for `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**:
    - The program incorrectly prints 'Alice' when `a` is even and `b` is odd. According to the optimal strategy, Bob can force Alice into a losing position in this case.
3. **Conditions for `a > b` and `a < b` when both are even**:
    - The program incorrectly prints 'Bob' when `a > b` and 'Alice' when `a < b` if both are even. According to the optimal strategy, the player who starts with the smaller number of coins can force a win by mirroring the opponent's moves.

### Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of Incorrectness:
The provided program does not correctly handle cases where `a` and `b` have different parities and when both are even but not equal. Here are some counterexamples:

- **Counterexample 1**: `a = 3`, `b = 2`
    - According to the program, the output will be `Bob` because `a % 2 == 1`.
    - However, Alice can swap wallets, making `a = 2` and `b = 3`. Then, Bob will be forced into a losing position because he will always be left with an odd number of coins while Alice can always mirror his moves until Bob cannot make a move.

- **Counterexample 2**: `a = 2`, `b = 3`
    - According to the program, the output will be `Alice` because `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`.
    - However, Bob can swap wallets, making `a = 3` and `b = 2`. Then, Alice will be forced into a losing position because she will always be left with an odd number of coins while Bob can always mirror her moves until Alice cannot make a move.

- **Counterexample 3**: `a = 4`, `b = 2`
    - According to the program, the output will be `Bob` because `a > b`.
    - However, Alice can mirror Bob's moves and force Bob into a losing position because both are even and Alice starts with the larger number.

- **Counterexample 4**: `a = 2`, `b = 4`
    - According to the program, the output will be `Alice` because `a < b`.
    - However, Bob can mirror Alice's moves and force Alice into a losing position because both are even and Bob starts with the larger number.

### Final Evaluation:
The program does not correctly determine the winner for every potential case, making it incorrect.

Final: **False**
