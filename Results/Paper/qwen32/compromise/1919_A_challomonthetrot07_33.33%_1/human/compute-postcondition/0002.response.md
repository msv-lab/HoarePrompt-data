To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the logic within the loop for each iteration. The loop processes `T` test cases, and for each test case, it compares two integers `a` and `b` according to specific rules and prints a name ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on these comparisons.

The loop does not modify the variable `T` or any other global variables outside its scope. It only reads input values `a` and `b` for each iteration and prints the result. Therefore, the state of `T` remains unchanged after the loop execution.

Since the loop only prints results and does not store them in any variable that persists after the loop, the output state can be described in terms of what gets printed rather than any variable state.

Output State: **The output state consists of `T` lines, each containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob', determined by the comparisons of the input pairs `a` and `b` for each test case.**
