Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `ans` is `x + y - 1` if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2`. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` as its last element, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty list. `i` is `i + 1`.**
