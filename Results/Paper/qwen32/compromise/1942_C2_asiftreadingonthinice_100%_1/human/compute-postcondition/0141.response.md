Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the count of differences of 2 in `a`. `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their input values, `a` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is a list containing at least one element, for example, `[1]`. Additionally, `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**
