Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, otherwise it is the initial value of `ans` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` was 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`, plus the third element of `a` (new value of `y`), plus `x + y - 2`. `y` is the third element of the sorted list `a`. `ii` is the initial value of `ii` plus `len(a) - 1`. `tt` remains the same. `n` and `x` remain the values read from the input. `a` remains the sorted list of integers read from the input. `tmp` is the sorted list containing the half of the difference for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that differ by an even number but not 2, plus `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and the condition for the else part is met.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus either `i` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`) or the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` was 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`, plus the third element of `a` (new value of `y`), plus `x + y - 2` (if `y` is less than `i - 1`). `y` is the third element of the sorted list `a` minus `i - 1` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`; otherwise, `y` remains the third element of the sorted list `a`. `ii` is the initial value of `ii` plus `len(a) - 1`. `tt` remains the same. `n` and `x` remain the values read from the input. `a` remains the sorted list of integers read from the input. `tmp` is a list that must have at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `i` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` was 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`, plus the third element of `a` (new value of `y`), plus `x + y - 2` (if `y` is less than `i - 1`). `y` is the third element of the sorted list `a` minus `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`; otherwise, `y` remains the third element of the sorted list `a`. `ii` is the initial value of `ii` plus `len(a) - 1`. `tt` remains the same. `n` and `x` remain the values read from the input. `a` remains the sorted list of integers read from the input. `tmp` is a list that must have at least one element, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `i` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` was 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`, plus the third element of `a` (new value of `y`), plus `x + y - 2` (if `y` is less than `i - 1`). If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `y` is updated to the initial value of `y` minus `i - 1`; otherwise, `y` remains the third element of the sorted list `a`. `ii` is the initial value of `ii` plus `len(a) - 1`. `tt` remains the same. `n` and `x` remain the values read from the input. `a` remains the sorted list of integers read from the input. `tmp` is a list that must have at least two elements, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
