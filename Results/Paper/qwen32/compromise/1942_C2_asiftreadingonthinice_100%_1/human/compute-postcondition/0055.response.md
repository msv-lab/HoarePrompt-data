The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The variables `ans`, `ii`, and `tt` are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `y` in the initial state description is updated with the new value read from the input.

Output State: **`ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of all `i` values from `tmp` that were processed, plus the new value of `y`; `y` is the new value read from the input; `ii` is the previous value of `ii` plus 1; `tt` remains the same; `n` is the first value read from the input; `x` is the second value read from the input; `y` is the third value read from the input.**
