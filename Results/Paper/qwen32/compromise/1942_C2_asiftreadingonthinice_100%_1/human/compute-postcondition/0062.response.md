The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial state specifies that `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is 2. These conditions remain unchanged by the code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements. The current value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is 2. `ans` is incremented by 1.**
