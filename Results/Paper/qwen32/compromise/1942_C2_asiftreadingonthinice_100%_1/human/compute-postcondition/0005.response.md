Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers provided by the input, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, sorted in ascending order; `ans` is `x + y - 2`.**

The value of `ans` is now `x + y - 2`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
