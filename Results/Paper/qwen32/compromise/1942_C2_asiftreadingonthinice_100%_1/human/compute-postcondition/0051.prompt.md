Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2 plus 1. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the halves of the differences for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have an even difference but are not 2. If the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a` plus `n` is even and not equal to 2, `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one element. If `y` was initially greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is now `y - (i - 1)` and `ans` is increased by `i`. Otherwise, `y` is less than `i - 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one more element, and `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the previous `i`. If `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by the value of `i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one more element, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `i` and `y` is the previous value of `y` minus `i` plus 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
