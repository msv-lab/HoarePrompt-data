The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `tmp`. This action does not affect the values of `ans`, `y`, `ii`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, or `a`. The only change is that `tmp` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of all `i` values from `tmp` that were processed, plus the new value of `y`, plus `x + y - 2`; `y` is the third element of the sorted list `a`; `ii` is the previous value of `ii` plus 1; `tt` remains the same; `n` is the first value read from the input; `x` is the second value read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `tmp` is an empty list.**
