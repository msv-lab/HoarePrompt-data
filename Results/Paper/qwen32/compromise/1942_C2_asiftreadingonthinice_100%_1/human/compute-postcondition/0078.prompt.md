Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of all `i` values from `tmp` that were processed, plus the new value of `y`, plus `x + y - 2`; `y` is the third element of the sorted list `a`; `ii` is the previous value of `ii` plus 1; `tt` remains the same; `n` is the first value read from the input; `x` is the second value read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even but not equal to 2, `tmp` includes an additional element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 4. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, `ans` is its previous value plus 1. Otherwise, if `(a[4] - a[3]) % 2 == 0`, `tmp` contains the value `(a[4] - a[3]) // 2` appended to it; otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 6 elements, `i` is 5. If `a[5] - a[4] == 2`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[5] - a[4]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` includes the value `(a[5] - a[4]) // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
