The code snippet `ans += y` adds the value of `y` to the current value of `ans`. The initial state describes `ans` as the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of all `i` values from `tmp` that were processed, and `y` as the remaining value of `y` after the loop terminates. After executing the code, `ans` will be updated to include the value of `y`.

Output State: **`ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of all `i` values from `tmp` that were processed, plus `y`; `y` is the remaining value of `y` after the loop terminates.**
