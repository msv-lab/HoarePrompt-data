Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values provided by the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2`. `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values provided by the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input with at least 2 elements. If the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` is even and not equal to 2, `tmp` contains one additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is `x + y - 1 + 1` if the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2 + 1` if the difference is even and not equal to 2, and `ans` is `x + y - 2` if the difference is odd. `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values provided by the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input with at least 2 elements. If the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` is even and not equal to 2, `tmp` contains one additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is updated based on the difference between the 3rd and 2nd elements of `a`. If the difference is 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. If the difference is even and not equal to 2, `ans` is set to `x + y - 2 + 1` and `tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. If the difference is odd, `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their input values, `a` remains a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
