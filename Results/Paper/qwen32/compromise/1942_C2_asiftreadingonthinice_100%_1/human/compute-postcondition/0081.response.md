Postcondition: **`ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` was 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`, plus the third element of `a` (new value of `y`), plus `x + y - 2`; `y` is the third element of the sorted list `a`; `ii` is the initial value of `ii` plus `len(a) - 1`; `tt` remains the same; `n` and `x` remain the values read from the input; `a` remains the sorted list of integers read from the input; `tmp` contains the half of the difference for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that differ by an even number but not 2`; `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2.**
