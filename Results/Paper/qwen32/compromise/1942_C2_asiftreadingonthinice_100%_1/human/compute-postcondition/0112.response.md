The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `tmp`. This action does not affect the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `ans`, `ii`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values provided by the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is an empty list.**
