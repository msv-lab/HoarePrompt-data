Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < number of vertices in `g`, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is in `visited`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `x` is 1.**
