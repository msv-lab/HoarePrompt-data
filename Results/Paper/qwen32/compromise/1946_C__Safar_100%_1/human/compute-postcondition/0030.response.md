Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < number of vertices in `g`, `stack` is `[]`, `visited` is an empty set, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `x` is not in `visited`. If `d[x]` (which is `d[1]`) is greater than or equal to `A`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `d[x]` is updated to `2`.**

In natural language: The variable `x` (which is `1`) has been removed from the `visited` set, making `visited` an empty set. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
