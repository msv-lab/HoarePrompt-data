The code appends a tuple `(node, x)` to the `stack`. Given the initial state, `node` is 3 and `x` is 1. Therefore, the tuple `(3, 1)` is appended to `stack`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where `g[1]` must contain at least one more node, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < number of vertices in `g`, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (3, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is in `visited`. `node` is 3.**
