### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to calculate the area of a square given its four corner coordinates. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the square's corners.

2. **Sorting Coordinates**:
   - The coordinates are sorted. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the coordinates are in a consistent order, making it easier to calculate the side length of the square.

3. **Calculating Side Length**:
   - The program calculates the squared distance between two adjacent corners, specifically between `coord[0]` and `coord[1]`, and between `coord[2]` and `coord[3]`. This is based on the assumption that the sorted list will have the coordinates in such a way that these pairs represent adjacent sides of the square.
   - The squared distance is calculated using the formula \((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2\).

4. **Calculating Area**:
   - The square root of the squared distance is taken to get the actual length of the side.
   - The area of the square is then calculated by multiplying the side length by itself.
   - The result is rounded and printed.

5. **Output**:
   - The area of the square is printed for each test case.

### Verification Against Provided Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Coordinates: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
   - Sorted coordinates: (1, 2), (1, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5)
   - Side length squared (between (1, 2) and (1, 5)): \( (1-1)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 9 \)
   - Side length: \( \sqrt{9} = 3 \)
   - Area: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Coordinates: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
   - Sorted coordinates: (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)
   - Side length squared (between (-1, -1) and (-1, 1)): \( (-1+1)^2 + (1+1)^2 = 4 \)
   - Side length: \( \sqrt{4} = 2 \)
   - Area: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Coordinates: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
   - Sorted coordinates: (17, 11), (17, 39), (45, 11), (45, 39)
   - Side length squared (between (17, 11) and (17, 39)): \( (17-17)^2 + (39-11)^2 = 784 \)
   - Side length: \( \sqrt{784} = 28 \)
   - Area: \( 28 \times 28 = 784 \)

The program correctly calculates the area of the square for all provided test cases.
