The given code snippet initializes the variable `res` to 0. The variables `x_i`, `y_i`, and `n` are mentioned in the initial state but are not affected by this code snippet. The list `coord` is also mentioned but remains empty and unchanged.

Output State: **Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is 0.**
