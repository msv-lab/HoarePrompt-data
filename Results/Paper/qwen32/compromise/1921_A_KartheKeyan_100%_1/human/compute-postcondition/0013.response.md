Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `coord` is a list containing three tuples `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The `coord` list originally contained two tuples `[(x, y), (x, y)]`. After executing the code `coord.append((x, y))`, a new tuple `(x, y)` is added to the list, making it `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.
