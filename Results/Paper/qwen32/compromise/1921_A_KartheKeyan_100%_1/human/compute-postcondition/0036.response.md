Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`**

In this output state, the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, and `i` retain their initial values. The variable `p1` is calculated as the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first elements in the `coord` list. The variable `p2` is calculated as the squared difference between the x-coordinates of the fourth and third elements in the `coord` list, plus the squared difference between the y-coordinates of the fourth and third elements in the `coord` list.
