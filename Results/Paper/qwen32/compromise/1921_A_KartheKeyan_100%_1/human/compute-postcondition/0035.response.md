Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

Explanation: The value of `p1` has been updated to be the squared distance between the points `(coord[0][0], coord[0][1])` and `(coord[1][0], coord[1][1])`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
