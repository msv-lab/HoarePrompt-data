The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This means the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to whatever integers are provided in the input. The other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the current input, `y` is the second integer from the current input, `n` must be at least 2, `coord` is `[]`, `res` is `0`, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**.
