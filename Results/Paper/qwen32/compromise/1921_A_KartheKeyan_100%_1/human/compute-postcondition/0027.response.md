The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 1.

State: **`x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is `[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**
