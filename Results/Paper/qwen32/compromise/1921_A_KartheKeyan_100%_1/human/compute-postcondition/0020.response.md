Output State: **`x` is the fourth integer from the input, `y` is the fourth integer from the input, `n` is a non-zero integer minus 1, `coord` is a sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values as provided in the initial state.
