Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**

Natural language: The `coord` list now contains one tuple with the values of `x` and `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
