To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, let's break down the loop's behavior and how the variables evolve.

The loop runs for a fixed number of 4 iterations, as indicated by `for i in range(4)`. This means the loop will execute exactly 4 times, regardless of the input values or conditions.

Starting from the initial state, the loop performs the following actions in each iteration:
1. It reads a pair of integers `(x, y)` from the input.
2. It appends the pair `(x, y)` to the `coord` list.

Given the initial state:
- `x` and `y` are not yet set (they will be set in the first iteration).
- `n` must be at least 2 (this condition is not affected by the loop).
- `coord` is an empty list `[]`.
- `res` is `0`.
- `i` is `3` (but this will be overwritten by the loop variable `i`).
- `p1` and `p2` are calculated based on elements of `coord` that do not exist initially.

After each iteration:
- `x` and `y` are updated to the new input values.
- `coord` grows by one element, appending the new `(x, y)` pair.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Let's go through the iterations:

1. **First Iteration**:
   - `x, y = map(int, input().split())` → `coord` becomes `[(x1, y1)]`.
   - `i` is set to `0`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `x, y = map(int, input().split())` → `coord` becomes `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2)]`.
   - `i` is set to `1`.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `x, y = map(int, input().split())` → `coord` becomes `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)]`.
   - `i` is set to `2`.

4. **Fourth Iteration**:
   - `x, y = map(int, input().split())` → `coord` becomes `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`.
   - `i` is set to `3`.

After the fourth iteration, the loop ends. Now, let's calculate `p1` and `p2` based on the final `coord` list:
- `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])` → `(x2 - x1)`.
- `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])` → `(x4 - x3)`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `res` is `0`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `n` must be at least 2, `coord` is `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is `0`, `i` is `3`, `p1` is `(x2 - x1)`, `p2` is `(x4 - x3)`**.

In simple terms, after all iterations, `coord` contains four tuples of coordinates, `i` is `3`, and `p1` and `p2` are calculated based on the differences in the x-coordinates of the second and first points, and the fourth and third points, respectively.
