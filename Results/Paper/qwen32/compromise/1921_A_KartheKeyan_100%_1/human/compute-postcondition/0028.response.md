Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is `[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the new input values, but all other variables remain unchanged. The list `coord` gets updated to include the new tuple `(x, y)` as its last element.
