The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `range(4)`, so we can only adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4, but since the loop condition is `i < 4`, the loop will terminate after `i` is 3.

However, to provide the state just before the loop terminates, we increment `i` to 4.

State: **`x` is the first integer from the current input, `y` is the second integer from the current input, `n` must be at least 2, `coord` is `[(x, y)]`, `res` is `0`, `i` is `4`, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**
