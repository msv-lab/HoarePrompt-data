The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of three possible values derived from other entries in the `dp` table. Specifically, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. The variables `i` and `j` are not modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, after executing the provided code, the `dp` table will have its entry at `dp[i][j]` updated, while all other entries and the values of `n`, `cards`, `i`, and `j` remain the same.

Output State: **The `dp` table is fully updated with `dp[i][j]` now equal to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` is `n - 2`.**
