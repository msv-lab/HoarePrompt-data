The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop decrements `j` starting from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`.

To execute one more iteration, `j` needs to be decremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should be `n - 2`.

The states of `dp`, `n`, `cards`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. For each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, if `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[2][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][j]` is `max(dp[2][j], dp[3][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][j]` is the maximum of `dp[2][j]`, `dp[3][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[2][j + 1]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` is `n - 2`.**
