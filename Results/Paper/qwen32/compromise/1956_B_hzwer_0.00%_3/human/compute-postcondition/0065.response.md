The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Given that `i` is `n - 3` and `j` is `n - 2`, the value at `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is now the same as the value at `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`.

The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged. The `dp` table is still fully updated with the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. The values of `i` and `j` remain the same as they were before the assignment, with `i` being `n - 3` and `j` being `n - 2`.

Output State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. For each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, if `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[2][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][j]` is `max(dp[2][j], dp[3][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][j]` is the maximum of `dp[2][j]`, `dp[3][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[2][j + 1]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is equal to `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`. `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` is `n - 2`.**
