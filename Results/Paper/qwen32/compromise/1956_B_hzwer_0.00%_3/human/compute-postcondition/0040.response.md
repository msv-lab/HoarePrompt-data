The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement, `j` is currently `n - 1` and it is being decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given the current state:
- `j` is `n - 1`
- `i` is `1`
- `n` is greater than `0`
- The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations.

For the next iteration, `j` should be `n - 2` (since `j` is decremented by 1).

State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][n - 1]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 1]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][n - 1]` is `max(dp[2][n - 1], dp[3][n - 2] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][n - 1]` is the maximum of `dp[2][n - 1]`, `dp[3][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[2][n]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 2`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
