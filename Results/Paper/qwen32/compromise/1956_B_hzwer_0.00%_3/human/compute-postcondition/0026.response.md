Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, and `j` is `n-3`. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`.**
