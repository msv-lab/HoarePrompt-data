To determine the state needed for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop head:

```
for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
```

The loop will iterate with `i` starting from `n - 3` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches `-1` (exclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value `n - 3` must be greater than or equal to `0`. This means `n` must be at least `3`.

Given the variables in the loop head, we can only adjust `i` and `n`. Since `i` is the loop variable and its value is determined by the range function, we only need to ensure that `n` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute.

The state of `cards` and `dp` does not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the purpose of ensuring the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is at least `3`.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is `0`**
