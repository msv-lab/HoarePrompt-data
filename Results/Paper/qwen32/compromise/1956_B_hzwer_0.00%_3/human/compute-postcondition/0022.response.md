The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the for loop statement, `j` starts from `n-1` and decrements down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `n-2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, and `j` is `n-3`**.
