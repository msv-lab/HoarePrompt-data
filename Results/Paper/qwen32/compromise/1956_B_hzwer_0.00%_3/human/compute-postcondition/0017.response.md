The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. This means that the value at position `[i][j]` in the `dp` list is now the same as the value at position `[i + 1][j]`.

Given that `j` is `n-2` and `n` is at least 3, the value of `dp[i][n-2]` is now set to `dp[i + 1][n-2]`. The values of `n`, `cards`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][n-2]` has been updated to `dp[i + 1][n-2]`, `j` is `n-2`**.
