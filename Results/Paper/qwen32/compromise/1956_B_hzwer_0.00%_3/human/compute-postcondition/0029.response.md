The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 3` to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` decreases by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `0` (the loop would have exited after this iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be initialized to a value that is within the range `[n - 3, 0]`. Since the loop just finished with `i` being `0`, the previous value of `i` must have been `1` (because `i` decreases by 1 in each iteration).

Therefore, to execute one more iteration, `i` should be set to `1`.

State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all values updated according to the loop's logic. `i` is 1**
