In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop. According to the instructions, if it is a `while True` loop, we should simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

Here is the provided state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5
- `t` is an integer such that t = 1
- The tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves.
- The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round.
- `numbers` is an empty list.

Since the loop is `while True`, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, and `numbers` is an empty list.**
