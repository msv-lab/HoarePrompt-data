You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the encoded string, and a string b of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from all strings in `encoded`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the character that is symmetric to it in the `unique_chars` list (i.e., the first character is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on); `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.

    #The program returns a string `decoded` formed by replacing each character in all strings `b` of `encoded` with its symmetric character from `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `b` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a string `decoded` formed by replacing each character in all strings `b` with its symmetric character from a mapping derived from the unique characters in the input strings.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly perform the decoding operation as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program is reversing the mapping process instead of correctly reversing the encoding process.

Here's the issue in detail:

The program constructs a mapping from each character in the encoded string `b` to its symmetric character in the sorted set of unique characters `r`. However, this mapping is incorrect for decoding because it maps each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`, instead of mapping each character in `b` back to its original character in `s`.

For example, consider the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`:
- The unique characters in `b` sorted alphabetically form `r = "cdefors"`.
- The program maps each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`:
  - 's' -> 'c'
  - 'e' -> 'r'
  - 'r' -> 'd'
  - 'o' -> 'f'
  - 'f' -> 'o'
  - 'e' -> 'r'
  - 'd' -> 'c'
  - 's' -> 'c'
  - 'o' -> 'f'
  - 'c' -> 's'
- This results in the decoded string `"codeforces"`, which is correct in this specific case, but this is coincidental and not due to the correct logic.

However, let's consider another example to illustrate the issue:
- Suppose the encoded string `b = "tft"`.
- The unique characters in `b` sorted alphabetically form `r = "ft"`.
- The program maps each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`:
  - 't' -> 'f'
  - 'f' -> 't'
  - 't' -> 'f'
- This results in the decoded string `"ftf"`, which is incorrect. The correct decoded string should be `"ttt"`.

Thus, the program does not correctly decode the string in all cases and hence is incorrect.

To correct the program, we need to map each character in `b` back to its original character in `s` by reversing the encoding process correctly. This would involve mapping each character in `r` to its symmetric character and then using this mapping to decode `b`.
