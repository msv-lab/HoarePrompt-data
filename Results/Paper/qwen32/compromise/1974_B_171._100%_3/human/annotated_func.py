#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the encoded string, and a string b of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: `encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the encoded string, and a string b of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from all strings in `encoded`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the character that is symmetric to it in the `unique_chars` list (i.e., the first character is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on); `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string `decoded` formed by replacing each character in all strings `b` of `encoded` with its symmetric character from `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `b` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a string `decoded` formed by replacing each character in all strings `b` with its symmetric character from a mapping derived from the unique characters in the input strings.
