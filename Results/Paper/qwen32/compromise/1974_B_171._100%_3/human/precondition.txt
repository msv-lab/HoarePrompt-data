encoded is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and its length n satisfies 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5. The length of the list encoded (number of test cases t) satisfies 1 \le t \le 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in encoded does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
