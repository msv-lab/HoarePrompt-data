The provided code snippet has a mistake in it. The line `decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)` attempts to iterate over `encoded`, which is a list of tuples, not a string or a list of characters. This will result in a `TypeError` because `char_map` expects individual characters as keys, not tuples.

However, I will assume the intention was to iterate over each string `b` in the tuples of `encoded` and then over each character `ch` in those strings `b`. Here is the corrected interpretation and the resulting output state:

Corrected Code Interpretation:
```
decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for b in encoded for ch in b[1])
```

This corrected code will iterate over each tuple in `encoded`, extract the string `b` (which is the second element of the tuple, `b[1]`), and then iterate over each character `ch` in that string `b`. It will use `char_map` to find the symmetric character for `ch` and join all these characters into a single string `decoded`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the encoded string, and a string b of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from all strings in `encoded`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the character that is symmetric to it in the `unique_chars` list (i.e., the first character is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on); `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`; `decoded` is a string formed by replacing each character in all strings b of `encoded` with its symmetric character from `char_map`.**

In simpler terms, `decoded` is the final decoded string where each character from the original strings in `encoded` has been replaced by its symmetric counterpart as defined in `char_map`. All other variables retain their initial states.
