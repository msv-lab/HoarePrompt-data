To ensure that the `for` loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `len_unique`. The loop will execute if `len_unique` is greater than 0, as `i` will start from 0 and increment until it reaches `len_unique`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`i`**: This variable will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts, so we don't need to adjust its state explicitly.
2. **`len_unique`**: This variable should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, we need to ensure that `unique_chars` has at least one element.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `unique_chars` is a non-empty list.

State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the encoded string, and a string b of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from all strings in `encoded` and must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is an empty dictionary; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0**.
