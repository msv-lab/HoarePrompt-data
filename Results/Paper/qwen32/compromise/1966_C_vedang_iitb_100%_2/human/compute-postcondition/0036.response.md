To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is `sz` in this case. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `tc`, `mexsize`) should remain unchanged unless they are directly related to the loop variable `sz`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `sz` was the current element being processed from the list `a`. After processing, `sz` would have moved to the next element in the list.

2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `sz` needs to be updated to the next element in the list `a`.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - Since `sz` is the loop variable, it will naturally take the next value from the list `a` in the next iteration.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `tc`, `mexsize`) do not change based on the loop variable `sz` alone. They remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `tc` is `tc + 1`. `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1 to become 2; otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**

However, since `sz` is the loop variable and will automatically take the next value from the list `a`, we don't need to specify the exact value of `sz` in the state description. We just need to indicate that it is the next element in the list `a`.

So, the final state can be described as:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `tc` is `tc + 1`. `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. `mexsize` is either incremented by 1 if `sz` equals `mexsize` or remains the same.**
