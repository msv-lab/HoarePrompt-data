To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how it affects the variable `mexsize`.

The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the sorted list `a`. For each element, if `sz` equals `mexsize`, `mexsize` is incremented by 1. This process continues until all elements in the list `a` have been processed.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Initially, `mexsize` is set to 1.
2. The loop starts iterating through the sorted list `a`.
3. For each element `sz` in `a`, if `sz` matches `mexsize`, `mexsize` is incremented by 1.
4. This means that `mexsize` will keep incrementing as long as the current element `sz` in the list matches the current `mexsize`.
5. Once an element `sz` in the list does not match `mexsize`, `mexsize` will not change further during the remaining iterations of the loop.

The final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`.

Let's summarize the final output state:

- `t` remains the same input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains the same input integer.
- `a` remains the same sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `maxsize` remains the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.**
