Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n`: An input integer.
- `a`: A sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `maxsize`: The maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize`: The smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- It is explicitly stated that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

### Key Observations:
- Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, and it is greater than `maxsize`, this implies that the list `a` must contain all positive integers from 1 up to `maxsize`.
- Given that `mexsize > maxsize`, the smallest positive integer not in the list `a` must be the next integer after `maxsize`, i.e., `mexsize = maxsize + 1`.

### Evaluating the Condition:
- The `print` statement checks whether `mexsize % 2 == 0`:
  - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Alice'.
  - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Bob'.

### Determining the Parity of `mexsize`:
- Since `mexsize = maxsize + 1`, the parity (evenness or oddness) of `mexsize` depends on the parity of `maxsize`:
  - If `maxsize` is even, then `mexsize` is odd (`even + 1 = odd`).
  - If `maxsize` is odd, then `mexsize` is even (`odd + 1 = even`).

### Conclusion:
- The output will depend on whether `maxsize` is even or odd. However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `maxsize`, we can only describe the output in terms of `maxsize`.

Given the above analysis, the output can be described as follows:

- If `maxsize` is even, `mexsize` is odd, and the output will be 'Bob'.
- If `maxsize` is odd, `mexsize` is even, and the output will be 'Alice'.

Since we do not have the exact value of `maxsize`, we cannot determine with certainty whether the output will be 'Alice' or 'Bob'. However, based on the given conditions, we can describe the output precisely in terms of `maxsize`.

Output: **Alice if `maxsize` is odd, Bob if `maxsize` is even (where `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`)**
