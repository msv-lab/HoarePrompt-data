The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`, and `tc`) are not affected by this line of code.

Given that `n` was previously defined and now it is being reassigned, the new value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided by the input. The other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`; `tc` is `tc + 1`.**
