Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `tc` is `tc + 1`. `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1.**
