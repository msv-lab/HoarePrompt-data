The code snippet sets `mexsize` to 1. This means the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` is now explicitly set to 1, regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is 1; `tc` is `tc + 1`.**
