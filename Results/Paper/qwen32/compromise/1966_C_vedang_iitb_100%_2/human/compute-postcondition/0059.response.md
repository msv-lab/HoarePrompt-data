The code increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is the value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the previous value of `mexsize` plus 1.**
