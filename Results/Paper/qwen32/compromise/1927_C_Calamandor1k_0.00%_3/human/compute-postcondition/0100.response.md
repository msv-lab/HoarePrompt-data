Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `len_a` greater than 0, `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input with `len_b` being 0 or any positive integer, `d` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 2. If `len_a > i + 1` and `a[i] <= k`, `count_a` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_a` remains unchanged. If `len_b > i + 1` and `b[i] <= k`, `count_b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_b` remains unchanged.**
