The provided code snippet updates the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` based on the input. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, `count_a`, `count_b`, and `d` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`; `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `d` is `k // 2`.**
