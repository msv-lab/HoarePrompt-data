The code snippet `d = k // 2` assigns the integer division of `k` by 2 to the variable `d`. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `d` with the calculated value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0; `d` is `k // 2`.**
