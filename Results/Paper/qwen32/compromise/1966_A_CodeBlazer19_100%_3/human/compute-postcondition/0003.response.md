Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100, and a list `c` of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 100. The function returns the result for each test case based on the given inputs.**
