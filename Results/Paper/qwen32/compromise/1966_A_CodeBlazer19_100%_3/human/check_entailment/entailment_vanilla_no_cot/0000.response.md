Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. The logic used in the program is flawed because it only considers the maximum count of any single card type and assumes that if this count is at least `k`, the minimum number of cards left will be `k-1`. However, this is not necessarily true for all cases.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the remainder of the count of each card type when divided by `k`. The minimum number of cards left will be the sum of these remainders, because each group of `k` cards can be reduced to `k-1` cards, but any remaining cards (less than `k`) cannot be further reduced.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        min_cards = sum(x % k for x in p)
        print(max(1, min_cards))  # Ensure at least 1 card is left

func()
```

This version calculates the sum of the remainders of the counts of each card type when divided by `k`, and ensures that at least one card is left in the hand.
