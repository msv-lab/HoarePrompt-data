The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an `n Ã— n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates a sum related to the cubes of integers from 1 to `n` and prints this sum along with `2 * n`. It also prints a sequence of `n` lines, each containing two integers followed by a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.
