To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop statement is:

```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if the range `(2, n + 1)` is non-empty. This means that `n + 1` must be greater than 2, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 1.

Let's analyze the given state and determine the necessary adjustments:

- `n` is the integer input provided.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `t` is decremented by 1.
- `sum` is 1.

Only `n` can be adjusted directly in the loop head. The state of `j`, `t`, and `sum` does not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

Given that `j` is `n + 1`, if `n` is greater than 1, then `j` will naturally be greater than 2, but it does not affect the loop execution directly.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
