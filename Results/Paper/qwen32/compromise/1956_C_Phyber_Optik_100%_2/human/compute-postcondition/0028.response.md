The code provided updates the value of `sum` based on the current value of `i`. The expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` simplifies to `i * i * i` or `i**3`. Therefore, `sum` is incremented by `i**3`.

Given that `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and `n` must be greater than 1, the output state will reflect the new value of `sum` after this operation. The values of `n` and `i` remain as per the initial state description, with `i` being incremented for the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `sum` is increased by `i**3`**.
