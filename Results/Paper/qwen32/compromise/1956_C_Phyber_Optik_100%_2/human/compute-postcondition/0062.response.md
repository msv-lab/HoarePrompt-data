To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the code step by step based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is defined as the input integer plus 3.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **First Argument (`2`)**:
   - The first argument in the `print` statement is the integer `2`.

2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - `j` is defined as `input integer + 3`.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` can be rewritten as `n - (input integer + 3) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - input integer - 2`.
   - The exact value of `n - j + 1` depends on the input integer, but it is calculated as `n - (input integer + 3) + 1`.

3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part generates a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive.
   - This sequence is unpacked and each number in the sequence is printed as a separate argument.

### Output Description:
- The first value printed is `2`.
- The second value printed is the result of the expression `n - j + 1`, which is `n - (input integer + 3) + 1`.
- The subsequent values printed are the numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive.

### Final Output:
Given the above breakdown, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **2, n - (input integer + 3) + 1, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and input integer is the provided input to calculate j)**
