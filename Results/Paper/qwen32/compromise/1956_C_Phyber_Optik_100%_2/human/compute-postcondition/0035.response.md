Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is defined as `n + 1`.
- `t` remains unchanged (though it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `sum` is defined as \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\) (though it is also not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's evaluate each part of the print statement:

1. **2**: This is a constant value and will always be printed as `2`.
2. **n - j + 1**: Given that `j` is `n + 1`, we can substitute `j` in the expression:
   \[
   n - (n + 1) + 1 = n - n - 1 + 1 = 0
   \]
   So, `n - j + 1` evaluates to `0`.
3. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**: This will print all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For example, if `n` is 5, this will print `1 2 3 4 5`.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
- The constant `2`.
- The result of `n - j + 1`, which is `0`.
- The numbers from `1` to `n`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **2, 0, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the given integer greater than or equal to 1)**

To make it more specific, let's assume `n` is 5 (as an example):
Output: **2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**

However, since `n` is not explicitly given, we leave it in the general form:
Output: **2, 0, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the given integer greater than or equal to 1)**
