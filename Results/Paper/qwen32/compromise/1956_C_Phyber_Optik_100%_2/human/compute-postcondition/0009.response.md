To solve this, let's calculate the value of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` with `i` being 4.

First, compute `i * i`:
\[ 4 * 4 = 16 \]

Next, compute `(i - 1) * (i - 1)`:
\[ (4 - 1) * (4 - 1) = 3 * 3 = 9 \]

Now, compute `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)`:
\[ 16 - 9 = 7 \]

Finally, compute `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`:
\[ 7 * 4 = 28 \]

The `sum` variable is increased by this result. Initially, `sum` was increased by 15, meaning it was already 15 more than its previous value. Now, it is increased by an additional 28.

So, the new value of `sum` is:
\[ \text{sum} = \text{sum} + 28 \]

Since the initial state only provided that `sum` was increased by 15 and did not give the exact value, we can only say that `sum` is now 43 more than its initial value before the first increment.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4, `sum` is increased by 43**.
