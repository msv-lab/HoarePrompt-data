Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `sum` is calculated as 1 plus the sum of \(2i^2 - i\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). This formula is not used in the print statement, so it is irrelevant for determining the output.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is assigned the value of `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's analyze each part of the print statement:

1. **First Argument: `1`**
   - This is a constant value `1`.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - Since `j` is assigned the value of `n`, `n - j` is `0`.
   - Adding `1` to `0` results in `1`.
   - So, `n - j + 1` evaluates to `1`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive.
   - The asterisk (`*`) operator unpacks this range into individual elements for the `print` function.

### Putting It All Together:
- The first argument is `1`.
- The second argument is `1` (as explained above).
- The third argument is the unpacked range from `1` to `n`.

### Final Output:
- If `n` is 1, then the range is just `[1]`.
- If `n` is 2, then the range is `[1, 2]`.
- If `n` is 3, then the range is `[1, 2, 3]`, and so on.

Since `n` is not explicitly given a value, we describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1, 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the given integer greater than or equal to 1)**
