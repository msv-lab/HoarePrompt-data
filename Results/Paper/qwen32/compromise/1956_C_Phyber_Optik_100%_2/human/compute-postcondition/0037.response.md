Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`n`**: Must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. **`j`**: Is set to 1.
3. **`t`**: Remains unchanged (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
4. **`sum`**: Calculated as \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\) (though `sum` is not used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`1`**: This is a constant value and will be printed as is.
2. **`n - j + 1`**: Given `j` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1 + 1` which is `n`.
3. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**: This will unpack the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and print each number in the sequence.

### Output:
- The first value printed is `1`.
- The second value printed is `n`.
- The remaining values printed are the numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Example:
If `n` is 5, the output will be:
- The first value: `1`
- The second value: `5` (since `n` is 5)
- The remaining values: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` (from the range 1 to 5)

### Final Output:
Output: **1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
