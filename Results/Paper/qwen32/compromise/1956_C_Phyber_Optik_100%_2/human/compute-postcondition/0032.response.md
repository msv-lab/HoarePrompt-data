Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `n` remains the same (we don't know the exact value of `n` but it's a constant).
- `j` is `n + 1` (this is a derived value but not used in the print statement).
- `t` remains unchanged (we don't know the exact value of `t` but it's a constant and not used in the print statement).
- `sum` is calculated as \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum, n + n)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `sum`**:
   - `sum` is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\).
   - This formula represents the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers.

2. **Value of `n + n`**:
   - `n + n` simplifies to `2n`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `sum` followed by the value of `2n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sum` and `2n`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **\(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\), 2n (where \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\) is the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers and 2n is twice the value of n)**
