The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. However, the state of `j` and `n` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted directly. The only variable we can adjust is `t`.

Since the loop uses `_` as a throwaway variable, its value does not matter for the loop's execution. The loop will execute `t` times, so for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **the sum is calculated as 1 plus the sum of (2i^2 - i) for i from 2 to n, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is n + 1, `t` is decremented by 1**
