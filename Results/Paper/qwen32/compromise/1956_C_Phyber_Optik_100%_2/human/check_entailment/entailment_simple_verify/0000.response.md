Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the original assessment using the annotated version and the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with zeroes.
2. **Operations**:
   - **Type 1**: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) of integers from 1 to \( n \). Assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \leq j \leq n \).
   - **Type 2**: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) of integers from 1 to \( n \). Assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \leq j \leq n \).
3. **Constraints**:
   - Maximum of \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each test case contains a single integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 500).
   - The sum of \( n^2 \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 5 \cdot 10^5 \).

### Program Analysis:
The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, n + n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

#### Key Points:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum is calculated as \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \).
   - Simplifying the term inside the summation: \( i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1 \).
   - Thus, the sum becomes \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \).
   - This simplifies to \( 1 + 2\sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i \).
   - Using the formulas \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \) and \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), we can verify that the calculated sum is correct.

2. **Operations**:
   - For each row and column, the program performs a Type 1 and Type 2 operation with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This means each row and each column is filled with the sequence \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

#### Verification:
- The sum calculated by the program is correct.
- The operations performed ensure that each row and each column is filled with the sequence \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which is a valid permutation.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:
- **Initialization**: `sum = 1` correctly initializes the sum for \( n = 1 \).
- **Sum Calculation Loop**:
  - For \( n = 2 \):
    - \( \text{sum} = 1 + (2^2 - 1^2) \cdot 2 = 1 + 3 \cdot 2 = 1 + 6 = 7 \).
  - For \( n = 3 \):
    - \( \text{sum} = 1 + (2^2 - 1^2) \cdot 2 + (3^2 - 2^2) \cdot 3 = 1 + 6 + 15 = 22 \).
- **Operations**:
  - For each row and column, the program performs a Type 1 and Type 2 operation with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
  - For \( n = 2 \):
    - Operations:
      - \( 1 \ 2 \ 1 \ 2 \) (Type 1 on row 2)
      - \( 2 \ 2 \ 1 \ 2 \) (Type 2 on column 2)
      - \( 1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 2 \) (Type 1 on row 1)
      - \( 2 \ 1 \ 1 \ 2 \) (Type 2 on column 1)
    - Resulting matrix:
      \[
      \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 2 \\
      1 & 2 \\
      \end{bmatrix}
      \]
    - Sum: \( 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 \) (Incorrect, should be 7).

### Conclusion:
The program calculates the sum correctly but does not fill the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum. The operations do not ensure that the matrix is filled optimally to achieve the maximum possible sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix elements as described in the problem statement. The operations performed do not achieve the optimal configuration of the matrix.
