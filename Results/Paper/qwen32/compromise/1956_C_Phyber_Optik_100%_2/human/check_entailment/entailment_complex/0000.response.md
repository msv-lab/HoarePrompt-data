### Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem by maximizing the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using a limited number of operations. The approach taken in the program seems to be based on a specific strategy for filling the matrix to achieve the maximum sum.

#### Key Points:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of all elements in the matrix using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix in a way that each row and each column contains the numbers from 1 to `n` in a specific permutation.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program outputs `2 * n` operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - Each operation involves filling either a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - Specifically, it performs `n` Type 1 operations (filling rows) and `n` Type 2 operations (filling columns).

3. **Output Format**:
   - For each test case, the program first prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - Then, it prints the sequence of operations, each described by the type of operation, the row/column index, and the permutation used.

#### Analysis:
- **Sum Calculation**:
  - The formula for the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is indeed correct and maximizes the sum of the matrix.
  - The formula can be derived as:
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2
    \]
  - This is a well-known mathematical identity.

- **Operations**:
  - The operations described in the program follow the rules provided in the problem statement.
  - By filling each row and each column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, the program ensures that the maximum possible sum is achieved.
  - The specific permutations used in the program (filling with numbers 1 to `n` in order) are valid and achieve the desired result.

- **Constraints**:
  - The program adheres to the constraint of using no more than `2 * n` operations.
  - The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed `5 * 10^5`, which is manageable within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs the operations required to achieve this sum within the allowed constraints. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
