In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer that satisfies the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The loop uses the underscore `_` as a variable name, which is a common Python convention when the loop variable is not used in the loop body. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. 

Given the loop statement:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The underscore `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is read from the input.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `t` is within the specified range and is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
