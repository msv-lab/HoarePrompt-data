You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even, followed by two strings each of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The output state consists of t lines, each containing either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition that if the second last character of the second string (b) is '<', it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The values of t, n, a, and b are not preserved after the loop execution, but t lines of output are produced as per the described logic.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The robot starts at cell (1, 1).
2. Every second, the robot performs two actions:
   - Moves left, right, down, or up.
   - Moves along the arrow in the current cell.
3. The robot must reach cell (2, n).

### Key Observations:
- The robot starts in the first row.
- To reach the second row, the robot must move down at some point.
- To move down from the first row to the second row, the robot must be in a column where the second row's arrow points right (">"), because:
  - If the arrow points left ("<"), the robot will move left, not down.
  - If the arrow points right (">"), the robot can move down and then right.
- If the robot is in the second row and needs to move right to reach (2, n), the arrows in the second row from that point onwards must all point right (">").

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks the arrow in the second row at column (n-1) (which is the second last column). If this arrow points left ("<"), it prints "No", indicating that the robot cannot reach (2, n). Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

### Flaws in the Program:
- The program only checks the arrow at column (n-1) in the second row.
- This is insufficient because the robot might need to move down from an earlier column and then move right through a sequence of arrows in the second row.
- The program does not account for the possibility that the robot might need to move down from a column other than (n-1) and then follow a sequence of right-pointing arrows to reach (2, n).

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it fails to consider all possible paths the robot can take. It only checks a single condition that is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
