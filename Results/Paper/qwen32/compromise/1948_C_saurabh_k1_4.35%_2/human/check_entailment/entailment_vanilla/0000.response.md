Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The robot starts at cell (1, 1).
2. Every second, the robot performs two actions:
   - Moves left, right, down, or up.
   - Moves along the arrow in the current cell.
3. The robot must reach cell (2, n).

### Key Observations:
- The robot starts in the first row.
- To reach the second row, the robot must move down at some point.
- To move down from the first row to the second row, the robot must be in a column where the second row's arrow points right (">"), because:
  - If the arrow points left ("<"), the robot will move left, not down.
  - If the arrow points right (">"), the robot can move down and then right.
- If the robot is in the second row and needs to move right to reach (2, n), the arrows in the second row from that point onwards must all point right (">").

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks the arrow in the second row at column (n-1) (which is the second last column). If this arrow points left ("<"), it prints "No", indicating that the robot cannot reach (2, n). Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

### Flaws in the Program:
- The program only checks the arrow at column (n-1) in the second row.
- This is insufficient because the robot might need to move down from an earlier column and then move right through a sequence of arrows in the second row.
- The program does not account for the possibility that the robot might need to move down from a column other than (n-1) and then follow a sequence of right-pointing arrows to reach (2, n).

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it fails to consider all possible paths the robot can take. It only checks a single condition that is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
