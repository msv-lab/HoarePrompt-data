You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the second type of operation (appending x copies of the array to the end of the array) correctly. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` only doubles the array, regardless of the value of `x`. For example, if `x` is 3, the array should be repeated three times, not just two.

Let's consider a simple test case to illustrate the issue:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 1
  1 1
  2 3
  1
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

However, if we slightly modify the operations:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 1
  1 1
  2 2
  1
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

But if we use `x = 3`:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 1
  1 1
  2 3
  3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

However, the array after the second operation should be `[1, 1, 1]` if `x = 3`, but the code only doubles the array to `[1, 1]`.

To fix this, the code should be modified to repeat the array `x` times, not just double it. Here is the corrected part of the code:
```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * (value - 1))  # Repeat the array x-1 times
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

With this change, the program should handle all cases correctly.
