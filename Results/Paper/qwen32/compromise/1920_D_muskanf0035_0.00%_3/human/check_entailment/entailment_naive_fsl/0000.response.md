Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the second type of operation (appending x copies of the array to the end of the array) correctly. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` only doubles the array, regardless of the value of `x`. For example, if `x` is 3, the array should be repeated three times, not just two.

Let's consider a simple test case to illustrate the issue:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 1
  1 1
  2 3
  1
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

However, if we slightly modify the operations:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 1
  1 1
  2 2
  1
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

But if we use `x = 3`:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 1
  1 1
  2 3
  3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

However, the array after the second operation should be `[1, 1, 1]` if `x = 3`, but the code only doubles the array to `[1, 1]`.

To fix this, the code should be modified to repeat the array `x` times, not just double it. Here is the corrected part of the code:
```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * (value - 1))  # Repeat the array x-1 times
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

With this change, the program should handle all cases correctly.
