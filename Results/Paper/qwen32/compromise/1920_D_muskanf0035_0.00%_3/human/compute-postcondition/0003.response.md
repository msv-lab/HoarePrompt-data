The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations. `operations` is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers, `b` and `x`, describing the type and value of each operation. `queries` is a list of positive integers representing the queries. The functionality of the function is to process the operations on some underlying data structure (implied but not specified) and then answer the queries based on the results of those operations.
