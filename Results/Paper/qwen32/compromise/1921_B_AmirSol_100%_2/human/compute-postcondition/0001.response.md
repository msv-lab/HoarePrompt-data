Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `cats_to_add` is the count of positions where `s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1', `cats_to_remove` is the count of positions where `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`.**

In simple terms, the output state remains the same for `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. The variable `cats_to_add` retains its initial value as the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1'. A new variable `cats_to_remove` has been introduced and is set to the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.
