The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `k` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a modified list where each element is the product of all elements in `k` divided by the element itself. It then checks if the sum of the modified list is greater than or equal to the product of the original list. If so, it outputs `-1`; otherwise, it outputs the modified list elements separated by spaces.
