### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of outcomes) and a list `k` of multipliers.

2. **Calculating Product:**
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.

3. **Distributing Bets:**
   - For each outcome `i`, it sets the bet `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`.
   - This means that the bet for each outcome is the product of all other multipliers.
   - It then sums up all these bets to get `sumo`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If `sumo` (the total amount bet) is greater than or equal to `prod` (the product of all multipliers), it prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to come out ahead.
   - Otherwise, it prints the calculated bets.

### Analysis:

- **Feasibility Condition:** The condition `sumo < prod` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. This is because, for any winning outcome `i`, the amount received is `k[i] * a[i]`, which equals `prod`. Since `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` values, `sumo < prod` guarantees that `sumo < k[i] * a[i]` for any `i`.

- **Bet Calculation:** The bet for each outcome `i` is set to `prod // a[i]`. This ensures that the total amount bet (`sumo`) is indeed less than `prod` because:
  \[
  \text{sumo} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(\frac{\prod_{j=1}^{n} k_j}{k_i}\right) = \prod_{j=1}^{n} k_j \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k_i}\right) - \prod_{j=1}^{n} k_j
  \]
  Given that each `k_i >= 2`, the sum of reciprocals is less than 1, ensuring `sumo < prod`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - When all `k_i` are the same, `prod // a[i]` will be the same for all `i`, and the sum will be `n * (prod // k_i)`. Since `prod // k_i < prod / k_i` and `n * (prod / k_i) = prod`, the condition `sumo < prod` holds.
  - When `k_i` values vary, the same logic applies, and the condition `sumo < prod` still holds.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and checks if it's possible to come out ahead. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
