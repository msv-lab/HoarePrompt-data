To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `ans` is a string containing the string representations of the first `bets` elements of `a`, each followed by a space.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is constructed from the list `a`. It includes the string representations of the first `bets` elements of `a`, with each element followed by a space.
- Since the exact contents of `a` and the value of `bets` are not specified, we cannot provide a specific sequence of numbers or characters. However, we can describe the structure of `ans` based on the given information.

### Explanation:
- `ans` is a string that contains the string representations of the first `bets` elements of `a`, each followed by a space.
- For example, if `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `bets` is `3`, then `ans` would be `"1 2 3 "`.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(ans)` statement will output a string that consists of the string representations of the first `bets` elements of `a`, each followed by a space.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string containing the string representations of the first `bets` elements of `a`, each followed by a space)**
