Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` remains the same, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `sumo` is 0, `T` is `T + 1`, `a` remains the same list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is `bets`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `sumo` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
