The code snippet sets `sumo` to 0. This affects the value of `sumo` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is now a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `sumo` is 0.**
