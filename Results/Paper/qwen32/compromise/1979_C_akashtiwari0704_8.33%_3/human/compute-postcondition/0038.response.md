The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `bets`, `prod`, or `sumo`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is now a list of integers read from the input, `prod` remains the product of the original first `bets` elements of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the updated first `bets` elements of `a`.**
In natural language: The list `a` is now populated with integers from the input, while all other variables retain their previous values.
