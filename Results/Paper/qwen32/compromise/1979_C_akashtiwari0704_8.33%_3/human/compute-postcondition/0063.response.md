The code snippet appends the string representation of the first element of the list `a` followed by a space to the string `ans`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` was an empty string, and `i` was 0. After executing the line `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '`, `ans` will now contain the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `bets` ≤ `n`, `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are updated to `prod // a[i]` and other elements remain unchanged, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of `a`. Additionally, `sumo` is less than `prod`; `ans` is a string containing `str(a[0]) + ' '`, `i` is 0**.
