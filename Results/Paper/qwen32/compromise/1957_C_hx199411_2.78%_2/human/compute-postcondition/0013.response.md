The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `c` and `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged unless `i` was previously defined and the condition `c == r` affects `num`.

Given the initial state, `c` and `r` are updated to the values read from the input. The value of `num` is determined based on whether `c` equals `r`. If they are equal, `num` is set to 1; otherwise, `num` is set to 2. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 if `c` does not equal `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r` otherwise `num` is 2, `i` is `i + 1` if `c` does not equal `r`**.
