To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `num` based on the values of `c` and `r` provided in each iteration.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (remains unchanged).
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 (remains unchanged).
   - `k` is the number of iterations the loop will perform (remains unchanged).
   - `num` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `k-1`, the loop reads two integers `c` and `r`.
   - If `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1.
   - If `c` does not equal `r`, `num` is incremented by 2.

3. **Final State**:
   - After `k` iterations, `num` will have been incremented by either 1 or 2 for each iteration, depending on whether `c` equaled `r` or not.
   - The final value of `num` will be the sum of these increments.

Given that the loop runs `k` times, and each iteration either adds 1 or 2 to `num`, the final value of `num` can be calculated as follows:

- Let `x` be the number of iterations where `c` equals `r`.
- Let `y` be the number of iterations where `c` does not equal `r`.
- Clearly, `x + y = k`.
- The final value of `num` will be `x * 1 + y * 2 = x + 2y`.

Since `x + y = k`, we can rewrite the equation as:
- `num = x + 2y = (k - y) + 2y = k + y`.

Thus, the final value of `num` is `k + y`, where `y` is the number of iterations where `c` did not equal `r`.

However, without specific values of `c` and `r` for each iteration, we can only express the final state in terms of `k` and `y`. But generally, the final value of `num` is simply the sum of all increments.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `num` will be the total count of 1s added when `c` equals `r` plus twice the count of 2s added when `c` does not equal `r`.
