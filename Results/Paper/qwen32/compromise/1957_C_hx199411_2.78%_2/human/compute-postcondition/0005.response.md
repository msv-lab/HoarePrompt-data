To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(k):`, which means the variables `i` and `k` are relevant.

Here's the analysis:

- The variable `i` is the loop counter and is automatically initialized by the `range` function. We don't need to adjust its initial value because it will be set to 0 when the loop starts.
- The variable `k` determines how many times the loop will iterate. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This variable is not used in the loop head and thus does not need adjustment.)
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n (We need to ensure `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.)
- `num` is 0 (This variable is not used in the loop head and thus does not need adjustment.)

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0**
