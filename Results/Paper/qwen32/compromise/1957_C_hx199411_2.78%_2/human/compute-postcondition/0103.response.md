Given the code snippet `num += 1`, the value of `num` will be incremented by 1. 

Let's break down the initial state and the effect of the code:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is at least 1.
- `m` is 0 or 1 or any other value (if `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of 6 zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81).
- `c` is the first integer from the new input.
- `r` is the second integer from the new input.
- `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`; otherwise, `num` is 3.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

After executing `num += 1`:
- If `num` was 2, it will now be 3.
- If `num` was 3, it will now be 4.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is at least 1, `m` is 0 or 1 or any other value (if `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of 6 zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81), `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`; otherwise, `num` is 4, `i` is incremented by 1.**
