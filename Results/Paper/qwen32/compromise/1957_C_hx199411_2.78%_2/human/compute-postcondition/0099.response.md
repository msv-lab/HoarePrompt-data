The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial conditions, `num` could be either 1 or 2. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` starts as 1 and becomes 3 after the increment. If `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` starts as 2 and becomes 4 after the increment.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `r`, `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is at least 1, `m` is 0 or 1 or any other value (if `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of 6 zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81), `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4, `i` is incremented by 1 if `c` does not equal `r`.**
