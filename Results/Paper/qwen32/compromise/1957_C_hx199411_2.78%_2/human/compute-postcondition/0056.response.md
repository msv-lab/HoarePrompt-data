The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` is initially set to 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2. After the increment, if `num` was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if `num` was initially 2, it becomes 3.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is `n`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r` otherwise `num` is 3, `i` is `i + 1`.**
