Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the number of iterations from the input, `m` is `n - num`, and `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`. If `m` is 0, no further changes are made. If `m` is 1, no further changes are made. If `m` is at least 5, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81.**
