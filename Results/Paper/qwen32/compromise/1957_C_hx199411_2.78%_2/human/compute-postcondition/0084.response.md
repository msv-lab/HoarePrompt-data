Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2`. If `m` is 0, then `m` remains 0. Otherwise, if `m` is 1, `m` remains 1. For any other value of `m`, `m` is set to 5 and `dp` is a list of 6 zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81.**
