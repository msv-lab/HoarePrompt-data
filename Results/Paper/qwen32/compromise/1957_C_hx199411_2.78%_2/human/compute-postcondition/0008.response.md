Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 1, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, and `c` equals `r`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
