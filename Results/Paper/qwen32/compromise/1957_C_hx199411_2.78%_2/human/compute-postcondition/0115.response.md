The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the second element (index `1`) of the list `dp`. This means that `dp[1]` is now `1`, while all other elements of `dp` remain `0`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the number of iterations from the input, `m` is `n - num`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`, and `m` is not equal to 0 or 1; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1.**
