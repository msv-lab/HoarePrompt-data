To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the given information.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `k` times.
- In each iteration, two integers `c` and `r` are read from the input.
- If `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1.
- If `c` does not equal `r`, `num` is incremented by 2.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `num` is initialized to 0.
- `m` is set to `n`.
- If `m` is 0 or 1, no further action is taken (though `m` is greater than 2 in this case).

### Iteration Details:
- After 1 iteration: `num` is either 1 or 2.
- After 2 iterations: `num` is either 2 or 4.
- After 3 iterations: `num` is either 3 or 6.

### General Pattern:
- For each iteration, `num` increases by either 1 or 2.
- Therefore, after `k` iterations, `num` will be the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains `t - 1` (unchanged).
- `n` remains the first integer from the input (unchanged).
- `k` remains the second integer from the input (unchanged).
- `m` remains `n` (unchanged).
- `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2.

### Calculation of `num`:
- Let's denote the number of times `c` equals `r` as `x`.
- Then, the number of times `c` does not equal `r` is `k - x`.
- `num` will be `x * 1 + (k - x) * 2 = k + x`.

Since `x` can vary from 0 to `k`, the exact value of `num` depends on how many times `c` equals `r` during the `k` iterations. However, we know that `num` will be in the range `[k, 2k]`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state, considering the general pattern and the fact that `num` accumulates based on the comparisons, is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `m` is `n`; `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` remains decremented by 1, `n` and `k` remain the same, `m` remains equal to `n`, and `num` is the total accumulated value based on the comparisons made during the loop iterations.
