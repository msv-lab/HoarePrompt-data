To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, let's first understand the context:

- `dp` is a list initialized with zeros except for `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.
- `i` starts at 4.
- The formula to update `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

Given these details, we can calculate the new value of `dp[4]` using the formula:

1. `dp[4] = (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
2. Since `dp[3]` was initially 0, `dp[4] = (0 + 3 * 3 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
3. Simplifying, `dp[4] = (0 + 18) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
4. Thus, `dp[4] = 18`

The rest of the variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations and `num` must be less than or equal to `n - 3`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be greater than 2, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[4]` which is 18, `i` is 4**.
