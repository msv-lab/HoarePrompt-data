You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid size `n` and a number of moves `k`. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the positions of the moves within the grid and prints the result for that test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a game on an `n x n` chessboard where players take turns placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other. The player starts by placing white rooks, and the computer responds by placing black rooks in a mirrored position `(c, r)` if the player places a rook at `(r, c)`. If `r == c`, the computer skips its turn.

Given `k` initial moves by the player, the task is to determine how many different final configurations are possible when the game continues until no more valid moves remain. Each configuration is unique based on the positions and colors of the rooks.

### Key Points

1. **Mirroring Moves**: When the player places a rook at `(r, c)`, the computer places a rook at `(c, r)` unless `r == c`.
2. **Self-Placing Rooks**: If `r == c`, the computer cannot mirror the move and skips its turn.
3. **Final Configurations**: The goal is to count the number of unique configurations after all possible moves have been made.
4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations based on the remaining empty rows and columns.

### Program Explanation

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
2. **Counting Self-Placing Rooks (`num`)**: For each of the `k` moves, it checks if `r == c`. If true, it increments `num` by 1 (indicating a self-placing rook). Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2 (indicating a pair of mirrored rooks).
3. **Remaining Slots (`m`)**: It calculates `m = n - num`, which represents the number of rows (or columns) that still need to be filled.
4. **Base Cases**:
   - If `m == 0`, there are no remaining slots, so the number of configurations is `0`.
   - If `m == 1`, there is only one slot left, so the number of configurations is `1`.
5. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: It initializes a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to fill `i` remaining slots.
   - `dp[1] = 1`: One way to fill one slot.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: Three ways to fill two slots (two self-placing rooks or two mirrored pairs).
6. **DP Transition**: For `i >= 3`, it calculates `dp[i]` using the formula:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7)
   \]
   This formula considers placing a self-placing rook in one of the `i` slots and then filling the remaining `i-1` slots, or placing a mirrored pair in two of the `i` slots and then filling the remaining `i-2` slots.
7. **Output**: For each test case, it prints the value of `dp[m]`.

### Correctness Verification

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of unique configurations based on the remaining slots after accounting for the initial moves. The dynamic programming approach ensures that all possible configurations are considered, and the modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion

The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided example. Therefore:

**Correctness: True**
