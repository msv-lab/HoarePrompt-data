### Reasoning:

The given problem involves calculating the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves by two players, where each player places rooks on the board under specific constraints. The key points to consider are:

1. **Initial Moves**: The first `k` moves are provided, and the computer mirrors these moves unless the move is on the diagonal (`r == c`), in which case the computer skips its turn.
2. **Remaining Moves**: After the initial `k` moves, the remaining moves are calculated as `m = n - num`, where `num` is the count of positions occupied by rooks after the initial `k` moves.
3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks without them attacking each other. The formula used in the DP array `dp[i]` seems to correctly account for the placement of rooks in non-attacking positions.

Let's break down the logic:

- **Initialization**: The base cases for the DP array are set as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
- **DP Transition**: For `i >= 3`, the transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used. This formula considers the placement of rooks in a way that respects the non-attacking constraint.

The program iterates through each test case, calculates the number of remaining positions `m`, and then uses the DP array to compute the number of valid configurations for those positions.

### Verification:

The provided example matches the expected output, which suggests that the logic implemented in the program is correct. The transitions in the DP array seem to correctly reflect the combinatorial possibilities of placing rooks in non-attacking positions.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and the matching example output, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
