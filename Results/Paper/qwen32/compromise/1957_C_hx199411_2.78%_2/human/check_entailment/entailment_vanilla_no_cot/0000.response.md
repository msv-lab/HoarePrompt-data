Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of different final configurations for each test case. The logic for computing the number of configurations using dynamic programming is flawed. Specifically, the transition formula used in the DP array `dp` is incorrect.

The current implementation uses the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` which does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. Instead, the correct approach involves considering the placement of rooks in a way that respects the constraints of the problem (no two rooks attacking each other).

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. Track the rows and columns that have been occupied by rooks.
2. Calculate the number of available positions for placing rooks.
3. Use combinatorial mathematics to count the number of ways to place the remaining rooks without them attacking each other.

The provided code does not implement this correctly and thus does not yield the right results for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is False.
