### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is correct.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Ships**: Numbered from 1 to n, each with a given durability.
- **Kraken Attacks**: Alternates between the first and last ship. Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1. The ship sinks if its durability reaches 0 and is no longer considered in subsequent attacks.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of ships that can be sunk based on the total number of attacks `k` and the cumulative durability of the ships from both ends.

Here is the annotated code with more detailed reasoning:

```python
from collections import deque
import math

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if k >= sum(nums):
        return n  # If the total attacks exceed the total durability, all ships will sink.
    (a, b) = (math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2)  # Split the attacks into two halves.
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]  # Sum of durability from the start.
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]  # Sum of durability from the end.
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1  # Increment count if cumulative durability from start is less than or equal to half of attacks.
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1  # Increment count if cumulative durability from end is less than or equal to half of attacks.
    return ans
```

#### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Incorrect Attack Simulation**: The code does not simulate the alternating attack pattern correctly. It sums the durability from both ends and checks if the cumulative sum is less than or equal to half of the attacks. This does not reflect the actual attack pattern where the Kraken alternately attacks the first and last ship.
2. **Double Counting**: The code increments `ans` for both `s_a` and `s_b` without considering that a ship can only be sunk once. This leads to incorrect results.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's take the example from the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
1
5 7
3 2 1 4 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
1. Attack the first ship (3 -> 2)
2. Attack the last ship (2 -> 1)
3. Attack the first ship (2 -> 1)
4. Attack the last ship (1 -> 0) -> Ship 5 sinks
5. Attack the first ship (1 -> 0) -> Ship 1 sinks
6. Attack the last ship (4 -> 3)
7. Attack the first ship (1 -> 0) -> Ship 2 sinks

So, the ships that sink are 1, 2, and 5, which totals 3 ships.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The provided code will not produce the correct output because it does not simulate the alternating attack pattern correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern and does not produce the expected results.

**Final: False**
