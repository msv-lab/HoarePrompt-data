To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration and how it affects the variables involved.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads an integer `n`, which is the length of the string `s`.
2. It reads a string `s` of length `n`.
3. It counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s` and stores it in `m`.
4. It removes all occurrences of 'map' from the string `s`.
5. It counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string `s` and stores it in `p`.
6. It prints the sum of `m` and `p`.

After each iteration, the variables `n`, `s`, `m`, and `p` are reset for the next test case, but the input values for each test case are different. The only lasting effect of each iteration is the printed output.

Since the loop prints the result for each test case and there are no variables outside the loop that retain their values between iterations, the output state can be described as a series of printed results, one for each test case.

Output State: **A series of integers, each representing the sum of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the corresponding input string for each of the `t` test cases.**
