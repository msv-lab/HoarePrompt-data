Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts at the minimum cost. The options are:
1. Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts for `b` burles (promotion price).

The goal is to determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion).

The logic in the program is as follows:
1. If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
2. If `n` is even, then it is always cheaper or equal to buy yogurts in pairs at the promotion price. Therefore, the total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
3. If `n` is odd, then Maxim can buy `(n - 1)` yogurts in pairs and the last yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Steps of the Program
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It checks if `2 * a < b` to determine if it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually.
- If `n` is even, it calculates the cost as `(n / 2) * b`.
- If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost as `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided example.

**Test Case 1:**
- `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
- Since `2 * a = 10 > b`, Maxim buys 2 yogurts at the promotion price: cost = `9`.

**Test Case 2:**
- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
- Since `2 * a = 10 > b`, Maxim buys 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 yogurt individually: cost = `9 + 5 = 14`.

**Test Case 3:**
- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Since `2 * a = 10 < b`, Maxim buys all yogurts individually: cost = `3 * 5 = 15`.

**Test Case 4:**
- `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Since `2 * a = 10 < b`, Maxim buys all yogurts individually: cost = `4 * 5 = 20`.

The program correctly computes the minimum cost for all test cases.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts considering the promotion price.

Correctness: **True**
