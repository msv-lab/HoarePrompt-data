### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided program to ensure its correctness, using the annotated version to validate the logic.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- **Options**:
  - Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
  - Buy two yogurts for `b` burles (promotion price).

#### Program Logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases, each with three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion).
2. **Decision Making**:
   - **Condition 1**: If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Total cost: `n * a`.
   - **Condition 2**: If `n` is even, it is always cheaper or equal to buy yogurts in pairs at the promotion price. Total cost: `(n / 2) * b`.
   - **Condition 3**: If `n` is odd, Maxim can buy `(n - 1)` yogurts in pairs and the last yogurt individually. Total cost: `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

#### Verification Using the Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases.

**Test Case 1:**
- `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
- Since `2 * a = 10 > b`, Maxim buys 2 yogurts at the promotion price: cost = `9`.
- **Program Output**: `9` (Correct)

**Test Case 2:**
- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
- Since `2 * a = 10 > b`, Maxim buys 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 yogurt individually: cost = `9 + 5 = 14`.
- **Program Output**: `14` (Correct)

**Test Case 3:**
- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Since `2 * a = 10 < b`, Maxim buys all yogurts individually: cost = `3 * 5 = 15`.
- **Program Output**: `15` (Correct)

**Test Case 4:**
- `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Since `2 * a = 10 < b`, Maxim buys all yogurts individually: cost = `4 * 5 = 20`.
- **Program Output**: `20` (Incorrect, should be `2 * 11 = 22`)

#### Analysis of the Fourth Test Case:
- **Program Logic**: The program checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it buys all yogurts individually. For this test case, `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, so it buys all yogurts individually, resulting in a cost of `4 * 5 = 20`.
- **Correct Logic**: Since `2 * a < b` is false (`10 > 11` is false), the program should consider the promotion price. For `n = 4`, it can buy two pairs of yogurts at the promotion price, resulting in a cost of `2 * 11 = 22`.

#### Conclusion:
The program logic is incorrect for the case where `2 * a >= b` and `n` is even. The program should always consider the promotion price when `2 * a >= b` for even `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where `2 * a >= b` and `n` is even, leading to incorrect minimum cost calculations in such scenarios.
