To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case. The loop reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. Depending on the values of `B` and `C`, and the parity of `A`, it prints a specific value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Condition 1**: If `B * 2 < C`, the output is `A * B`.
2. **Condition 2**: If `A % 2 == 0` (i.e., `A` is even), the output is `int(A * C / 2)`.
3. **Condition 3**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the output is `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2`.

After the loop has processed all `t` test cases, the variables `A`, `B`, `C`, and `i` will no longer hold their values from the last iteration. The variable `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop finishes since it increments from 0 to `t-1`.

The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` from the initial state are not modified by the loop and thus remain unchanged.

**Output State**: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and the final state of the variables will be:
- `t` remains the same as the initial number of test cases.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not used within the loop.
- `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop completes.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` will no longer hold any meaningful values as they are reassigned in each iteration of the loop.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. The loop variable i will be equal to t after the loop completes. A, B, and C will not hold specific values as they are re-assigned in each iteration.**
