The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The current state has `i` set to `n-1`, which means that if `n` is 0, the loop will not execute because the range function will be `range(0)`, which is empty. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` should be set to 0 (the starting point of the loop).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**
