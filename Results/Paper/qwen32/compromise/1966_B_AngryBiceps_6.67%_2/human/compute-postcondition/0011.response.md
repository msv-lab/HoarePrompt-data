The impact of the code `first_row += a[-1][0]` is that it concatenates the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the current value of `first_row`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `last_row`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new value of `first_row` will be the original `first_row` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a`, `i` is 1.**
