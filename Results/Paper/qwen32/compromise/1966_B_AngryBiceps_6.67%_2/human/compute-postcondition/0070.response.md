The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to `last_row`. Since `last_row` was initially the concatenation of the last character of the first string in `a` and the last character of the last string in `a`, appending the last character of the last string in `a` again results in `last_row` being the concatenation of the last character of the first string in `a`, the last character of the last string in `a`, and the last character of the last string in `a` again.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a` and then concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a` again, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a` and the last character of the last string in `a` again, `i` is 2**.
