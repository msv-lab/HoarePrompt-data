Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a list containing `n` input strings.
- `first_row` is a string of length `n` consisting of the first characters of each string in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string of length `n` consisting of the last characters of each string in `a`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- Additional conditions are provided:
  - Either the length of the set of characters in the first string `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or the first string `a[0]` is equal to the last string `a[-1]`.
  - Either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('YES')` simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides various conditions and descriptions of variables, but none of these affect the print statement directly. The print statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, or `i`. It will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of these variables.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
