The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the existing value of `first_row`. 

Given:
- `first_row` is initially the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`.
- `a` is a list containing three input strings.

After executing the code, `first_row` will now include an additional character, which is the first character of the last string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a` and then concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a` again, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is 2**.
