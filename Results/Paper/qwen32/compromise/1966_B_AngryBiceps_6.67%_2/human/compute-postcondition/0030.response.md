The code snippet `first_row = ''` sets the value of `first_row` to an empty string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `last_row`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is a string containing the last characters of each of the `n` strings in the original `a` concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`.**
