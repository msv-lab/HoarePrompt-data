Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings. The first string in `a` consists of identical characters, and the first string is not equal to the last string in `a`. `first_row` is a string of length `n` consisting of the first characters of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string of length `n` consisting of the last characters of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`.**
