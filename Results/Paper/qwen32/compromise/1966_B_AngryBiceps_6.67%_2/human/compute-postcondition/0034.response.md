The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the `first_row` string.

Given that `a` is a list containing one element (the input string), `a[-1]` refers to this single element, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of that string.

Since `first_row` was initially an empty string, after executing the code, `first_row` will contain the first character of the string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one element (the input string), `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n-1`.**
