Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of each string in `a`, `last_row` is the concatenation of the last characters of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`. Either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.**
