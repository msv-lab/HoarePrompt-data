### Reasoning

Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them with that color.

#### Program Analysis
The provided program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself. It then checks:
1. If the first row is uniform (all characters are the same) and different from the last row.
2. If the first column is uniform (all characters are the same) and different from the last column.

If either of these conditions is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

#### Function Summary Recap
The function summary confirms that the program checks the uniformity of the first and last rows and the first and last columns, and makes a decision based on these checks.

#### Original Assessment Recap
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect, providing a counterexample where the program outputs "YES" but the correct answer should be "NO". The counterexample is a 3x3 grid that cannot be made uniform using the described operation.

#### Evaluation
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly determine if the entire grid can be made the same color. It only checks the first and last rows and columns, which is insufficient. There are cases where the first and last rows and columns are not uniform, but the grid still cannot be made uniform.

For example, consider the provided counterexample:
```
1
3 3
BWB
WBB
BWB
```
In this grid, neither the first and last rows nor the first and last columns are uniform. However, the grid cannot be made uniform using the described operation. The program would output "YES" for this input, which is incorrect.

Thus, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
