You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it determines if the grid meets a specific condition: it prints 'NO' if the first row is uniform (all characters are the same) and different from the last row, or if the first column is uniform and different from the last column. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem asks if it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using specific operations. The operations allow us to select any two squares of the same color and then color all squares in the subrectangle defined by those two squares to that color.

### Key Observations
- If the grid can be made entirely one color, then the grid must be such that it's possible to "spread" one color to cover the entire grid.
- The operations allow us to "fill" a rectangle with the same color. This means we need to check if there's a way to connect all the same-colored squares in such a way that the entire grid can be filled with that color.
- A simple observation is that if the first row and the last row have the same color and are consistent in their pattern, then the grid can likely be filled with that color. However, this is not a sufficient condition alone.
- Another important observation is that if there is a single color that appears in every row and every column, then the entire grid can be filled with that color.

### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by checking two conditions:
1. If the first row is uniform (all the same color) and the first row is not the same as the last row.
2. If the first column is uniform (all the same color) and the first column is not the same as the last column.

However, these conditions are not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be filled with one color. The code does not account for the possibility that a single color might appear in every row and column, which would allow the entire grid to be filled with that color.

### Counterexample
Consider the following grid:
```
2 2
BB
BB
```
The code would output "YES" because the first row and the last row are the same and uniform. This is correct.

However, consider another grid:
```
2 2
BW
WB
```
The code would output "NO" because the first row is not the same as the last row. This is incorrect because we can still fill the entire grid with one color by selecting appropriate pairs of squares.

### Conclusion
The code does not correctly handle all cases and therefore is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
