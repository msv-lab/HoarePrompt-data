Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the allowed operations. The logic in the program is insufficient to cover all cases. Here are a few reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Checking only the first and last rows/columns is not sufficient**: The program only checks if all characters in the first row or the last row are the same and compares the first and last rows, as well as the first and last columns. However, this does not account for other possible configurations where the entire grid can be made a single color through the allowed operations.

2. **Ignoring the interior of the grid**: The program does not consider the possibility of making the entire grid the same color by selecting subrectangles that span multiple rows and columns.

3. **Misinterpreting the problem constraints**: The program incorrectly assumes that if the first and last rows or columns are not uniform or different, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform, which is not necessarily true.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to check if there is a single color that appears in every row and every column. If there is such a color, it is possible to make the entire grid that color using the allowed operations. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if there is a single color that appears in every row and every column
        possible_colors = set(a[0])
        for row in a[1:]:
            possible_colors &= set(row)
        
        if not possible_colors:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This program checks for a common color in all rows and columns, which is the correct approach to solve the problem.
