The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned in the initial state but are not modified by the code snippet provided. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, inclusive, and `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input. The code snippet specifically affects the variable `a` by assigning it a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
