The code snippet `ul += 2` increments the value of `ul` by 2. The initial state does not provide any information about the value of `ul`, so we can only state that it has been increased by 2. The values of `n`, `i`, and `l[a[2] - 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `l[a[2] - 1]` is 0, `ul` is increased by 2.**
