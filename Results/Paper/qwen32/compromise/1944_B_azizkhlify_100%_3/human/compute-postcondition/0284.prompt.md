Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `l` has been modified based on the conditions described, `ul` is incremented by 2 each time `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `r` is unchanged from its initial state, `a`, `re`, and `ur` are unchanged, `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not equal to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `l[a[i] - 1]` either equals 1 or does not equal 1. If `re` equals `k`, the current value of `re` equals `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `re` does not equal `k` and the program continues as per the else part which is not specified but does not alter the given conditions on `i`, `n`, and `l[a[i] - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `l[a[i] - 1]` either equals 1 or does not equal 1. If `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without altering `re` or `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `l[a[i] - 1]` either equals 1 or does not equal 1, `res` has `a[i]` appended to it if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, and if `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
