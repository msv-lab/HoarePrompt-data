Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` represents how many times `j + 1` appears in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `2 * n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ul` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `l[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 2 and `ul` remains unchanged. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs to the control flow.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` was equal to 2, then that element is set to 0 and `ul` is increased by 2. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ul` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
