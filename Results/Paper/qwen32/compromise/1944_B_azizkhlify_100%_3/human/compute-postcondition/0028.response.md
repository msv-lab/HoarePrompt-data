The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only terminates the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. Therefore, the values of `n`, `l[a[i] - 1]`, and `ul` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ul` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `l[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 2 and `ul` remains unchanged; the current value of `ul` is equal to `k * 2`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
