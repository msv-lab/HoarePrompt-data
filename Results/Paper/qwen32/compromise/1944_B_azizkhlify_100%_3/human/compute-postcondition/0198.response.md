To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `res` is an empty list.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `ul` and `ur` are variables involved in a condition that breaks out of a loop or if statement if they are equal.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` influences the value of `ur`: if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is outputting the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end (`end=' '`).
- The value of `a[i]` depends on the list `a` and the current value of the index `i`.

### Determining Values:
- The initial state does not provide an explicit value for the list `a` or the current value of `i`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`.
- However, we can describe the output format precisely based on the information given.

### Output Description:
The `print` statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end. The exact value of `a[i]` cannot be determined from the given information, but it is the element at index `i` of the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
