Given the initial state, we know that `i` is the second element of the list `res`, and `res` must contain at least two elements. The other variables `re`, `ul`, `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `k` are mentioned to remain unchanged, but they are not used in the print statement, so we can ignore them for this task.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

Here, `i` is the second element of the list `res`. Since the exact elements of `res` are not provided, we can only describe `i` in terms of its position in the list.

Therefore, the output will be the second element of the list `res`, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter in the `print` statement).

Output: **i (where i is the second element of the list `res`)**
