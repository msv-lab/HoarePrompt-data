Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2 multiplied by 2, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for each `i` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2; `k` is `2 * k - ul`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to be `2 * k - ul`. The values of `i`, `ul`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
