Postcondition: **`i` is `n-1`, `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2 multiplied by 2, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for each `i` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2; `k` is `2 * k - ul`. If `k` is non-zero, `res` contains all elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, and `re` is the total count of such elements. If `re` equals `k`, the loop breaks, and `res` contains exactly `k` elements. If `k` is zero, the behavior is undefined as there is no else part.**
