The code snippet `ul += 2` increments the value of `ul` by 2. The initial state does not specify the value of `ul`, so we can only state that it has been increased by 2. The values of `n`, `i`, and `l[a[1] - 1]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l[a[1] - 1]` is 0, `ul` is increased by 2.**
