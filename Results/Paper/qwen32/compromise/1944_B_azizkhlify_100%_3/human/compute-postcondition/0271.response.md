Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- **Initial State:**
  - `i` is 1.
  - `n` is greater than 1.
  - `l[a[i] - 1]` either equals 1 or does not equal 1.
  - The conditions involving `re` and `k` do not affect the values of `i`, `n`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` for the print statement in question.

- **Print Statement:**
  - `print(a[i], end=' ')`

We need to determine the value of `a[i]` where `i` is 1.

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 1.
- `a[i]` refers to the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

However, the exact value of `a[1]` is not explicitly given in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[1]`.

**Output:** **a[1] (where a[1] is the element at index 1 of the list `a`)**
