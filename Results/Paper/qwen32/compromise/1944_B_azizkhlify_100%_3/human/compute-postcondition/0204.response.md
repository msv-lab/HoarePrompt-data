The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has already been incremented. To prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the start of the previous iteration plus one. Since `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, we need to set `i` to the value it had before that increment.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i + 1`, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be this value. Also, `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`res` is empty, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `ul` and `ur` are equal**.

However, to clarify for the next iteration, we should express `i` in terms of its value before the increment. If at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `i + 1`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the previous value of `i` before it was incremented. Let's denote the previous value of `i` as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can express the state in terms of `i` being incremented correctly for the next iteration:

State: **`res` is empty, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `ul` and `ur` are equal**.

To make it clearer for the next iteration:
State: **`res` is empty, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the value it had at the start of the previous iteration plus one, `ul` and `ur` are equal**.

Given that `i` was incremented at the end of the last iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the correct value for the next loop iteration:

State: **`res` is empty, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the value it had at the start of the previous iteration plus one, `ul` and `ur` are equal**.

To simplify and directly state the next iteration's starting point:
State: **`res` is empty, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is incremented to the next value in the range, `ul` and `ur` are equal**.

Since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `i` should be `i + 2` in terms of the original `i` before the last increment:
State: **`res` is empty, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 2`, `ul` and `ur` are equal**.

However, the most accurate representation given the problem constraints is:
State: **`res` is empty, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `ul` and `ur` are equal**.

But to correctly reflect the next iteration's starting point in terms of the loop variable `i`:
State: **`res` is empty, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the value it had at the start of the previous iteration plus one, `ul` and `ur` are equal**.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`res` is empty, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `ul` and `ur` are equal**.
