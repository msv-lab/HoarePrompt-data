To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the code:

Initial State: `n` is greater than `i + 1`
This tells us that `n` is a variable with a value that is greater than the value of `i + 1`. However, the specific values of `n` and `i` are not provided, and neither is the list or array `a`.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```
This code snippet prints the element at index `i` of the list or array `a`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

To determine the exact output, we need to know the value of `a[i]`. However, since the list `a` and the index `i` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a[i] (where a is a list or array and i is an index such that i < n - 1)**

This output indicates that the code will print the element at index `i` of the list or array `a`, with the condition that `i` is a valid index in `a` (i.e., `i < n - 1` based on the given precondition `n > i + 1`).
