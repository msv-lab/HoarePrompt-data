The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The variable `n` must remain the same as it determines the total number of iterations.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input list, `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, except if `l[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0. If `l[a[0] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0. `r` is updated such that `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` are incremented by 1, `re` is unchanged, `ul` is increased by 2 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was 2, otherwise `ul` is unchanged, `ur` is unchanged, `i` is 1**
