Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then `ul` is increased by 2 if the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged. If `ul` is not equal to `k * 2`, there is no change to `ul` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
