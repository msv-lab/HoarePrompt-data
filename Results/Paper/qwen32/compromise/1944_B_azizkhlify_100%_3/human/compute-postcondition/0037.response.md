The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it determines the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1**  
Given that `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be the next integer value. So if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 4** (assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration)

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, the most accurate state we can provide is that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
