The code snippet provided is simply a `break` statement, which means it will terminate the innermost loop or switch it is contained within. The variables `i`, `n`, `r`, `a`, and `ur` are mentioned in the initial state, but their values are not changed by the `break` statement. Therefore, the output state will reflect the same conditions as the initial state except that the loop will be terminated.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is `2`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `r[a[i] - 1]` is `0` and `ur` is increased by 2. The loop is terminated.**
