Postcondition: **`res` is empty, and `i` is `2 * n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking. If the loop breaks, `ul` and `ur` are equal. During the loop, `ur` is incremented by 2 for each occurrence of `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0 for each `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.**
