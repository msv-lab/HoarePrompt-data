The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is initially 2. After executing the code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0`, the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is updated to 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition `n` must be less than `2 * n` is still valid.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**
