The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1 after the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can only infer that it was incremented by 1. So, if at the end of the last iteration `i` was `x`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`. Given that `n` is greater than `x`, it must also be greater than `x + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`**
