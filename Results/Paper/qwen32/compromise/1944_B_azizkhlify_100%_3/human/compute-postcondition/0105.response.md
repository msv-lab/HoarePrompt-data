Postcondition: **All elements in `res` will have been printed. `i` will be the last element in `res`. `re` will be the count of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1. `res` will be empty or fully processed. `k` will be updated to `2 * k - ul`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ur` is incremented by 2 for each element in `res` where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.**
