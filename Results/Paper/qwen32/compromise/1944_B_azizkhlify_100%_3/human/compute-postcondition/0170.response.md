The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i + 1`. This means that `i` can be incremented by 1 and the loop can execute again, as long as `n` is still greater than the new value of `i`.

The states `re`, `res`, `a`, and `l` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted here.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
