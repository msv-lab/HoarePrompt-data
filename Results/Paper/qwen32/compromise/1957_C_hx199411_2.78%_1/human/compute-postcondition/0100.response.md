The code snippet provided increments the value of the variable `num` by 2. Given the initial state, the value of `num` was initially set to 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise it was set to 2. After executing the line `num += 2`, the new value of `num` will be 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise it will be 4.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `i`, `m`, and `dp`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer read from the second input, `r` is the second integer read from the second input, `i` is 2, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r` otherwise 4, `m` is `n - 1` if `c` equals `r` otherwise `n - 2`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` if `m` is greater than 1.**
