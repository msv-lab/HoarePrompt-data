Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (0 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is `k + 1` if `m == 1`, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`; `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0; if `m` equals 1, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula.**
