To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the variables evolve based on the given loop logic. The loop runs `k` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `c` and `r`. Depending on whether `c` equals `r`, it increments `num` by 1 or 2. After each iteration, `m` is recalculated as `n - num`, and the `dp` list is updated accordingly if `m` is greater than 1.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is 1
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input
   - `num` is 0
   - `m` is `n - num`
   - `dp` is initialized based on the value of `m`

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `k-1`:
     - Read `c` and `r`
     - If `c == r`, increment `num` by 1; otherwise, increment `num` by 2
     - Update `m` to `n - num`
     - Update `dp` if `m > 1` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`

After `k` iterations, the final values of `num` and `m` will be:
- `num` will be the sum of 1s and 2s based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations.
- `m` will be `n - num`.

The `dp` list will be updated based on the final value of `m`.

### Final Output State

Let's denote the total number of times `c == r` occurred as `count_equal`. Then, the total increment to `num` can be expressed as:
- `num = count_equal * 1 + (k - count_equal) * 2 = count_equal + 2k - 2count_equal = 2k - count_equal`

Thus, the final value of `m` is:
- `m = n - (2k - count_equal)`

The `dp` list will be updated based on the final value of `m`.

### Output State in Required Format

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - count_equal`, `m` is `n - (2k - count_equal)`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` if `m` is greater than 1.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains 1.
- `n` remains the first integer read from the input.
- `k` remains the second integer read from the input.
- `num` is calculated as `2k - count_equal`, where `count_equal` is the number of times `c` was equal to `r` during the iterations.
- `m` is calculated as `n - (2k - count_equal)`.
- The `dp` list is updated based on the final value of `m` using the provided formula.
