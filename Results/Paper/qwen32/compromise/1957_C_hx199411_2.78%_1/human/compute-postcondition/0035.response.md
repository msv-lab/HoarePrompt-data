To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(3, m + 1):`, which means the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`.

Given that `i` is currently 3 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs as long as `i` is in the range `[3, m]`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3.
3. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.
4. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, `num`, `m`, `dp`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (0 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is 4; `m` is at least 3; `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is 7.**
