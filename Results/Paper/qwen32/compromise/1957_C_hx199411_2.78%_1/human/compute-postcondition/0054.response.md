Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, `i` is `k + 1` if `m == 1`, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula, `c` is the first integer read from the second input pair, `r` is the second integer read from the second input pair, and `c` is equal to `r` if `num` is 1, otherwise `c` is not equal to `r`.**
