Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (0 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `num` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and the moves `r_i` and `c_i`) remain unchanged.
