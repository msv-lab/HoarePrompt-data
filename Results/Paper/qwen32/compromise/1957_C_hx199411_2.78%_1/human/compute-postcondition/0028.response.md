Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`: The first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5).
- `k`: The second integer read from the input (0 ≤ k ≤ n).
- For each of the next `k` lines, there are two integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n), representing the i-th move.
- `num`: Calculated as the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`.
- `i`: Set to `k + 1`.
- `m`: Set to `n - num`.
- It is explicitly stated that `m` equals 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement directly prints the integer `1`. The value of `1` is hardcoded in the print statement and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, `num`, `i`, `m`) described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(1)` statement is simply the integer `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
