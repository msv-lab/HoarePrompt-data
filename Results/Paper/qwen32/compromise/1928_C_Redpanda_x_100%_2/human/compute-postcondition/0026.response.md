Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)` with at least one more element, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`, a value equal to `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**

Natural language: The value `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded, where `prime_to_i` is the square of `prime`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
