The code snippet `yield factor` will return the value of `factor` and pause the function's execution, but in the context of this task, it simply means that the value of `factor` is returned. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 4, `factors` is {2: 3}, `nn` is 2, `i` is 3, `primes` is [2], and `factor` is 3; a value of 3 has been returned.**
