Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)` with at least one more element, `prime_to_i` is 1, and `factor` is the next element in the `rest` collection.**

In this output state, the value of `prime_to_i` has been changed to 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
