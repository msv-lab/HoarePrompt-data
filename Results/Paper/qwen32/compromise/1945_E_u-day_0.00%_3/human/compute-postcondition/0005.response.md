The code snippet assigns the values `0` and `n - 1` to the variables `low` and `high`, respectively. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The variable `pos` retains its initial value, which is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is `n_new`, `k` is `k_new`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `-1`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n - 1`.**
