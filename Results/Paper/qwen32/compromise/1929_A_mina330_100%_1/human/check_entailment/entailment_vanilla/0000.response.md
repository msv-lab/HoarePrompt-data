Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The beauty can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

To maximize this value, we need to arrange the array such that the largest element is at the end and the smallest element is at the beginning. Sorting the array in ascending order and then taking the difference between the last and the first element achieves this.

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows the correct logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the array.
   - It reads the array elements.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array.

The program correctly implements the logic to compute the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

### Conclusion

The program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
