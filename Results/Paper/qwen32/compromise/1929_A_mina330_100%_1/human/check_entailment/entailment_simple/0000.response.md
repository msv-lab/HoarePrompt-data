### Reasoning:
The program aims to calculate the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

To maximize this beauty, the strategy is to sort the array in ascending order. When the array is sorted, the difference between consecutive elements will be maximized, thus maximizing the overall beauty. Specifically, the beauty of the sorted array is simply the difference between the largest and smallest elements, as all intermediate differences will be positive and contribute to the total sum.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program execution:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the length of the array.
   - Read the elements of the array.
   - Sort the array in ascending order.
   - Calculate the beauty as the difference between the last (largest) and first (smallest) elements of the sorted array.
   - Print the calculated beauty.

This approach ensures that the beauty is maximized for each test case.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

**Correctness: True**
