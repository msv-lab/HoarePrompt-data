The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `ntest`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, in the problem. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. The other variables, `n` and `a`, are related to each test case and are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `ntest` is the integer read from the input.**
