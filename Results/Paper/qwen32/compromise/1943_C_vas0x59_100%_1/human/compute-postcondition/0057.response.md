The code snippet calculates `ci1` by subtracting 1 from `ci2`. Given that `ci2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, and the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci1` will be the integer value of `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` inclusive, where the last vertex in the list is `a` and `previous[a]` is `-1`; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is the integer value of `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`.**
