Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index, `n` is an input integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `u` and `v` are integers representing the vertices connected by an edge such that 0 <= u, v < n.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to an integer input by the user. The values of `u2vs`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
