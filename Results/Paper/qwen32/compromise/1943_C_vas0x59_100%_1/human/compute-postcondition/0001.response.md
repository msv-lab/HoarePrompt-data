Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists; `n` is an input integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `u` and `v` are integers representing the vertices connected by an edge such that 0 <= u, v < n.**

In simpler terms, `u2vs` is now a list containing `n` empty sublists, where each sublist is intended to hold integers representing vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index. The values of `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
