Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` where the first element `t` indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` distinct integers representing Cowdeforces ratings. The function returns different values based on certain conditions:
- Case_1: If a specific condition is met, it returns `n - 1`.
- Case_2: If a different condition is met, it returns `k - 1`.
- Case_3: If the first index in `ind` (a list of indices) greater than `k` is found, it returns that index minus one.
- Case_4: It returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
- Case_5: Given `ind` has at least two elements, it returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
- Case_6: It returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
- Case_7: It returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.**
