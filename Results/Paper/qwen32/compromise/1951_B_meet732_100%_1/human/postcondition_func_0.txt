The function `func_1` processes a list `a` that contains test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n` distinct integers representing Cowdeforces ratings. The function identifies the `k`-th element `x` in the list and finds the indices of the first two elements greater than `x`. Based on these indices, the function returns different values: `n - 1` if no elements greater than `x` are found, `k - 1` under specific conditions, or a calculated index based on the positions of the identified elements relative to `x`.
