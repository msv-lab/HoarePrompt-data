The code snippet assigns the value of the first element in the list `nums` to the variable `num`. Therefore, `num` is now equal to `nums[0]`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `N`, `s`, and `e`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer assigned the value of the first test case from the input; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`.**
