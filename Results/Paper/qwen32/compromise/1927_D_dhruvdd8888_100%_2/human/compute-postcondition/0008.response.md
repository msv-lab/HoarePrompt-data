To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is the `i` and the `N + 1` in `range(N + 1)`. The loop will execute if `N + 1` is greater than 0, meaning `N` must be at least -1. However, since `N` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, and it's implied that `N` is a non-negative integer (as it represents a count of elements), `N` should be at least 0.

The variables `t`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`, and `arr` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, we should ensure that the initial values of these variables are consistent with the problem's requirements.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer assigned the value of the first test case from the input (must be at least 0); `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with an additional element `-1` appended to it; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list**
