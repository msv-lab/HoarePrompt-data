Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, there are two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.readline`.**

Explanation: The code snippet only assigns the `input` variable to `sys.stdin.readline`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, or `r`. The preconditions remain the same, and only the `input` variable is updated to use `sys.stdin.readline` for reading input.
