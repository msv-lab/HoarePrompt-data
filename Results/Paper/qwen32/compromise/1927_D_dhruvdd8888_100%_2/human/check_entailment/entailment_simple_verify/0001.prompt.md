You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
For each test case, we have:
- An array `a` of `n` integers.
- `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`.
- For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`. If no such pair exists, we output `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the array `nums` itself, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program constructs a list `arr` which contains tuples representing contiguous segments of the array with the same value. Each tuple is of the form `(start, end, value)`, where `start` is the starting index of the segment, `end` is the ending index (exclusive), and `value` is the value of the elements in that segment.
   - It appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the last segment correctly.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the first segment that starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the segment found to determine if it can provide a valid pair of indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`.
   - The logic used to determine the indices is flawed:
     - If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if the previous segment can provide a valid pair. However, this logic does not correctly handle all cases.
     - If the segment ends before or at `r`, it checks if the next segment can provide a valid pair. This logic also does not correctly handle all cases.
     - The conditions for printing `-1 -1` are not correctly defined and might lead to incorrect outputs.

### Example Issues:
Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the issues:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  1 2 3
  1
  1 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 2
  ```
- Actual Output of the Program:
  ```
  1 2
  ```
  In this case, the program works correctly. However, let's consider another case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  1 1 1
  1
  1 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  -1 -1
  ```
- Actual Output of the Program:
  ```
  1 2
  ```
  Here, the program incorrectly outputs `1 2` instead of `-1 -1` because it does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the range are the same.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
