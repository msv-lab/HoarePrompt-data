Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) followed by two binary strings of length `n`, representing the top and bottom rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
        else:
            break
    print(counter)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a stripped input string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the final constructed string based on alternating characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is False, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: j is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the loop conditions, and the loop has not broken out.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: counter is len(a) + 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
