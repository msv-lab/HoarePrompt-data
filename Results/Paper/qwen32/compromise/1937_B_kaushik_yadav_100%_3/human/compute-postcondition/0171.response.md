Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the loop conditions, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is either 0 or 1, `work` is either True or False. If `work` was initially True and `i` is 0, then if `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is set to False. If `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, `ans` is set to the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `work` was initially True and `i` is 1, `work` remains True and `ans` is set to the first character of `a`. If `work` was initially False, `ans` is set to the first character of `b`, `i` is set to 1, and `work` is set to False.**
