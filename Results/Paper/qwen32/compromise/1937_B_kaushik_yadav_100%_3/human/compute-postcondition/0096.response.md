The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially an empty string, and `i` is 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `ans` will contain the first character of the string `b`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 0, `work` is False, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations.**
