The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the `i-th` character of the string `b` to the string `ans`. 

Let's consider the different conditions for `i` and how they affect the output:

1. If `i` is 0:
   - If `b[0] < a[1]`, then `ans` was initially set to the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b` and the second character of `a`. After executing `ans += b[i]`, `ans` becomes the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`, the second character of `a`, and again the first character of `b`.
   - If `b[0]` is not less than `a[1]`, then `ans` was initially set to the first character of `b` and the second character of `a`. After executing `ans += b[i]`, `ans` becomes the first character of `b`, the second character of `a`, and again the first character of `b`.

2. If `i` is 1:
   - `ans` was initially set to the first character of `a` and the second character of `a`. After executing `ans += b[i]`, `ans` becomes the first character of `a`, the second character of `a`, and the second character of `b`.

Given these conditions, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string. If `i` is 0 and `b[0] < a[1]`, then `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b` twice and the second character of `a`, `i` is 0, and `work` is False. If `i` is 0 and `b[0]` is not less than `a[1]`, then `ans` is the first character of `b` concatenated with the first character of `b` and the second character of `a`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False. If `i` is 1, then `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the second character of `a` and the second character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.**
