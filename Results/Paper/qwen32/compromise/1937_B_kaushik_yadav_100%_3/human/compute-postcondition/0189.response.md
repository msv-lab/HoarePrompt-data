Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the loop conditions, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `work` is either True or False, `ans` is `ans` plus the second-to-last character of `a`. If `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is also updated to include the second-to-last character of `b` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is `len(a) - 1`, no further changes are made to `ans`.**
