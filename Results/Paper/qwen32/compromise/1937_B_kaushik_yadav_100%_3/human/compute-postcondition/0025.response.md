Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string, `b` is the newly stripped input string. If `i` is 0 and `b[0] < a[1]`, then `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`, `i` is 0, and `work` is False. If `i` is 0 and `b[0]` is not less than `a[1]`, then `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False. If `i` is 1, then `ans` is the first character of `a`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.**
