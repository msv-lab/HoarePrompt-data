The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables `counter`, `a`, or `j`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`counter` is either 1, 2, or 3, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
