The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` can be either 0 or 1. If `i` was 0, it becomes 1. If `i` was 1, it remains 1 (but it's incremented, so it becomes 2). However, based on the initial state provided, `i` can only be 0 or 1, so `i` will be 1 if it was 0, and the condition where `i` is 1 will not change `i` further in the given context. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is 1, `ans` is as defined based on the initial conditions, `work` is False**.
