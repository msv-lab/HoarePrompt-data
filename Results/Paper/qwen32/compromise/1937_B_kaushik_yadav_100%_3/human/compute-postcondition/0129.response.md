Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, the character at position `j + 1` in `a` is '0', the character at position `j` in `b` is '1', the character at position `j + 1` in `a` is not equal to the character at position `j` in `b`, `counter` is 1.**

In this output state, the only change is the introduction of the variable `counter`, which has been assigned the value `1`. All other conditions and variable states remain as they were in the initial state.
