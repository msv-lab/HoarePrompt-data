The `break` statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables `a` and `j`. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the termination of the loop.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `len(a) - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
