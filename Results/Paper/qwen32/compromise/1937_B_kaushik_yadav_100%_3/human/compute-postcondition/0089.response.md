The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the string `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a non-empty string
- `b` is the newly stripped input string
- `ans` is the first character of `a`
- `i` is 0
- `work` is True
- `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early
- `counter` is the final value after all iterations
- `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`

After executing the code:
- `ans` will be updated to include the character `b[i]` at the end.

Since `i` is 0, `ans` will now be the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations.**
