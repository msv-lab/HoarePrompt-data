The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the string `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a non-empty string
- `b` is the newly stripped input string
- `i` must be less than `len(a)`
- `work` is `False`
- `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early
- `counter` is the final value after all iterations
- `ans` is the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `work` is `False` with `b[i] < a[i + 1]`; otherwise, `ans` is the first character of `b`.

After executing `ans += b[i]`, the value of `ans` will be the previous value of `ans` concatenated with the character `b[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` must be less than `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, `counter` is the final value after all iterations, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`.**
