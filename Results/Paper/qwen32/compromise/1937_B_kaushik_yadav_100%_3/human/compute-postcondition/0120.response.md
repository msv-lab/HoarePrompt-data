Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `work` is `False`, `i` is `len(a) - 1` or the loop breaks early, `counter` is the final value after all iterations. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `a[i]`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts and their respective conditions.
