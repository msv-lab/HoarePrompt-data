The code snippet provided takes an input string, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `b`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `b` and the unchanged values of `t` and `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly stripped input string.**
