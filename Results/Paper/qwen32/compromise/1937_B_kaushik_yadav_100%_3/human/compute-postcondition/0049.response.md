To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the construction of the `ans` variable based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `a` is the stripped input string.
- `b` is the newly stripped input string.
- `ans` is the final constructed string based on alternating characters from `a` and `b`.
- `i` is `len(a)`.
- `work` is False.

### Construction of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is constructed by alternating characters from the strings `a` and `b`. However, the provided initial state does not specify the exact process of constructing `ans` from `a` and `b`. Given that `ans` is described as being constructed from alternating characters, we can infer that `ans` will be a string that combines characters from `a` and `b` in an alternating fashion.

### Example Construction:
Let's assume `a` is "abc" and `b` is "12345". The construction of `ans` would look like this:
- Take the first character from `a`: 'a'
- Take the first character from `b`: '1'
- Take the second character from `a`: 'b'
- Take the second character from `b`: '2'
- Take the third character from `a`: 'c'
- Take the third character from `b`: '3'

So, `ans` would be "a1b2c3".

However, since the exact strings `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. We can only describe it based on the given information.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the final constructed string `ans` which is formed by alternating characters from the strings `a` and `b`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the string formed by alternating characters from `a` and `b`)**
