The code snippet `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `ans` will now hold the first character of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True**.
