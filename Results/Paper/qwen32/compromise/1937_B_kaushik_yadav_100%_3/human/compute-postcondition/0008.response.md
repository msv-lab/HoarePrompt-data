The code snippet provided only assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `work`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the new variable `work`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True**.
