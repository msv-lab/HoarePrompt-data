Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is either unchanged or `i + 1` (depending on the condition and must still be less than the length of `a`), `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations. `ans` is the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `work` is `False` with `b[i] < a[i + 1]`; otherwise, `ans` is the first character of `b` concatenated with `a[i]`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is the first character of `b` concatenated with `a[i]` and then concatenated with `b[i]`. If `work` is `False` and `i` is incremented, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`.**
