To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop, which is `i < len(a)`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of string `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a non-empty stripped input string with at least 2 characters
- `b` is the newly stripped input string
- `work` is False
- The value of `i` is not explicitly mentioned, but we need to ensure that `i < len(a)` for the loop to continue.

Since `a` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `len(a)` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. If `i` is currently equal to `len(a)` or greater, the loop will not execute again. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `i` is less than `len(a)`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can assume that `i` could be any value. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to set `i` to a value that is less than `len(a)`. The simplest and most conservative choice would be to set `i` to 0, which is less than `len(a)` for any string `a` with at least 2 characters.

Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `work` is False, `i` is 0**
