The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the expression `len(a) - 1`. To ensure the loop executes, the expression `len(a) - 1` must be at least 1, which means `len(a)` must be at least 2. The variable `j` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the list `a` has at least 2 elements.

State: **`counter` is 2, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements**
