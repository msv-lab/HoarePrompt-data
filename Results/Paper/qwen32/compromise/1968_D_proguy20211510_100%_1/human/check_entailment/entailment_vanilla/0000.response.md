Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Overview of the Problem:
The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who play a game on a permutation and an array. Both players start at different positions and can either stay or move to the position indicated by the permutation. The players' scores increase based on the values in the array at their current positions. The player with the highest score after `k` turns wins.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - The program correctly converts these inputs to integers where necessary.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the paths for both players by following the permutation until a cycle is detected.
   - It uses a visited array `vis` to detect cycles.
   - The paths are stored in `pathb` and `paths` for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each path, the program calculates the maximum possible score that can be achieved within `k` turns.
   - It does this by considering all possible stopping points within the cycle and calculating the score for each.
   - The score for each possible stopping point is calculated as the sum of the scores up to that point plus the score of the current position multiplied by the remaining turns.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program compares the maximum scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the cycle detection in the permutation, calculates the maximum possible score for each player within `k` turns, and correctly compares the scores to determine the winner.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the logic it implements.

Correctness: **True**
