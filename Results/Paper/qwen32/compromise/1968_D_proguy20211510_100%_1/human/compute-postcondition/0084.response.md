Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `paths` is a list with at least 2 elements, `preb` is the sum of `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` across all iterations, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `curr`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
