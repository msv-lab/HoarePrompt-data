For the given `while True` loop, the loop is designed to run indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement or some other condition that exits the loop. Since the loop head is `while True`, it does not depend on any specific variables or conditions for its continuation. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary to ensure that the next iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]` twice, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of because `vis[pb - 1]` is 1.**
