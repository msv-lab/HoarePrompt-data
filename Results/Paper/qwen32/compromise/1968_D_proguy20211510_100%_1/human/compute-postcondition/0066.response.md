The code snippet `preb += pathb[i]` modifies the value of `preb`. The new value of `preb` will be its previous value plus the value of `pathb[i]`. Given the initial state, `preb` was already defined as `preb + pathb[1]`. After the execution of the code, `preb` will be updated to `preb + pathb[1] + pathb[i]`.

The other variables (`pathb`, `i`, `curr`, `resb`) are not modified by this code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`pathb` contains at least two elements, `i` is 2, `preb` is `preb + pathb[1] + pathb[i]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
