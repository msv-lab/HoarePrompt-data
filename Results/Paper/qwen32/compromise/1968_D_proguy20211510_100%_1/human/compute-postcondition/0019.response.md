The code snippet `pb = p[pb - 1]` updates the value of `pb` by assigning it the value of the element at index `pb - 1` in the list `p`. This means that `pb` now holds the value of `p[pb - 1]`.

Let's break this down:
- Initially, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`.
- After executing `pb = p[pb - 1]`, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, and `vis`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(t \geq 1\); `n`, `k`, and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`; `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1]`; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1.**
