Output State: **`vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 1; `vis[ps - 1]` is currently 1, indicating a cycle detection; the loop breaks when `vis[pb - 1] == 1`; `pathb` will contain the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `pb` will be the value that causes the cycle detection; `paths` now includes `a[ps - 1]` at the end; `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` and the loop breaks.**

In simpler terms: The loop has broken due to the condition `vis[pb - 1] == 1` being met. The list `vis` remains unchanged with all zeros except for `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, indicating a cycle detection. The variable `paths` now includes `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` has been updated to `p[ps - 1]`. The variable `pb` will be the value that caused the cycle detection, and `pathb` will contain the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` until the cycle is detected.
