Given that the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop that gets triggered. In the provided scenario, the loop breaks only when a cycle is detected, i.e., when `vis[ps - 1]` is 1. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we must make sure that a cycle is **not** detected in the next iteration. Therefore, `vis[ps - 1]` should not be 1. 

Since the loop head does not directly involve `vis`, `pathb`, `pb`, `paths`, or `ps` in its condition (as it's a `while True` loop), we only need to ensure that `vis[ps - 1]` is 0 for the loop to continue.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 0. `pathb` contains the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` up to the current point, `pb` is the current value, `paths` includes `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.**
