The code `pathb.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the value `a[pb - 1]` to the list `pathb`. Given the initial state, `pathb` initially contains two elements, both of which are `a[pb - 1]`. After the execution of the code, `pathb` will have three elements, all of which are `a[pb - 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(t \geq 1\); `n`, `k`, and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`; `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1]`; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1. If `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
