Postcondition: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1, `preb`, `resb`, `ps`, `pb`, and `ress` remain unchanged, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `paths` is an empty list, `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, `pathb` is a list containing two elements, both `a[pb - 1]`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
