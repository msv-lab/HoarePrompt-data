The code snippet appends the element at index `pb - 1` from the list `a` to the list `pathb`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1.**
