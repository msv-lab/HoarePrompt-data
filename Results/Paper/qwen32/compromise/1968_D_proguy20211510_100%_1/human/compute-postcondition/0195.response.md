Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`. If `resb` was originally greater than `ress`, `resb` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `resb` is updated to the value of `ress`. `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer.**

Explanation: The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` have been converted from strings to integers. All other variables remain unchanged.
