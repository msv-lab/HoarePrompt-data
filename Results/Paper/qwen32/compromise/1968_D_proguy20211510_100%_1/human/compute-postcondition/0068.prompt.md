Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `pathb` contains the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` up to the point of cycle detection, `pb` is the value that causes the cycle detection, `paths` includes all elements from the start until the cycle is detected, `vis` has `vis[ps - 1]` set to 1 at the point of cycle detection, and `ps` is the value that caused the cycle detection; `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `pathb` contains at least one element, `i` is 0, `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * k`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0]`, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `pathb` contains at least one element, `i` is 1, `preb` is `preb + pathb[1]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `pathb` contains at least two elements, `i` is 2, `preb` is `preb + pathb[1] + pathb[i]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
