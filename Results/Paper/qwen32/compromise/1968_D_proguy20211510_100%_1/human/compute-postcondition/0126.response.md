The code snippet appends the value of `a[ps - 1]` to the `paths` list. Given the initial state, `paths` was an empty list, so after appending, it will contain one element, which is `a[ps - 1]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0] to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb`, `resb`, `ps`, `pb`, and `ress` remain unchanged, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `paths` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]`, `pathb` is a list containing all elements `a[pb - 1]` until a cycle is detected.**

In simpler terms, the `paths` list now contains one element, `a[ps - 1]`, and all other variables retain their initial values.
