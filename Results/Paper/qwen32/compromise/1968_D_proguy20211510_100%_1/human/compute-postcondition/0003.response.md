In the provided task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute if and only if `t` is at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, `alpha`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect whether the loop executes.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect this.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

Since the task specifies that `t` is already within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), no further adjustment is necessary to ensure the loop executes. However, to strictly adhere to the requirement of adjusting the state, we can specify that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(t \geq 1\)**
