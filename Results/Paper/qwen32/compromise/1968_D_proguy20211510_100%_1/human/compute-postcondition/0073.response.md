The value of `curr` is updated to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. The values of `i`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress`, and `pres` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing after the if statement without any changes to the mentioned variables.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `paths` is a list with at least 1 element, `preb` is sum(pathb), `resb` is max(curr for all iterations), `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress`, `pres` remain unchanged, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`**.
