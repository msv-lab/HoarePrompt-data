The initial state describes several variables (`resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, and `i_final`) and their relationships. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('Draw')`. This statement does not depend on the values of any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'Draw'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not require any calculation or description of the variables.

Output: **Draw**
