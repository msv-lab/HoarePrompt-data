The `break` statement will terminate the loop or the block of code it is in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `paths`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements of `pathb` up to the point where `k < i + 1`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `paths` must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
