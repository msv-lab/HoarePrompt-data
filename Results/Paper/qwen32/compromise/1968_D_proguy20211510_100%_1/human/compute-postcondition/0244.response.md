The code snippet `preb += pathb[i]` updates the value of `preb` by adding the value of `pathb[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Given:
- `vis[pb - 1]` is 0
- `vis[ps - 1]` is 1
- `resb` is 0
- `ress` is 0
- `preb` is 0
- `pres` is 0
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate
- `ps` is the initial `ps`
- `p` is a list of integers from the input
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `pathb` is a list containing at least one element from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle
- `paths` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `a[ps - 1]`
- If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of
- `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`

After executing `preb += pathb[i]`, the value of `preb` becomes `0 + pathb[i]`, which is simply `pathb[i]`.

Output State: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is the initial `ps`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing at least one element from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, `paths` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `a[ps - 1]`, If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`**
