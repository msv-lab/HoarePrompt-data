The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but exits the loop it is placed in. Therefore, the values of `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `pathb`, `curr`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`resb` is `max(resb, curr)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i] + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list with at least one element, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
