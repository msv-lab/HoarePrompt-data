Output State: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0] to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb`, `resb`, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `pb`, and `ress` remain unchanged, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `paths` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]`, `pathb` is a list containing all elements `a[pb - 1]` until a cycle is detected, and `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of all variables remain the same, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
