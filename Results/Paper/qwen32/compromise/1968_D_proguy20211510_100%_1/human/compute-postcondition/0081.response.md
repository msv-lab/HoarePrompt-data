The given Python code snippet updates the variable `ress` by comparing its current value with `curr` and assigning the maximum of the two to `ress`. The other variables (`i`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `pres`, `curr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `paths` is a list with at least 1 element, `preb` is the sum of `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` across all iterations, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `curr`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, and `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`**.

In simpler terms, the output state is: `i` remains 1, `paths` remains unchanged, `preb` remains the sum of `pathb`, `resb` remains the maximum value of `curr` across all iterations, `vis`, `ps`, and `pb` remain unchanged, `ress` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr`, `pres` remains `pres + paths[i]`, and `curr` remains `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.
