The code snippet `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates the value of `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr`. The values of `pathb`, `i`, `preb`, and `curr` remain unchanged unless `resb` was previously less than `curr`.

Output State: **`pathb` contains at least one element, `i` is 1, `preb` is `preb + pathb[1]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
