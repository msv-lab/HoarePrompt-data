Postcondition: **`resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list with at least one element. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, or `pathb`.**
