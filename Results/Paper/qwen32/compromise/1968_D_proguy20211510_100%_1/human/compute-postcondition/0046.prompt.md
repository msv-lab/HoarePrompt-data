Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 1; the loop breaks when `vis[pb - 1] == 1`; `pathb` will contain the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `pb` will be the value that causes the cycle detection.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 1. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, a cycle is detected, the loop breaks, `pathb` contains the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` until the cycle is detected, `pb` is the value that causes the cycle detection, `paths` includes `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is not 1, no action is taken and the loop continues.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 0; `pathb` contains the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` up to the current point; `pb` is the current value; `paths` includes `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the state remains unchanged as described. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 0, the state remains unchanged as described.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 0; `pathb` contains the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` up to the current point; `pb` is the current value; `paths` includes `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
