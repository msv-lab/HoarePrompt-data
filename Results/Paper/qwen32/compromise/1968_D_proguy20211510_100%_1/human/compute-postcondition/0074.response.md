Output State: **`i` is 0, `paths` is a list with at least 1 element, `preb` is sum(pathb), `resb` is max(curr for all iterations), `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress`, `pres` remain unchanged, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`.**

In natural language, the value of `pres` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and the first element of the `paths` list. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
