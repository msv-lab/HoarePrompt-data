The code snippet provided is `suma += x`. This line adds the value of `x` to the variable `suma`. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Given:
- `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`
- `i` is 3, so `x` becomes `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3` which simplifies to `(a - 6) // 3`

Therefore, `suma` will be updated by adding the value of `x` to it.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `x` is `(a - 6) // 3`, `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its previous value.**
