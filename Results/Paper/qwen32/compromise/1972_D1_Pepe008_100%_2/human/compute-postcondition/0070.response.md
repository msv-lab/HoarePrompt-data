Postcondition: **`suma` is `(a - 12) // 16 + 2` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`. Otherwise, `suma` remains `(a - 12) // 16 + 1`. `t` is 3, `T` is greater than `t`, `info` is a list of strings based on the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1, `x` is `(a - 12) // 16 + 1`, `i` is 4.**
