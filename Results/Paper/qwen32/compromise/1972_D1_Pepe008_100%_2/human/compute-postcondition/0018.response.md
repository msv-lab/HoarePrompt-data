Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, no further changes are made.**
