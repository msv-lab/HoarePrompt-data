Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` remains unchanged, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - (i + 1) \cdot ((i + 1) - 1)}{(i + 1)^2}\right) + 1\), `suma` is increased by `x + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains as `i + 1`, and `b` remains unchanged. The value of `x` is recalculated using the formula \(\left(\frac{a - (i + 1) \cdot ((i + 1) - 1)}{(i + 1)^2}\right) + 1\). The value of `suma` is increased by `x + 1`.
