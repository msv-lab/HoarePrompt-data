To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `suma` is 16.
- `t` is incremented by 1 and is less than `T` (though `T` and its value are not relevant to the print statement).
- `info` is a list of strings.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(suma - 2)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `suma` is explicitly given as 16.
- The statement `print(suma - 2)` will subtract 2 from the value of `suma`.

### Calculation:
- `suma - 2` = 16 - 2 = 14

### Output:
The print statement will output the result of `suma - 2`, which is 14.

Output: **14**
