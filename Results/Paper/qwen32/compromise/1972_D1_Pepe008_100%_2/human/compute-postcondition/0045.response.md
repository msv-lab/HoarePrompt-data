The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is incremented by 1 and is less than `T`, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1, and `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The loop variable `i` has been incremented by 1 from the previous iteration.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `b` must be such that `i < b + 1`.

State: **`suma` is 0, `t` is incremented by 1 and is less than `T`, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `i` is incremented by 1**
