The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `b`, and the range itself. Given the loop `for i in range(1, b + 1):`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `T`, and `i` has been incremented by 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `b` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the loop.
- The other variables (`suma`, `info`, `a`, `x`, and `t`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`. Therefore, if `i` was 1 at the start of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration, and so on.

State: **`suma` is 0, `t` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `i` is `i + 1`**
