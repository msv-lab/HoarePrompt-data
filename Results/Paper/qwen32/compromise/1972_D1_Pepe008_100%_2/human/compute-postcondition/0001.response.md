The only variable in the loop head is `t` and the range it iterates over is `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be at least 1. The initial state of `t` (which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4) does not affect whether the loop can execute; it only matters for the loop body. Therefore, we need to adjust `T` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0**
