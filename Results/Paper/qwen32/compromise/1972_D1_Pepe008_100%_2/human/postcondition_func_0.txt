The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on these integers and outputs the result minus 2. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each integer in the range of 1 to 2,000,000, and the cumulative sum of all integers does not exceed 2,000,000.
