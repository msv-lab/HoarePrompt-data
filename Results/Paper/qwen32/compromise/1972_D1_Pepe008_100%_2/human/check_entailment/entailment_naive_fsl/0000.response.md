Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description:

The problem requires finding pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

The provided code attempts to solve this problem by iterating through possible values of `b` and calculating a value `x` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. It then adds `x` to the sum `suma` and checks if certain conditions are met to add an additional `1` to `suma`. Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. The code does not correctly handle the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent conditions do not accurately reflect this requirement.

2. The code subtracts `2` from `suma` before printing, which does not align with any logical step in the problem description and seems arbitrary.

Let's consider a simple test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- For `(a, b) = (1, 1)`: `1 + 1 = 2` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(1, 1) = 1`.
- For `(a, b) = (2, 1)`: `2 + 1 = 3` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(2, 1) = 1`.
- For `(a, b) = (2, 2)`: `2 + 2 = 4` is a multiple of `2 * gcd(2, 2) = 2`.

The provided code does not correctly count these pairs and will likely produce an incorrect result for this test case.

Therefore, the code is not correct for all potential cases, and the Correctness is **False**.
