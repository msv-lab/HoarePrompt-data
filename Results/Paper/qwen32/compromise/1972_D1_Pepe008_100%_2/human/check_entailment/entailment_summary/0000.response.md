Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over possible values of `b` and calculating the number of valid `a` values for each `b`. However, the logic used in the program does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem statement.

The problem statement requires counting pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The provided program uses a different formula to calculate the number of valid pairs, which does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program calculates `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and adds this to the sum, with additional conditions that do not correctly reflect the problem's logic.

To correctly solve the problem, one should iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds. This can be done using a nested loop structure, but due to the constraints, optimizations are necessary to ensure the solution runs efficiently.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, it is clear that the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.

Correctness: **False**
