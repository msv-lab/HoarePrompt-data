### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program, problem description, and annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Given Program Analysis:

The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as follows:
1. It initializes `suma` to 0.
2. It iterates over possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
3. For each `b`, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
4. If `x` is positive, it adds `x` to `suma`.
5. It then checks if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`. If both conditions are true, it adds 1 to `suma`.
6. Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

#### Annotations Recap:
The annotations describe the state of the program before and after the function call, indicating that the final value printed is `suma - 2`.

#### Original Assessment Recap:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because:
1. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent conditions do not correctly reflect the requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. The subtraction of 2 from `suma` before printing is arbitrary and does not align with the problem description.

### Detailed Evaluation:

Let's verify the program's correctness by analyzing the logic and comparing it with the problem requirements.

#### Checking the Formula:
The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not seem to directly relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The formula appears to be an arbitrary calculation and does not inherently ensure that the condition is met.

#### Checking the Conditions:
The conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are also not directly related to the problem requirement. The second condition `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is always false for \(i > 1\) because \(i * (i - 1)\) is not a multiple of \(i^2\) for \(i > 1\).

#### Checking the Subtraction of 2:
The subtraction of 2 from `suma` before printing is not justified by the problem description. There is no logical reason given in the code or annotations to support this step.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The formula and conditions used do not ensure that the pairs \((a, b)\) satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Additionally, the subtraction of 2 from `suma` is arbitrary and does not align with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
