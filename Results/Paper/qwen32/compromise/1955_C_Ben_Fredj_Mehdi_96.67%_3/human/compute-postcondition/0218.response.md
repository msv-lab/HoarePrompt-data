The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'200'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of the variables does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
   - `z` is set to the integer value 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input string split by spaces.
   - `n` and `k` are mentioned but are no longer relevant in their previous form.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('200')`.
   - This statement prints the string `'200'` directly, regardless of the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, or `k`.

Since the `print` statement is static and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output will simply be the string `'200'`.

Output: **200**
