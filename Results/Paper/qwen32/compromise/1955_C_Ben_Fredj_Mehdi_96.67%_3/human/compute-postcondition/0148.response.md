Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end, `d` is the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `g` has been set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
