Given the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and the code snippet:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `z` is initialized to 0.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
- `n` is explicitly set to 5.
- `k` is explicitly set to 2147483648.
- There are several conditions that `k` and `n` must not satisfy, but these conditions are not violated based on the given values of `n` and `k`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('2')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'2'`. The values of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` do not influence the output of this particular `print` statement because it is printing a fixed string.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **2**
