The code snippet updates the value of `k` by extracting the substring from `a` that starts right after the first space character and converting it to an integer. The values of `t`, `z`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is the string input by the user, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end.**
