To determine what will be printed by the `print(a.count(0))` statement, we need to understand the state of the list `a` as described in the initial state:

1. **List `a`**: The first `k // 2` and last `k // 2` non-zero elements of `a` are decremented by 1.
   - If `k` is even, the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements are decremented.
   - If `k` is odd, the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements are decremented, and the element at index `g` (which is the `k // 2 + 1`-th element) is also decremented by 1.

2. **Variables**:
   - `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `d`, and `g` remain unchanged.
   - `d` points to the last non-zero element.
   - `g` points to the first non-zero element.

The `print(a.count(0))` statement will count the number of zeros in the list `a`. 

Since the problem does not specify the initial values of `a`, `k`, `g`, or the number of zeros in the original list, we can only infer that some elements in `a` have been decremented and potentially become zero.

However, we can describe the output in terms of the changes made to `a`:

- If `k` is even, the first `k // 2` non-zero elements and the last `k // 2` non-zero elements are decremented. If any of these decremented elements become zero, they will be counted.
- If `k` is odd, the first `k // 2` non-zero elements, the last `k // 2` non-zero elements, and the element at index `g` are decremented. If any of these decremented elements become zero, they will be counted.

Without the exact initial values of `a`, we can't determine the exact number of zeros. However, we can describe the output as the count of zeros in the modified list `a`.

**Output: the number of zeros in the list `a` after decrementing the specified elements (where the number of zeros is determined by the initial values of `a`, `k`, and `g`)**

Since we can't compute the exact number of zeros without the initial values, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **the number of zeros in the list `a` after decrementing the specified elements (where the number of zeros is determined by the initial values of `a`, `k`, and `g`)**
