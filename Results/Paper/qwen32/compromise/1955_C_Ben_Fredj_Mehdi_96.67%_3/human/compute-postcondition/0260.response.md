Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. `z` is 2. `k` is an odd integer. `a` is a list where the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements have been decremented by 1. `g` is incremented by the number of times the element at index `g` became 0. `d` is decremented by the number of times the element at index `d` became 0.**

In natural language: The final output state has `t` as an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `z` is 2. `k` is an odd integer. The first `k // 2` and last `k // 2` elements of list `a` have been decremented by 1. The indices `g` and `d` are adjusted based on how many of these elements became 0 during the loop.
