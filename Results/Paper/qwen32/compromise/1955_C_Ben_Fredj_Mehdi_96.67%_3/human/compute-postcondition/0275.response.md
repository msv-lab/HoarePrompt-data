Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input string split by spaces. If `k` == 199999999999999, the state of `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` == 1000000000000, `k` == 200000000000, `k` == 2147483648 and `n` == 2, `k` == 1000000000 and `a` == [1000000000, 1000000000], `k` == 5 and `k` == 2147483648, `k` == 20 and `k` == 10000000000, `k` == 5999999999, `k` == 4294967295, `k` == 2 and `k` == `a[0] - 1` and `k` == `a[1] - 2`, or `k` is not equal to 3000000000 and `k` >= sum(a), the state of `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is not equal to 3000000000 and `k` < sum(a), the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements of `a` have been decremented by 1. If `k` is odd, the element at index `g` is further decremented by 1. `g` is incremented by the number of times the element at index `g` became 0. `d` is decremented by the number of times the element at index `d` became 0. If `k` is equal to 3000000000, the state of `a` remains unchanged.**
