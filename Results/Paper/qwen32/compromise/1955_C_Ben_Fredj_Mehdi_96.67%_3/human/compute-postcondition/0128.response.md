Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. `z` is 1.
3. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
4. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character.
5. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1')
```

### Analysis:
The provided `print` statement directly prints the string `'1'`. The variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are defined but not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this particular statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'1'`.

Output: **1**
