Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input string split by spaces. If `n` == 5 and `k` == 2147483648, the state of `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `n` == 20 and `k` == 10000000000, the state of `a` remains unchanged. If `k` == 5999999999 or `k` == 4294967295, the state of `a` remains unchanged. If `n` == 2 and `k` == `a[0] - 1` and `k` == `a[1] - 2`, the state of `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is not equal to 3000000000 and `k` >= sum(a), the state of `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is not equal to 3000000000 and `k` < sum(a), the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements of `a` have been decremented by 1. If `k` is odd, the element at index `g` is further decremented by 1. `g` is incremented by the number of times the element at index `g` became 0. `d` is decremented by the number of times the element at index `d` became 0. If `k` is equal to 3000000000, the state of `a` remains unchanged.**
