Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `z` is set to 1.
3. `a` is a list of integers obtained from a new input.
4. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character.
5. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('199999')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('199999')
```

The string `'199999'` is a literal string and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly defined by the code itself.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'199999'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **199999**
