Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The program checks if all elements in the array are the same and returns `-1` if they are, which is correct. However, it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful when the array is not already uniform.

2. The program attempts to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray that consists of the same elements and tries to use it to determine the minimum number of removals. This approach is flawed because removing a single element from such a subarray does not necessarily make the entire array non-beautiful. The program needs to consider the structure of the array and how the "beauty" condition can be violated by removing elements.

3. The program does not account for the fact that the "beauty" condition can be violated by removing elements in a way that breaks the pattern of `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` for some `i`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to analyze the array to find the longest contiguous subarray that can be made uniform by the given operation and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break this pattern. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.
