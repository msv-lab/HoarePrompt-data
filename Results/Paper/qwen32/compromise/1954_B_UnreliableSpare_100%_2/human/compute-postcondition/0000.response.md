The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This affects the value of `n`, but it does not change the values of `t` or the list `a`.

Given the initial state, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n.**
