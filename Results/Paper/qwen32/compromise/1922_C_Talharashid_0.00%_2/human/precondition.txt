t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in the list test_cases is a tuple containing three parts: (n, a, queries). n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. a is a list of n integers such that 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9. m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5. queries is a list of m tuples, where each tuple (x, y) contains two integers such that 1 <= x, y <= n and x != y. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city in a, the closest city is uniquely determined.
