The code snippet `s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` updates the value of `s2` to the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 2, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`**.

In natural language: The value of `s2` is updated to the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
