The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the values at the `end` and `start` indices in the dictionary `d2` and assigns it to the variable `s1`. No other variables are modified by this code.

Output State: **`start` is the first integer from the new input minus 2, `end` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` remains unchanged, `d2` has entries for each `start` position from `len(lst) - 1` to `1`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`.**
