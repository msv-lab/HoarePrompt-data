The code snippet assigns `lst` the value of a list of integers obtained from the input. This means the previous value of `lst` is overwritten by the new list of integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `start` and `end` are the values from the last iteration, `s` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `mini` is unchanged, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int value of 0, `m`, `t`, and `n` are unchanged, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
