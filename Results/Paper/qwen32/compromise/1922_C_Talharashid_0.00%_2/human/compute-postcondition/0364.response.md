The code snippet `s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` calculates the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `end` in the list `d1` and assigns it to the variable `s2`. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, `s`, and `s1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`**.
