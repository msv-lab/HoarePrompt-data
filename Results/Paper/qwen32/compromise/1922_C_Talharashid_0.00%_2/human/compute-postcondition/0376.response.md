Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 2, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
