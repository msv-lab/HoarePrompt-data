The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the values of `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. The values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, `s`, `mini`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The only variable that is updated is `s1`.

Output State: **`start` is the first integer from the new input minus 2, `end` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` remains unchanged, `d2` has entries for each `start` position from `len(lst) - 1` to `1`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`.**
