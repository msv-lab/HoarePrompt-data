The value of `end` is updated to be `len(lst) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference in the last iteration, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers from the input.**
