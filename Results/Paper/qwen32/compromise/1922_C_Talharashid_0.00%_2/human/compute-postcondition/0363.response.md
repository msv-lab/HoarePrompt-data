The code snippet `s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` updates the value of `s1` based on the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`. The values of `i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, and `s` remain unchanged. The conditions for `s1` and `s2` are no longer relevant since only `s1` is updated in this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`.**
