The value of `end` is decremented by 1. The values of `i`, `m`, and `start` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `m` must be a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, and `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1.**
