To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the loop condition `start != end`. According to the provided state, `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `end` is `0`. For the loop to execute, `start` must not be equal to `end`.

Given the current values of `start` and `end`, the loop condition `start != end` is already satisfied because `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `end` is `0`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `start` and `end` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `s` is `0`, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` and corresponding values of `s` (before this line was executed), `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `lst` is a list of integers from the input**
