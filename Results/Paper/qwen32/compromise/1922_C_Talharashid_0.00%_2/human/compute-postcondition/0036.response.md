The `while` loop condition is `start != end`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `start` and `end` such that `start` is not equal to `end`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_n` ≤ 10^9
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5
- For each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x_i`, `y_i` ≤ `n` and `x_i` ≠ `y_i`
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[start] = s`
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0
- `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have more than one element
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `inc` is 1
- `start` is either 1 or greater than 0 and `start` must be less than `end`
- If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`
- `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and also updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`
- `start` is now `start + inc`
- `d1[start]` is updated to `s`

The only variable in the loop head is `start`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `start` must be less than `end`. If at the end of the previous iteration `start` is equal to `end`, we need to adjust `start` to be less than `end`.

Therefore, we should ensure that `start` is adjusted to a value less than `end`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5; for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x_i`, `y_i` ≤ `n` and `x_i` ≠ `y_i`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[start] = s`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have more than one element; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` is 1; `start` is less than `end`; If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and also updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`; `start` is now `start + inc`; `d1[start]` is updated to `s`**
