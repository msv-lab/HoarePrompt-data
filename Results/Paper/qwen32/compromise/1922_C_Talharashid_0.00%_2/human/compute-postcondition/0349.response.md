To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
```

This line of code calculates the absolute difference between the elements of the list `d1` at indices `end` and `start`, and assigns this value to the variable `s1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1
- `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1
- `start` is less than `end`
- `s` is 0

The only variable that gets a new value is `s1`, which is calculated as `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`. The values of `i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `start` is less than `end`, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`**.
