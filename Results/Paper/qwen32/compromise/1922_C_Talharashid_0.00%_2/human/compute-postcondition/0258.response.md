The code snippet `start = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `start`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `start` is `0`, `end` is the value from the last iteration, `s` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `mini` is unchanged, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0`, `m`, `t`, and `n` are unchanged, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
