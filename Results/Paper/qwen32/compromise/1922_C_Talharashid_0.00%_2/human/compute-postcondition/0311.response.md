Postcondition: **`i` remains `m + 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is `0`; `inc` is `-1`; `d1` has keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values; `d2` remains a defaultdict with default int value of `0`; `mini` is `min(mini, abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]))` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains `11111111`; `s` is `0`; `lst` remains unchanged; `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, the variable `i` stays as `m + 1`, `start` remains `len(lst) - 1`, `end` remains `0`, and `inc` remains `-1`. The dictionary `d1` retains keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with their corresponding `s` values, while `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default integer value of `0`. The variable `mini` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` if `start - 1` is greater than `-1`; otherwise, `mini` remains `11111111`. The variable `s` remains `0`, and the list `lst` does not change. The variables `m`, `t`, and `n` also remain unchanged.
