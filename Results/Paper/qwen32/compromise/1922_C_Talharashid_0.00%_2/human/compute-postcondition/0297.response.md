The code snippet `start += inc` increments the value of `start` by `inc`. Given the initial state, `start` was `2` and `inc` is `1`. Therefore, `start` becomes `3`.

All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values of `mini`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` are still as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `start` is `3`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is `1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0` and `d1[start]` is either `s + 1` or `s + abs(lst[2] - lst[3])`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0`, `m`, `t`, and `n` are unchanged, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is `min(mini, abs(lst[2] - lst[1]))`. Otherwise, `mini` remains `11111111`. Specifically, if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `d1[start]` is `s + 1`. Otherwise, `d1[start]` is `s + abs(lst[2] - lst[3])`.**
