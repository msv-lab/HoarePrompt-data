The given code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` named `d1` with a default integer value of 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, or the queries `x_i` and `y_i`. The only change is the introduction of `d1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x_i`, `y_i` ≤ `n` and `x_i` ≠ `y_i`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0.**
