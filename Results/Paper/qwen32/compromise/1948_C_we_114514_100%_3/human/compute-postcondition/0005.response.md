To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n`: The integer value from the last iteration.
- `row1`: The string from the last iteration.
- `row2`: The string from the last iteration.
- `t`: Remains unchanged throughout the iterations.
- `results`: A list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` from each iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`results` List**: This list contains `t` elements. Each element is the result of calling the function `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration.
   - The exact values of these elements depend on what `func_1` returns given the inputs `n`, `row1`, and `row2` in each iteration.
   - Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `results`.

2. **`'\n'.join(results)`**: This expression joins all elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - If the `results` list contains `t` elements, the output will be a string with `t-1` newline characters separating the elements.

### Output:
Since the exact values of the elements in the `results` list are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the `results` list.

The `print` statement will output a string where each element of the `results` list is printed on a new line.

Output: **Each element of the `results` list printed on a new line (where `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` from each iteration)**
