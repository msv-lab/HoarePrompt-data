### Reasoning:

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a detailed analysis of each function and their roles in solving the problem:

#### `func_2`:
- **Role**: This function is responsible for reading the input, processing each test case, and printing the results.
- **Functionality**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two strings `row1` and `row2`.
  - It calls `func_1` with `n`, `row1`, and `row2` and stores the result.
  - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

#### `func_1`:
- **Role**: This function determines if the robot can move from position (1,1) to (2,n) based on the given grid configuration.
- **Functionality**:
  - It calculates `half_n` as `n // 2`.
  - It iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`), checking specific conditions involving the arrows in `row1` and `row2`:
    - If `row1[2 * i + 1]` is '<' and either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is '<', it returns 'No'.
  - It then checks if `row1[n - 1]` is '<' and `row2[n - 2]` is '<'. If so, it returns 'No'.
  - If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.

### Analysis of Correctness:
The correctness of the program hinges on whether `func_1` accurately determines if the robot can reach (2,n) under the given constraints.

- **Condition Analysis**:
  - The check `if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<')` ensures that the robot cannot get stuck in a loop or move out of bounds due to specific arrow configurations.
  - The check `if (row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<')` ensures that the robot cannot move out of bounds from the last column of the grid.

- **Logic**:
  - The logic in `func_1` is designed to capture scenarios where the robot cannot proceed to (2,n) due to the specified arrow configurations.
  - However, the logic might not cover all possible scenarios where the robot can or cannot reach (2,n). For example, it does not account for complex sequences of moves that might allow the robot to navigate around obstacles.

### Conclusion:
While the provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions, it does not guarantee that it covers all possible scenarios where the robot can or cannot reach (2,n). The logic in `func_1` is not comprehensive enough to handle all possible grid configurations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
