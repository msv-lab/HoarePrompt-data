Correctness: **False**

The provided program has an issue in how it updates the count of matching elements (`sm`) when sliding the window over the array `a`. The logic for incrementing and decrementing `sm` is incorrect. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the number of matching elements when an element enters or exits the window.

Here's a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        if ca[a[r - m]] == 0:
            del ca[a[r - m]]
        sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))
```

In this corrected version:
- The `Counter` for the current window (`ca`) is updated by adding the new element `a[r]` and subtracting the element that is sliding out of the window `a[r - m]`.
- If the count of an element in `ca` becomes zero, it is removed from the counter to ensure accurate intersection with `cb`.
- The number of matching elements (`sm`) is recalculated as the sum of the intersection of `ca` and `cb` after each update.

This ensures that the program correctly counts the number of good subsegments.
