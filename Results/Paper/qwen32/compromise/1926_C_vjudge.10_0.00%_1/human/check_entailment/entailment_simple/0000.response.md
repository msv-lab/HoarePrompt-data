### Reasoning:
The provided code is intended to solve the problem as described, but there are some issues with the implementation.

1. **Variable Initialization and Scope:**
   - The variable `soma` is initialized outside the loop that processes each test case. This means that the sum of digits from all test cases is accumulated in the same `soma` variable, which is incorrect. Each test case should have its own sum of digits.

2. **Looping through Test Cases:**
   - The outer loop `for _ in range(N):` correctly iterates over the number of test cases, but the inner loop `for i in range(n):` incorrectly starts from 0 instead of 1. The problem specifies that the integers from 1 to n should be processed, not from 0 to n-1.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer `n`.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix the issues, we need to:
- Initialize `soma` inside the loop for each test case.
- Correct the range in the inner loop to start from 1.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore,

Correctness: **False**
