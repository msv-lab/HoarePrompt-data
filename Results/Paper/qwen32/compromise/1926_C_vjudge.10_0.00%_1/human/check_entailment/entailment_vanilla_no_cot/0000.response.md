Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The variable `soma` is being used to accumulate the sum across all test cases, which is incorrect. Each test case should have its own sum, and the results should be printed separately for each test case.

2. The loop `for _ in range(N):` is iterating `N` times, but `N` is read from the input, which is actually the number of test cases (`t`), not the value of `n` for each test case.

3. The function `func_1` is correctly defined to compute the sum of the digits of a number.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Process each test case
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

This version correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case independently, computing the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` for each test case and printing the result for each test case.
