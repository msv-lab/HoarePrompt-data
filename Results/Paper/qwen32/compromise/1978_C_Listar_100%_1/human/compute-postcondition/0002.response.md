The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the return values of `func_4()`, but these values are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `n` and `k`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state mentions that `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`, and `k` is also assigned the value returned by `func_4()`. However, the value of `n` is explicitly mentioned to be 0, and `k` retains the value returned by `func_4()`.
2. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`, which directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`, the output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
