The code provided does not directly modify the values of `n`, `k`, or `l`. It calls `func_5(l)`, but the output or side effects of `func_5` are not specified, so we cannot determine any changes to the existing variables from this function call alone.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `func_5(l)` has been executed. Since there's no information about what `func_5` does, we cannot infer any changes to `n`, `k`, or `l`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`. `n` is not equal to 0; `l` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`. `func_5(l)` has been executed.**
