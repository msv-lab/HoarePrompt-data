Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`**, meaning `n` is now the first value returned by `func_4()` and `k` is now the second value returned by `func_4()`. The preconditions on the values of `n` and `k` are no longer directly applicable as they have been reassigned.
