The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and `k`, a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). It performs a series of operations involving a list of integers from 1 to `n` and the value `k`, which is initially halved. The function either returns a modified list or calls another function `func_2` or `func_3` based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. The final output is a list of integers.
