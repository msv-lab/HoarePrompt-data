Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 2 * min(`n`, `m`); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6. The sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^5.**

In this output state, `t` has been updated to the integer value provided by the user input, while all other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) retain their initial descriptions and constraints.
