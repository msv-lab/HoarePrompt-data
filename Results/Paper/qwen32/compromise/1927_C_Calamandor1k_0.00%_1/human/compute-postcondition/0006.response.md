The provided code initializes two variables, `count_a` and `count_b`, both set to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers input by the user; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the next line of input; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the next line of input; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0.**
