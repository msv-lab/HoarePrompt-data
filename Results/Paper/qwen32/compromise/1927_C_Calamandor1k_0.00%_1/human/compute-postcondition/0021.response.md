Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, or `b` is a list of integers with at least one element; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`; `d` is `k // 2`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is increased by 1.**
