### Reasoning:

The problem requires decoding a string that was encoded by replacing each character with its symmetric counterpart from a sorted list of unique characters. The provided program follows these steps correctly:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the first value as the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string (`b`).

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - For each encoded string `b`, the program defines a function `func_1` to decode it.
   - Inside `func_1`, it first creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It then constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - Using this mapping, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding mapped character.

3. **Output**:
   - The decoded string for each test case is stored in the `results` list, which is then printed out.

The function summary provided accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. It correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string, sorts them, and maps each character to its symmetric counterpart. The decoding process is then applied correctly to the encoded string to produce the original string `s`.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program handles multiple test cases efficiently and produces the expected output for each test case. The provided code and reasoning match the problem description and the function summary.

### Verification of Correctness:

- The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them to form `r`.
- It accurately maps each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
- It applies this mapping to the encoded string to produce the original string `s`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It handles multiple test cases efficiently and produces the expected output for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
