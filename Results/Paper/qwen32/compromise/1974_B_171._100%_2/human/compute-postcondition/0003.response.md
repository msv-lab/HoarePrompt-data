The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len_unique`. So, we can only adjust those to ensure the loop can execute.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `len_unique` is at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop index and will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Given the provided state, `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded`, and since `encoded` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `len_unique` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to ensure `len_unique` is greater than 0.

The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted because it will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `encoded` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary; `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded` and must be greater than 0; `i` is 0**
