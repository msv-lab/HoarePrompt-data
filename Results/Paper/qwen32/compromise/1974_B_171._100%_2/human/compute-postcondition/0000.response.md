The code snippet creates a set of unique characters from the string `encoded`, sorts these characters, and assigns the result to the variable `unique_chars`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `encoded` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `encoded` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.**
