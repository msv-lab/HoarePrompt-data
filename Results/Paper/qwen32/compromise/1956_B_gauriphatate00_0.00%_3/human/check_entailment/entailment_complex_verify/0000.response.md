### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a thorough analysis of the program and its correctness based on the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to confirm its accuracy:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves two players, you and Nene, who each receive `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards.
   - Each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - Players take turns placing cards on a table. You score a point if the card you place matches a card already on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the maximum number of points you can get.
   - **Logic**:
     - Use `Counter` to count occurrences of each integer in your hand.
     - Calculate `pairs` as the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
     - Return `min(pairs, n // 2)`.
   - **Reasoning**: 
     - `pairs` represents the potential points you can score if you have pairs of cards.
     - `n // 2` is the maximum number of turns you can make.
     - Since Nene plays optimally, she will try to minimize your points. Therefore, the maximum points you can score is the minimum of the pairs you have and the number of turns you can make.

3. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Read input, process each test case, and print results.
   - **Logic**:
     - Read the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, read `n` and the list `a` of integers.
     - Call `func_1` for each test case and store the result.
     - Print all results.
   - **Reasoning**: 
     - The function correctly handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads input efficiently and processes each test case independently.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - The original assessment verifies the program with the provided examples, demonstrating that the program produces the correct output for each test case.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound, and the program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

Based on this analysis, the original assessment accurately evaluates the program's correctness. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get under the given conditions and handles all test cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
