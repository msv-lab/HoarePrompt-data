Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer representing a node and the value is a list of integers representing the neighboring nodes, populated with the edges provided as input; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`; `leaves` is a deque.**

In this output state, the variable `leaves` has been initialized as an empty deque. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
