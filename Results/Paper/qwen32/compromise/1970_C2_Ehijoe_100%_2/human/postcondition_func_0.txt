The function `func_1` determines whether there is a cycle in a tree structure represented by the `nodes` dictionary starting from the `start` node, excluding the `parent` node. It returns `False` if the current node has only one neighbor which is the parent, indicating a leaf node or a single connection back to the parent. Otherwise, it recursively checks the neighbors and returns `True` if any of them form a cycle.
