nodes is a list of lists where each sublist contains the neighbors of a node in the tree, start is an integer representing the starting node of the game, and parent is an optional parameter used to keep track of the parent node during the DFS traversal (it should be None when the function is initially called). The tree is represented by 'nodes' and has 'n' nodes where 2 <= n <= 2*10^5. The 'start' node is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.
