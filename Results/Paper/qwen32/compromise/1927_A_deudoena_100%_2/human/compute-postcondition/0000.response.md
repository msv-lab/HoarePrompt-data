The code provided initializes two variables, `ma` and `mi`, both to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `s` as they are not modified by the given code snippet. The output state will reflect the initial state of `t`, `n`, and `s` with the newly initialized variables `ma` and `mi`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0.**
