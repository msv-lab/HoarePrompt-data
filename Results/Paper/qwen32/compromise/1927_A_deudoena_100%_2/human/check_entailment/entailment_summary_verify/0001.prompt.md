You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and returns the difference between the 0-based index of the first 'B' from the end of the string and the 0-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string, then adds 2 to this difference. It processes a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' present.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for all cells in the strip to become white. The key is to identify the first and last black cells in the strip, as the segment that needs to be painted white will span from the first black cell to the last black cell.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it calls `func_1()` which is supposed to compute the minimum length of the segment to be painted white.

Here is the breakdown of `func_1()`:
1. It initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0. These variables are intended to store the indices of the last and first black cells, respectively.
2. It reads the length of the strip `m` and the string `s` representing the strip.
3. It iterates through the string `s` to find the first black cell and stores its index in `mi`.
4. It iterates through the reversed string `s[::-1]` to find the last black cell and stores its index in `ma`.
5. It calculates the minimum length of the segment to be painted white as `ma - mi + 2` and returns it.

### Issues with the Provided Program:
1. **Index Calculation**: The program calculates the index of the first black cell correctly (`mi`). However, the calculation for the last black cell is incorrect. When iterating through the reversed string, the index `d` is incremented from 1 to `m`, but the index of the last black cell in the original string should be `len(s) - d`, which is correct in the provided code. However, the final calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect.
2. **Final Calculation**: The final calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1` because the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell includes both endpoints.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified above, the program does not correctly compute the minimum length of the segment to be painted white.

### Correctness: **False**

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = 0
    mi = -1
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    c = 0
    ma = -1
    for j in s[::-1]:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - c
            break
    return ma - mi + 1

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())
```

In this corrected version, the final calculation is `ma - mi + 1`, which correctly computes the length of the segment that needs to be painted white.
