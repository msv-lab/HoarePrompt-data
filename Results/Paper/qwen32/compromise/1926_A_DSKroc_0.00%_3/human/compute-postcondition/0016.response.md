The code snippet `ac += 1` increments the value of the variable `ac` by 1. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is the next character in `s`; `ac` is incremented by 1.**
