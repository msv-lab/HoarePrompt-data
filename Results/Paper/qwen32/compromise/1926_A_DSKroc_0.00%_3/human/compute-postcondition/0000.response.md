The code snippet provided only reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and it does not affect the distinct strings of length 5 that are mentioned in the initial state. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive, and that there are `t` distinct strings of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All `t` strings are distinct.**
