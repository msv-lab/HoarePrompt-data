The code snippet `ac += 1` increments the value of the variable `ac` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is the next character in the string `s`, but since `ac` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it has some initial value which we will refer to as `ac_initial`. After the increment, the new value of `ac` will be `ac_initial + 1`. The variable `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the next character in the string `s`; `ac` is `ac_initial + 1`.**
