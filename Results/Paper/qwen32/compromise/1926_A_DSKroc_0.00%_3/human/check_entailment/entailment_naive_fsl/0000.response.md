Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle each test case independently. The variables `ac` and `bc` are not reset to zero for each new test case, which means the counts from previous test cases will influence the results of subsequent test cases. This will lead to incorrect results for all but the first test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')

```

In the corrected version, the variables `ac` and `bc` are reset to zero at the beginning of each test case loop, ensuring that the counts are correct for each individual test case.
