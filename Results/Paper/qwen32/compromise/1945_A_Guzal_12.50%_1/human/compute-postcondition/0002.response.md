To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
   - Each test case consists of three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - `n` is the number of iterations the loop will perform, which is equal to `t` in this context.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` in the range of `n` (which is `t`), the following steps are executed:
     - Three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` are read from the input.
     - A variable `k` is initialized to 0.
     - The code then checks if `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0`. If this condition is true, it prints `-1`.
     - If the condition is false, it calculates `k` as `a + (b + c) // 3`.
     - If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it increments `k` by 1.
     - Finally, it prints the value of `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - For each iteration, the code prints either `-1` or the calculated value of `k`.
   - Since the loop runs `t` times, there will be `t` outputs, each corresponding to one test case.

The state of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` changes with each iteration, but the variable `n` remains constant and equal to `t`. The output state is determined by the `t` outputs generated by the loop.

**Output State**: **The output state consists of `t` lines, where each line is either `-1` or a calculated integer `k` based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not preserved after the loop, but `n` remains unchanged and equal to `t`.**

Given the format requirement, we simplify it to:

Output State: **t lines, each being either -1 or a calculated integer k based on the input values for each test case.**
