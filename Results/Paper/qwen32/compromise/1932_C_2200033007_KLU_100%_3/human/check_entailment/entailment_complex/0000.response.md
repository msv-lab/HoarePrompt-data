Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` modulo `m` before processing each command, and then remove the appropriate element ('L' for leftmost, 'R' for rightmost). However, the current implementation first rearranges the elements of `a` based on the commands in `s` and then calculates the cumulative product of these rearranged elements in reverse order.

The correct approach should be:
1. Initialize the product to 1.
2. For each command in `s`:
   - Calculate the product of the current elements in `a` modulo `m`.
   - Append this product to the result list.
   - Remove the leftmost or rightmost element based on the command.
3. Return the result list.

The current implementation does not correctly handle the product calculation before each removal. Instead, it rearranges the elements first and then calculates the product in reverse order, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
