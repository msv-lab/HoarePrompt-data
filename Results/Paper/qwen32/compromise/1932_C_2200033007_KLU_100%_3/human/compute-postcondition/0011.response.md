Functionality: **The function takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It rearranges the elements of `a` based on the instructions in `s`, computes the cumulative product modulo `m` of the rearranged list in reverse order, and returns the resulting list in reverse order.**
