Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have three players with scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` such that `p1 <= p2 <= p3`.
- The total points awarded in all games played is `p1 + p2 + p3`.
- Each game results in either 2 points (one player wins, the other loses) or 2 points (both players draw).
- The goal is to find the maximum number of draws possible, or determine if the given scores are inconsistent.

### Key Observations:
1. **Total Points Parity**: Since each game awards a total of 2 points, the sum `p1 + p2 + p3` must be even. If it's odd, the scores are inconsistent, and we should output `-1`.
2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The maximum number of draws is limited by two factors:
   - The total number of games played, which is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`.
   - The total points that the two players with the lowest scores could have earned through draws alone, which is `p1 + p2`.

### Program Analysis:
The program correctly implements these observations:
- It first checks if the total points `(a + b + c)` is even. If not, it prints `-1`.
- If the total points are even, it calculates the total number of games played as `(a + b + c) // 2`.
- It then calculates the maximum possible points from draws involving the two players with the lowest scores as `a + b`.
- The maximum number of draws is the minimum of these two values: `min((a + b + c) // 2, a + b)`.

### Verification with Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `min(0, 0) = 0`
   - Output: `0` (correct)

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `min(1, 1) = 1`
   - Output: `1` (correct)

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `min(2, 2) = 2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `min(6, 7) = 6`
   - Output: `6` (correct)

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `min(6, 2) = 2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify inconsistent scores. Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
