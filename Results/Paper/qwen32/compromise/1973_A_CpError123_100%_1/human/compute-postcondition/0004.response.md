Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted scores (in non-decreasing order) for three players. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is even. If the sum is odd, it outputs -1. If the sum is even, it calculates half of the total score and compares it with the sum of the first two scores, outputting the smaller of the two values.**
