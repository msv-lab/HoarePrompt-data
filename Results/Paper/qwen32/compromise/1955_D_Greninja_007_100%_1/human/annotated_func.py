#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Similarly, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `cb` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `a[:m]`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements common between `ca` and `cb` plus 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements common between `ca` and `cb`.

    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the number of times `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates the number of times a sliding window of size `m` over the list `a` has at least `k` common elements with the list `b`. It returns the count of such occurrences.
