The code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `arr` and assigns it to the variable `nums`. The `Counter` object will count the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`.

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`.

After executing the code:
- `nums` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of each integer in `arr`.

The precondition that `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr` remains valid. The only change is the introduction of the `nums` variable.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the counts of each integer in `arr`.**
