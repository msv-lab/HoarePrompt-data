In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the input provided during runtime, specifically by the value returned by `int(input())`. This means that before the loop starts executing, we need to ensure that the input value is such that the loop can run as expected.

The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. This means that the only variable we can adjust is the input value that will be converted to an integer and used in the `range()` function.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be at least 1.
3. The state of `t`, `n`, and `alphabet` does not affect the execution of the loop directly, as they are not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted such that the input value is at least 1. 

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'; the input value must be an integer greater than or equal to 1**. 

However, since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, the relevant part of the state to adjust is the input value:

State: **the input value must be an integer greater than or equal to 1**.
