You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: a sequence of words printed for each test case based on the value of `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` such that 3 <= n <= 78, and prints a specific word based on the value of `n`. The printed word is determined by a predefined pattern involving lowercase English letters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all possible values of `n` within the given range (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). Let's examine some edge cases and potential issues:

1. **Case for n = 3:**
   - The code correctly outputs "aaa" for `n = 3`, which is correct because the smallest possible word with a sum of positions equal to 3 is "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1).

2. **Case for n = 27:**
   - The code correctly outputs "aay" for `n = 27`, which is correct because the smallest possible word with a sum of positions equal to 27 is "aay" (1 + 1 + 25).

3. **Case for n = 52:**
   - The code does not handle `n = 52` correctly. The smallest possible word with a sum of positions equal to 52 is "azz" (1 + 26 + 25). However, the code does not account for this scenario and will output "aay" instead.

4. **Case for n = 78:**
   - The code correctly outputs "rzz" for `n = 78`, which is correct because the smallest possible word with a sum of positions equal to 78 is "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26).

5. **General Case for 28 ≤ n ≤ 52:**
   - The code outputs a word starting with "a" and ending with "z", which is not always correct. For example, for `n = 30`, the smallest possible word is "aba" (1 + 2 + 27), but the code will output "abz" (1 + 2 + 26).

To ensure the code is correct, it needs to properly handle all values of `n` within the range and construct the lexicographically smallest word accordingly. The current implementation does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly for values of `n` between 28 and 52.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n == 3:
            word = 'aaa'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        elif n == 52:
            word = 'azz'
        elif n == 78:
            word = 'rzz'
        else:
            a = min(26, n - 2)
            b = min(26, n - a - 1)
            c = n - a - b
            word = alphabet[a-1] + alphabet[b-1] + alphabet[c-1]
        print(word)
```

However, the above code still needs to be generalized to handle all values of `n` correctly. A more generalized approach would be:

```python
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n == 3:
            word = 'aaa'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        elif n == 52:
            word = 'azz'
        elif n == 78:
            word = 'rzz'
        else:
            a = 1
            b = 1
            c = n - 2
            while c > 26:
                b += 1
                c -= 25
            word = alphabet[a-1] + alphabet[b-1] + alphabet[c-1]
        print(word)
```

This corrected version ensures that the function handles all edge cases correctly.
