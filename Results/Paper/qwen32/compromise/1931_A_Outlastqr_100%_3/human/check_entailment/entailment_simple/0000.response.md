### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze the logic used to decode the encoded integer back into the lexicographically smallest three-letter word.

The program processes each test case by reading an integer `n` and constructing a three-letter word based on the value of `n`. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Alphabet Mapping**: The program uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to map each letter to its position in the alphabet (a -> 1, b -> 2, ..., z -> 26).

2. **Logic for Constructing the Word**:
   - If `n > 52`, the program constructs the word by taking the character at position `n - 53` in the alphabet and appending 'zz'. This is because the maximum possible sum for 'azz' is 52 (1 + 26 + 25), so any value greater than 52 implies the first letter must be beyond 'a'.
   - If `n > 27`, the program constructs the word as 'a' followed by the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet and 'z'. This handles cases where the sum is more than 27 (1 + 1 + 25), but not more than 52.
   - If `n == 27`, the program outputs 'aay'. This is because the sum 27 can only be achieved by 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25).
   - If `n <= 27`, the program constructs the word as 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet. This handles the smallest possible sums, where the word starts with 'aa'.

Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:

1. **24**: The smallest word that sums to 24 is 'aav' (1 + 1 + 22).
2. **70**: The smallest word that sums to 70 is 'rzz' (18 + 26 + 26).
3. **3**: The smallest word that sums to 3 is 'aaa' (1 + 1 + 1).
4. **55**: The smallest word that sums to 55 is 'czz' (3 + 26 + 26).
5. **48**: The smallest word that sums to 48 is 'auz' (1 + 21 + 26).

The program's logic correctly handles these cases and produces the lexicographically smallest words as expected.
