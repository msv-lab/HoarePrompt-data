In the provided task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, once for each test case. The variables in the loop head are `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and the result of `int(input())`, which is the number of iterations.

Given this, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The values of `p_i` (the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted according to the task constraints.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
