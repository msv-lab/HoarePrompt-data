To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the program's logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally from a sequence of integers where each integer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

#### Key Points:
- **XOR Properties**:
  - XOR of a number with itself is 0 (e.g., 1 XOR 1 = 0).
  - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (e.g., 1 XOR 0 = 1).
  - XOR is commutative and associative.
- **Winning Condition**: Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
- **Eve's Strategy**: Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins, so she needs to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers becomes zero as often as possible.

#### Strategy:
- If there are an odd number of 1s, 3s, and an even number of 2s and 4s, Bob can win at least once when all numbers are present.
- If there are an even number of 1s, 3s, and an even number of 2s and 4s, Bob can win more often by removing pairs of numbers that cancel each other out in terms of XOR.
- The number of times Bob can win is maximized by considering the parity (odd/even) of the counts of 1s and 3s, and the counts of 2s and 4s.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the given program logic:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

- **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
- **Processing**:
  - `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`: This line attempts to convert each count to an even number by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2. However, this operation does not make sense in the context of the problem because we need the exact counts of each number to determine the XOR parity.
  - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3`: This checks if the first three counts (1s, 2s, 3s) have an odd number of odd counts. If they do, it means there is an odd number of 1s and 3s, which could be a part of the strategy to determine if Bob can win once.
  - `sum(p) // 2`: This calculates half of the total count of numbers, which seems to be an attempt to determine the number of pairs that can be removed, but it does not correctly account for the XOR properties.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The operations performed on the counts do not align with the XOR properties and the strategy required to solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
