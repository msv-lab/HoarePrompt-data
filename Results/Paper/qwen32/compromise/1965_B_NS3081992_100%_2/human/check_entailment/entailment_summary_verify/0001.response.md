Let's analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary to determine if the given program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
The task is to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Program Analysis
The key function here is `func_14()`, which processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`, constructing the sequence, and returning the sequence length and the sequence itself.

#### Handling `k = 1`
- If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the program returns `[2]`. This is correct because the only possible sums are `0` and `2` (not `1`).
- For other values of `n` when `k == 1`, the program constructs a sequence `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ...]`. This ensures that every sum from `1` to `n` can be formed except `1` itself.

#### Handling `k != 1`
- The program constructs a sequence starting with powers of `2` up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
- It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that the sum of the sequence up to this point is `k-1` (excluding `k`).
- The program then adds `k+1` and `2*k+1` to the sequence. These values are chosen to avoid forming the sum `k` while still being able to form all sums up to `n`.
- Finally, it adds the remaining powers of `2` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Verification of Conditions
1. **No Subsequence with Sum `k`**:
   - The sequence construction avoids creating a subsequence that sums to `k`. For `k != 1`, the inclusion of `k+1` and `2*k+1` ensures that no combination of the sequence can sum to `k`.
   - For `k = 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ...]` ensures no subsequence sums to `1`.

2. **All Sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`)**:
   - The sequence constructed ensures that all sums from `1` to `n` can be formed except for `k`. The inclusion of powers of `2` and the specific values like `k-1 - sum(ans)`, `k+1`, and `2*k+1` helps achieve this.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly handle all test cases as per the problem description. The logic for constructing the sequence is sound and ensures that the conditions are met.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
