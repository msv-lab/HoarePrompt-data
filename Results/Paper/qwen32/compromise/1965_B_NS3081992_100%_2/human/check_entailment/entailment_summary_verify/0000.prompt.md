You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 15 : The function `func_15` generates and prints a sequence of outputs, each corresponding to the processing of a test case. The number of test cases is determined by another function `func_10`, and each test case is processed by `func_14`. The output for each test case is printed on a new line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when `k` is not equal to 1. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Handling `k == 1`**:
   - The code correctly handles the case when `k == 1`. It ensures that no subsequence sums to 1 by constructing a sequence that avoids 1 while still allowing all other sums up to `n`.

2. **Handling `k != 1`**:
   - The code constructs a sequence that includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n` and `k`. It also includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`.
   - However, the inclusion of `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` does not guarantee that no subsequence will sum to `k`. Specifically, the term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` can sometimes be negative or zero, which is not valid for a non-negative integer sequence.
   - Additionally, the sequence might not cover all sums up to `n` if the constructed values do not properly combine to form all possible sums.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a specific test case to illustrate the issue:
- Input: `n = 10`, `k = 7`
- Expected output: A sequence such that no subsequence sums to 7, but all other sums from 1 to 10 are possible.

The provided code might generate a sequence like:
- `ans = [1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 15]`
- This sequence might not cover all sums from 1 to 10, and it might include invalid values (e.g., negative numbers or zeros).

### Correct Approach:
A more robust approach would be to construct the sequence using a greedy method or dynamic programming to ensure that all sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) are possible while avoiding the sum `k`.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential issues with the current implementation, especially in handling the inclusion of `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`, the program does not meet the requirements for all cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
