To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all valid inputs.

The program reads multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, and for each test case, it outputs a sequence `a` of non-negative integers that satisfies the following conditions:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

Let's review the provided solution, specifically `func_14`, which seems to generate the sequence for each test case.

### Analysis of `func_14`:

1. **Case when `k == 1`:**
   - If `n == 2`, the sequence is `[2]`, which is correct because there's no subsequence that sums to `1` and a subsequence that sums to `2`.
   - Otherwise, the sequence is `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that all sums from `2` to `n` can be formed by selecting appropriate subsequences, and none of these sums can be `1`.

2. **Case when `k != 1`:**
   - The binary representation of `k` is used to determine the initial part of the sequence.
   - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
   - Then, it adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that the sum of the initial part of the sequence doesn't reach `k`.
   - It also includes `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that sums up to `n` can be formed, except for `k`.
   - Finally, it adds powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **No Subsequence Sums to `k`:** The strategy of avoiding `k` in the sequence construction ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`.
- **Subsequences for All `v != k`:** The inclusion of powers of 2 and the specific adjustments for `k` ensure that all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` can be formed by appropriate subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and generate valid sequences for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
