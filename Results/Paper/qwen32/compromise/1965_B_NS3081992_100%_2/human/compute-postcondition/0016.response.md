The code snippet `ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))` appends a new value to the list `ans`. The new value is calculated as `k - 1 - sum(ans)`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` is a list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(l-1)]`, where `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. The sum of the elements in `ans` before the append operation is the sum of the first `l` powers of 2, which is `2^l - 1`.

The new value to be appended is `k - 1 - (2^l - 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 2^l`. Therefore, the list `ans` will now include this new value.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, `ans` is a list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(l-1), k - 2^l]`.**
