The code snippet provided initializes a list `ans` with the values `[2, 3]`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, or `l`. 

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and `k` is 1; `n` is not equal to 2; `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `ans` is `[2, 3]`.**
