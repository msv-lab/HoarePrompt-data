The code snippet assigns the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) to the variable `bk`. Therefore, `bk` will now hold the binary string representation of `k`.

The other variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n; `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.**
