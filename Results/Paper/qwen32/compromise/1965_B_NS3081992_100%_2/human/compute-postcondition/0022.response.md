Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n; `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. If `k == 1`, the program does not modify any variables. Otherwise, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, and `ans` is a list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(l-1), k - 2^l, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1)]`.**

This postcondition describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, taking into account the conditions specified in the precondition.
