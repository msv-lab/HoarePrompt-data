The function `func_13` computes the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. It returns a tuple containing the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, along with the GCD itself. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0, a)`, indicating that the GCD is `a` and the coefficients are `1` and `0`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates and returns the coefficients and GCD based on the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
