The given code snippet is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `n` is an integer and `n` must be greater than 3.
- `j` is an integer such that 6 <= `j` <= `n`.

The `print` statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then with the string representation of `j` again. This means the output will be the value of `j` printed twice, separated by a space.

Since the exact value of `j` is not specified, we describe it using the given range: 6 <= `j` <= `n`.

Thus, the output will be the value of `j` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **j j (where j is an integer such that 6 <= j <= n)**
