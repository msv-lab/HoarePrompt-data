The given code snippet includes a `print` statement that outputs the string `'1 1'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used within the provided code snippet. The `print` statement is static and does not depend on the values of `t` or `n`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('1 1')`.
2. The string `'1 1'` is explicitly provided and does not change based on any variables or conditions.
3. The variables `t` and `n` are mentioned in the initial state but are not utilized in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'1 1'`.

Output: **1 1**
