To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state carefully.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `n` is an integer and `n` must be greater than 3.

The code snippet:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

From the initial state, we do not see any declaration or assignment to the variable `j`. The variable `j` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can't determine its value based on the given information.

Since the value of `j` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact string that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of `j`.

The `print` statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and the string representation of `j` again. Therefore, the output will be `j j` where `j` is the value of the variable `j`.

Output: **j j (where j is the value of the variable j)**
