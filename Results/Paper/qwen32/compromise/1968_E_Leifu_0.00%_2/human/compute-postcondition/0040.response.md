Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `i` is `t-1`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- `j` is 5.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `j` is explicitly given a value of 5.
- The `print` statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then the string representation of `j` again.

### Step-by-Step:
1. The value of `j` is 5.
2. `str(j)` converts `j` to its string representation, which is "5".
3. The expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` concatenates "5", a space, and "5" again, resulting in the string "5 5".

### Final Output:
Output: **5 5**
