The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('1 2')`. This statement is a simple print command that outputs the exact string provided within the parentheses.

The initial state describes the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the print statement.

Since the print statement is hardcoded to output the string `'1 2'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **1 2**
