To determine what will be printed when the `print('draw')` statement is executed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the conditions under which the print statement is executed.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is calculated based on the value of `y2` relative to `y1`.
- `h` and `w` are positive integers within specified ranges.
- `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are positive integers within specified ranges and not equal in both coordinates simultaneously.
- `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` and `m` are the first two elements of `r`.
- `x1` and `y1` are calculated based on elements of `r` and additional conditions.
- `x2` and `y2` are also calculated based on elements of `r` and additional conditions.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are derived from the calculations involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, and `m`.
- Several conditions are given that `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `a`, `b`, and `c` must satisfy.

The print statement is:
```python
print('draw')
```

The key to understanding what will be printed is to recognize that the print statement simply outputs the string `'draw'` regardless of the values of the variables defined in the initial state. The conditions and calculations described in the initial state do not affect the content of the string to be printed.

Therefore, the output of the `print('draw')` statement is:
Output: **draw**
