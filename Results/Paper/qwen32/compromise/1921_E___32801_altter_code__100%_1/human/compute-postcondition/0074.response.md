The code snippet provided modifies the value of `y2` by adding `a` to it. Given that `a` is defined as `m - y1`, the new value of `y2` will be `y2 + (m - y1)`. 

Let's update the output state accordingly:

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `h` and `w` are positive integers such that 1 <= `h` <= 10^6 and 1 <= `w` <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`; `r` is a list of integers read from the input; `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `m`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5] + (m - y1)`; `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `y2` is less than `y1`; `a` is `m - y1`; `b` is `x2 - x1`; `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `y2` has been updated to `r[5] + (m - y1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
