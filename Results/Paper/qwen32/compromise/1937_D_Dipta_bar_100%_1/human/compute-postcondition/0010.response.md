The value of `r` is assigned the length of list `B`. Since `B` is `[0, 1, 5]`, the length of `B` is `3`. Therefore, `r` is `3`. The other variables `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **A is [0, 2, 6, 9, 13] and idx_A is [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]; B is [0, 1, 5]; idx_B is [4, 3, 1]; `l` is 0; `r` is 3**.
