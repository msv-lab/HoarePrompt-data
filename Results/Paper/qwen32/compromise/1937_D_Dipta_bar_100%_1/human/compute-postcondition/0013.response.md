Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function returns the length of the longest substring of `s` that forms a valid sequence of angle brackets, where a valid sequence means every '<' has a corresponding '>' that comes after it.**
