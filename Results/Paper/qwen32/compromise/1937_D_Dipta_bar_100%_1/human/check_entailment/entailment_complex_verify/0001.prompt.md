You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of '<' and '>' characters and prints a sequence of integers. Each integer represents a calculated value based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The function does not return any value explicitly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have a grid of length `n` where each cell contains either `<` or `>`.
- A pinball placed on a cell moves according to the direction indicated by the cell's character.
- After each move, the character in the cell is inverted.
- We need to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Key Points of the Program:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid length `n` and the grid string `s`.

2. **Processing:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1(s)` which calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - Two lists `A` and `B` are used to store intermediate results.
   - The program iterates through the grid to populate `A` and `B` based on the direction of the cells.
   - It then uses these lists to calculate the total time for each starting position.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Analysis:
The program uses a complex approach involving two lists `A` and `B` to efficiently calculate the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. It leverages the fact that the movements can be precomputed and reused, which is crucial given the constraints.

However, there are a few issues with the provided program:
- **Incorrect Function Call:** The function `func_1(s)` is called inside the loop but its return value is not used. The function should return the results and they should be printed.
- **Output Formatting:** The `print()` function in `func_1` is called with `end=' '`, which is correct, but the final `print()` after the loop is unnecessary and will introduce an extra newline.
- **Logic Verification:** The logic inside `func_1` is quite complex and relies on the correct interpretation of the problem. Without a detailed step-by-step verification, it's hard to say if the calculations inside `func_1` are correct.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the logic and the issues identified, we cannot conclusively say that the program is correct without further verification. However, based on the provided code, it seems to be attempting a correct approach. The main issue is the incorrect handling of the function's return value.

### Correctness:
To definitively state the correctness, a detailed step-by-step verification of the logic inside `func_1` would be required. Assuming the logic inside `func_1` is correct, the program would be correct with the mentioned adjustments.

Given the current state of the program, the correctness is questionable due to the issues identified.

Correctness: **False**
