### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to simulate the movement of a pinball on a grid for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string of '<' and '>' characters. The pinball moves according to the direction indicated by the character in its current cell, and the character inverts after the pinball moves. The program calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

The program uses two main arrays, `A` and `B`, and their corresponding index arrays, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, to keep track of the cumulative movements of the pinball. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization and Preprocessing:**
   - `A` and `idx_A` are used to track movements from the left side of the grid.
   - `B` and `idx_B` are used to track movements from the right side of the grid.

2. **Building `A` and `idx_A`:**
   - For each cell `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous movements stored in `A` and the distance between the current index and the last recorded index in `idx_A`.
   - The index `i` is then added to `idx_A`.

3. **Building `B` and `idx_B`:**
   - For each cell `i` from `n-1` to 0, if `s[i]` is '<', it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous movements stored in `B` and the distance between the current index and the last recorded index in `idx_B`.
   - The index `i` is then added to `idx_B`.

4. **Calculating the Output:**
   - Two pointers, `l` and `r`, are used to track the current position in `A` and `B`.
   - For each cell `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the total time based on the cumulative movements stored in `A` and `B` and the distances between indices.
   - If `s[i]` is '<', it similarly calculates the total time, adjusting the pointers `l` and `r` accordingly.

The logic seems to be correct for handling the movements and calculating the time for each starting position. The program correctly processes the input and outputs the expected results based on the given example.
