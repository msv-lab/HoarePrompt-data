You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        count_u = s.count('U')
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing 'U' and 'D'. For each test case, it checks if the number of 'U's in the string is odd. If it is, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a game with coins arranged in a circle, where each coin is either facing up ("U") or facing down ("D"). Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The player who cannot make a move loses. The task is to determine if Alice will win if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations
1. **Odd vs Even Facing-Up Coins**: The solution hinges on the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins (`count_u`) is odd, Alice wins. If it is even, Bob wins. This is based on the observation that each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by 1, and the player who faces an even number of facing-up coins at the start of their turn will eventually be the one to run out of moves.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the input, counts the number of "U" in each test case, and prints "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if it is even.

### Code Review
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        count_u = s.count('U')
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Verification
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and the string `s`.
2. **Counting "U"**: The program correctly counts the number of "U" in the string `s`.
3. **Decision Making**: The program correctly decides based on whether the count of "U" is odd or even.

### Testing with Sample Inputs
Let's verify the program with the provided sample input:
```
3
5
UUDUD
5
UDDUD
2
UU
```
- **First Test Case**: `UUDUD` has 3 "U"s (odd), so the output should be "YES".
- **Second Test Case**: `UDDUD` has 2 "U"s (even), so the output should be "NO".
- **Third Test Case**: `UU` has 2 "U"s (even), so the output should be "NO".

The program produces the correct output for these test cases.

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly implement the logic based on the number of facing-up coins. It handles the input and output as described in the problem statement and produces the correct results for the given examples. There are no apparent edge cases or logical errors in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation
The program correctly identifies whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly. This decision is based on the optimal strategy for the game, ensuring that the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
