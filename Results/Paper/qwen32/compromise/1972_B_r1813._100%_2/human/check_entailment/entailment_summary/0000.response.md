### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of 'U' (facing up) coins. The key observation here is that the game's outcome depends on whether the number of 'U' coins is odd or even. If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

The provided program reads multiple test cases, counts the number of 'U' coins in the string for each test case, and prints "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if it is even. This aligns with the problem's requirement.

The execution summary confirms that the program correctly processes each test case by counting 'U's and determining the winner based on the parity of this count.
