To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It then calculates the side length of the square (`dx`) by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the corners. Finally, it prints the area of the square, which is `dx * dx`.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately, the final output state will be the series of printed areas for each test case. The variables `t`, `a`, `x`, and `dx` are local to each iteration of the loop and do not retain their values between iterations. The only output that persists is the printed results.

Given the loop processes `t` test cases, the output state will be a series of `t` printed numbers, each representing the area of a square from the corresponding test case.

Output State: **a series of t printed numbers, each representing the area of a square from the corresponding test case.**
