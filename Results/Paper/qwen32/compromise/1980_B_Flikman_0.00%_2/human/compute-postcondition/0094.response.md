Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 999; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `value` is `a[n - 1]`; `greater_count` is 0; `same_value_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`; the current value of `value` is greater than `favorite_value`.**
