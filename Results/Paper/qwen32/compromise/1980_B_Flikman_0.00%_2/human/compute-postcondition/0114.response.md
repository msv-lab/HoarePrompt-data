Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a value based on the conditions related to `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a`. Specifically, Case_1: If a certain condition is met (not detailed in the problem statement), the function returns a specific value; otherwise, Case_2: it returns a different value.**
