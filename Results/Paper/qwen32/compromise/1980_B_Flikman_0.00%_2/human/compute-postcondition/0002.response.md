The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. This means that the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, and `k` are now known, with `t` still being an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and `n`, `f`, and `k` being the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
