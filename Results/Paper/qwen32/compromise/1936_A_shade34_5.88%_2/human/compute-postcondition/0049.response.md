The code snippet creates a list named `pans` and assigns it the value `[i]`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `mak` is `i + 1`; `s` is the string input provided; `pans` is `[i]`.**
