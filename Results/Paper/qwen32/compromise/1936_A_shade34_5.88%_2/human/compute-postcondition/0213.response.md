To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is at least 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
2. `n` is the input integer (though `n` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
3. `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop (though `mak2` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
4. `mak` is the new value of `i` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
5. `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements.
6. `i` is 2.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
- `mak` can either be 0 (if the input was not `'>'`) or some value of `i` (if the input was `'>'`).
- `pans` is a list of indices where the input was `'='`, and it must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.

### Determining Values:
- Since `pans` has at least 2 elements, `pans[0]` and `pans[1]` are valid indices.
- If `mak` is 0 (which is the most common assumption given no other information about the input), then `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
- `pans[i]` translates to `pans[2]` because `i` is explicitly set to 2.

### Output:
- The print statement will output `'?'` followed by:
  - `pans[mak]` which is `pans[0]` if `mak` is 0.
  - `pans[mak]` again, which is `pans[0]` if `mak` is 0.
  - `pans[i]` which is `pans[2]`.
  - `pans[i]` again, which is `pans[2]`.

### Conclusion:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where pans is a list of indices where the input was '=' and has at least 2 elements)**
