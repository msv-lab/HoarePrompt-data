Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `mak` is 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Literal String**: The first argument to the `print` function is a literal string `'?'`. This will be printed as is.
2. **Variable `mak`**: The initial state explicitly states that `mak` is 0. Therefore, `mak` will be printed as `0`.
3. **Variable `i`**: The initial state does not provide any information about the variable `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine an explicit value for `i`. Thus, we need to describe `i` based on the information given.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe it as `i` (where `i` is an undefined variable in the given initial state).

### Output:
Combining the above analysis, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is an undefined variable in the given initial state)**
