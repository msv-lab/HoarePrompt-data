The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, and based on the value of `s`, `mak` and `pans` are updated. However, these updates do not affect the loop head variables `i` and `n`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1 (since it was updated to `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration) and ensure that `n` is still greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `s` is the new input string; `i` is `i + 2`. If `s` equals '<', `mak` is `i + 2` and `pans` is a list containing the value of `i + 1`. If `s` equals '=', `pans` contains the new value of `i + 1`.**

However, since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, the final state should be:

State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
