The value of `mak2` is updated to be equal to the value of `mak`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `pans`) remain unchanged. Since `mak` is defined as the last index `i` for which the input was `<`, or 0 if no such input was provided, `mak2` will now hold the same value.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`.**
