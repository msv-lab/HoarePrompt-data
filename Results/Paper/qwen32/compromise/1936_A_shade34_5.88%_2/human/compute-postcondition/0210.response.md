The code snippet provided assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`) remain unchanged by this assignment. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this assignment, the value of `mak` will be the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is the new value of `i`, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1**.
