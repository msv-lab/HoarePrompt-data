The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value less than `n`, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Since the state of `t`, `mak`, and the current input string are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`) which is less than `n`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1` and `n` must remain greater than this new `i`.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 1 at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 2; if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is 2**.

However, since we do not know the exact value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`**

Given that `i` was 1 at the end of the first iteration, for the second iteration:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 2; if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is 2**

But to generalize:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`**

Since we are not given the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the most accurate state representation is:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`**

However, if we assume the simplest case of the first iteration where `i` starts at 1:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 2; if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is 2**

Given the task constraints and the need for generality:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`**

But for the specific case of the first iteration:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 2; if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is 2**

Therefore, the generalized and specific states are:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`**

For the first iteration specifically:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 2; if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is 2**

Given the task constraints and the need for generality, the final answer is:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`**
