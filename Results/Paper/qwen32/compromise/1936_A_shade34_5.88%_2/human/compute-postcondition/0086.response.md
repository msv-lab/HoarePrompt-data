The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Given that `i` is 2, `mak` will be set to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is 2, `i` is 2**.
