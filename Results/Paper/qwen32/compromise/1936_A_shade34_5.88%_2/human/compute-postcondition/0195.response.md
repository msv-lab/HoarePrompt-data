The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns the list `[i]` to the variable `pans`. Given that `i` is 2, `pans` will be `[2]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `s`, `mak`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 2, `mak2` is the final value of `mak`, `s` is the new input string, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `pans` is `[2]`.**
