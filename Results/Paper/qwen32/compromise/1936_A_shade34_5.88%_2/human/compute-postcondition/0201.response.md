The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range `(1, len(pans))`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to ensure the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute, the range `(1, len(pans))` must have at least one element. This means `len(pans)` must be greater than 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1.
2. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(pans)` must be greater than 1.

Thus, we need to adjust `pans` to ensure it has more than one element.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements**
