Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 0 (but its value is not specified, and it is not used in the print statement).
- `n` must be greater than 0 (but its value is not specified, and it is not used in the print statement).
- `mak2` is equal to `mak` (the value of `mak` is not specified, but `mak2` will have the same value as `mak`).
- `pans` is an empty list (but it is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is not set initially (meaning it is in an undefined state, typically `None` in Python if it hasn't been assigned a value).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The first element in the print statement is the literal string `'?'`.
- The second element is `mak`. Since the value of `mak` is not specified, we can only refer to it as `mak`.
- The third element is `mak2`. We know that `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so we can refer to it as `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`).
- The fourth element is `i`. Since `i` is not set initially, it is `None` in Python.
- The fifth element is `mak2` again, which is the same as `mak`.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
Output: **? mak mak2 None mak2 (where mak2 is the same as mak and i is None)**

However, to provide the most precise description based on the given information, we can simplify it to:
Output: **? mak mak None mak (where mak2 is the same as mak and i is None)**
