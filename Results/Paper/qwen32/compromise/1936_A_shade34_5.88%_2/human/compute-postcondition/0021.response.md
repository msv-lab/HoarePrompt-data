The code snippet assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. Therefore, the value of `mak2` after the execution of the code will be the same as the value of `mak`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak` is the largest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `mak2` is equal to `mak`.**
