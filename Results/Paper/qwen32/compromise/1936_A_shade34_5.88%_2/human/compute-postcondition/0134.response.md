The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it is iterating over, which is `len(pans)`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is at least 0.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- `pans` is a list containing at least two indices.
- If the input is '>', then `mak` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged.

The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`. To execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `len(pans)` should remain the same or greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The length of `pans` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 indices, `i` is 2**
