To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is at least 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `mak2` is the final value of `mak`.
- `s` is the input string.
- `i` is 1.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `mak2` is described as the final value of `mak`. However, `mak` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value from the given information. We can only infer that `mak2` is the final value of whatever `mak` is.

Since `mak` is not defined, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `mak` or `mak2`. However, we can describe the output format based on the given variables.

The output will consist of:
- A literal question mark `?`.
- The value of `mak` (which is unknown).
- The value of `mak2` (which is the final value of `mak`).
- The value of `i`, which is 1.
- The value of `mak2` again.

Given this, the output can be described as:
Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 1 [mak2] (where mak2 is the final value of mak)**
