Postcondition: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements. If the current input is '>', then `mak` is set to the current index `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged.**
