The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not change the values of any variables; it simply flushes the output buffer to ensure that all output is written to the standard output immediately. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, or `mak` are affected.

Output State: **t (number of test cases) is at least 1; n is unchanged; mak2 is 0; pans is a list of all indices i for which the input was '='; mak is the index of the last element in pans for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such element exists.**
