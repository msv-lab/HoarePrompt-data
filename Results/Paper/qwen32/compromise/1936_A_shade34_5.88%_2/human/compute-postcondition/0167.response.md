The provided code snippet is simply an assignment statement that assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `mak2` now holds the same value as `mak`.

Given that `mak2` was already described as "the final value of `mak`" in the initial state, the assignment does not change this fact. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `pans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`.**
