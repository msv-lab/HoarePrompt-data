To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the range function `range(1, len(pans))`.

The loop will execute if `len(pans)` is greater than 1. This is because the loop starts with `i = 1` and iterates up to but not including `len(pans)`. If `len(pans)` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:

- `t` is at least 0
- `n` is the input integer
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`
- `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=`
- If the input string `s` was `<` at any point, `mak` is set to 0 and `pans` contains only the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`

To ensure the loop executes, `pans` must have at least two elements. Therefore, we need to adjust `pans` to have at least two indices.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing at least two indices**
