The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written out immediately. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the final value of `mak`, `s` is the input string, `i` is 1**.
