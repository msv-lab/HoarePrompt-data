To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the variables and their values based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is at least 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored for this task).
- `n` is the input integer (this variable is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored for this task).
- `mak2` is equal to `mak` (this variable is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored for this task).
- `pans` is a list containing at least 4 indices (we know `pans` has at least 4 elements).
- `i` is 3.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

#### Variables to Evaluate:
1. `mak`: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so `mak` must have some value that is a valid index for the `pans` list.
2. `pans[mak]`: This will be the element at the index `mak` in the `pans` list.
3. `pans[i]`: Since `i` is 3, this will be the element at index 3 in the `pans` list.

### Output Description:
- The print statement starts with a literal question mark `?`.
- The next two values are `pans[mak]`, which means the element at index `mak` in the `pans` list.
- The last two values are `pans[i]`, which means the element at index 3 in the `pans` list, and since `i` is 3, this is the same as `pans[3]`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `mak`, we can't determine the exact value of `pans[mak]`. However, we do know that `pans[3]` is the fourth element in the `pans` list.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where pans[mak] is the element at index mak in the pans list and pans[3] is the fourth element in the pans list)**
