Given the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and their values:

- `t` (number of test cases) is at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- `n` is unchanged, but its exact value is not specified.
- `mak2` is explicitly set to 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '='. The exact contents of this list are not specified.
- `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such element exists. Since the exact contents of `pans` and the inputs are not specified, we can only infer that `mak` will be 0 if there are no indices in `pans` that correspond to an input of '>', or it will be the index of the last such occurrence.

Since `mak2` is explicitly set to 0 and `mak` is defined based on the conditions mentioned (which we don't have specific data for), we can conclude the following:

- `mak2` will always be 0.
- `mak` will be 0 unless there are specific conditions in the input that change it, but based on the given initial state, we assume no such conditions are present.

Therefore, the print statement will output `!`, `mak2` (which is 0), and `mak` (which is 0).

Output: **! 0 0**
