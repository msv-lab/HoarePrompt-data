Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is at least 0.
2. `n` is greater than 1.
3. `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
4. `i` is 1.
5. `s` is the input string.
6. Depending on the value of `s`:
   - If `s` is equal to `<`, `pans` is `[None]`.
   - If `s` is equal to `=`, `pans` is a list containing one element `i` (which is 1).
   - Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- `mak` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we know that `mak2` is equal to `mak`. Therefore, we will refer to `mak` as `mak` and `mak2` as `mak` for clarity in the output.
- `i` is explicitly defined as 1.
- The print statement will output the literal character `?`, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

### Output:
The output will consist of the literal `?` followed by the value of `mak`, then the value of `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`), then the value of `i` (which is 1), and finally the value of `mak2` again.

Since the exact value of `mak` is not given, we describe it as `mak`.

Output: **? mak mak 1 mak (where mak is the value of mak)**
