To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` (number of test cases) is at least 1.
2. `n` is unchanged (its value is not specified but it is a constant for the context).
3. `mak` is 0.
4. `mak2` is 0.
5. `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
- `mak` is 0, so `pans[mak]` translates to `pans[0]`, which is the first element of the `pans` list.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, but since `pans` must have at least 2 elements, a reasonable assumption is that `i` might be referring to another index in `pans`. However, since `i` is not defined, we can only be certain about `pans[mak]` (which is `pans[0]`).

Given the lack of definition for `i`, we can only determine the values for `pans[mak]` and `pans[mak]` (which are both `pans[0]`). The values for `pans[i]` and `pans[i]` cannot be determined precisely without knowing the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be a string starting with '?' followed by the value of `pans[0]` twice, and the value of `pans[i]` twice, where `i` is an undefined index.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and i is an undefined index in the pans list)**
