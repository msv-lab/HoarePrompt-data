Precondition: **The function `func()` does not take any input arguments directly. Instead, it interacts with the judge through input and output operations. The interaction starts with reading the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of the secret permutation `p`. The function can then perform up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in `p`. After determining the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, the function outputs "! i j". The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
