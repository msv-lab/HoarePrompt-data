The code calculates `q` as `2 ** (p - 1)`, where `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `k`, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Since the values of `n` and `m` are given to be distinct non-negative integers such that `0 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `n != m`, `k` will be a positive integer, and `l` (the binary string representation of `k`) will have a length `p` that is at least 1.

The value of `q` is calculated based on `p`, so `q` will be a power of 2, specifically `2` raised to the power of one less than the number of bits required to represent `k` in binary.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that `0 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `n != m`; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `l` is the binary string representation of `k`; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is `2 ** (p - 1)`.**
