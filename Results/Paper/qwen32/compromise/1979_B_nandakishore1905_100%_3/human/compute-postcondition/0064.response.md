The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variables Initialization**:
   - `n` is assigned the value of `input_n`.
   - `m` is assigned the value of `input_m`.
   - `k` is assigned the value of `abs(input_n - input_m)`, which is the absolute difference between `input_n` and `input_m`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(1)` statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `n`, `m`, or `k`, their values are irrelevant to the output.

Output: **1**
