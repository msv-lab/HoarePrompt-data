The value of `f` is calculated as `k - q`. Given that `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `q` is `2`, the value of `f` becomes `k - 2`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that `0 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `n != m`; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `l` is the binary string representation of `k`; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is `2`; `f` is `k - 2`.**
