You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif k % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            f = k - q
            while f & f - 1 != 0:
                l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
                p = len(l)
                q = 2 ** (p - 1)
                f = f - q
            print(f)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference `k` and then determines and prints a specific value based on the properties of `k`. The printed value is either `k` if `k` is a power of two, `1` if `k` is odd, or the largest power of two less than or equal to the remainder when `k` is reduced by the largest power of two less than `k`, iteratively until the remainder itself is a power of two.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment of two infinite sequences \(a\) and \(b\) defined as:
- \(a_n = n \oplus x\)
- \(b_n = n \oplus y\)

Where \(x\) and \(y\) are distinct non-negative integers and \(\oplus\) denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem based on the observation that the longest common subsegment length is related to the difference \(k = |x - y|\).

Here's a breakdown of the program logic:
1. **Calculate the absolute difference** \(k = |x - y|\).
2. **Check if \(k\) is a power of 2**:
   - If \(k \& (k - 1) == 0\), then \(k\) is a power of 2, and the program prints \(k\).
3. **Check if \(k\) is odd**:
   - If \(k \% 2 != 0\), then \(k\) is odd, and the program prints 1.
4. **Handle the general case**:
   - If \(k\) is neither a power of 2 nor odd, the program calculates the largest power of 2 less than \(k\), subtracts it from \(k\), and repeats the process until the result is a power of 2. It then prints this result.

### Correctness of the Program:
The provided program is **incorrect**. Here's why:

1. **Handling of Power of 2**:
   - The condition `k & (k - 1) == 0` correctly identifies if \(k\) is a power of 2. In this case, the longest common subsegment length is indeed \(k\).

2. **Handling of Odd Numbers**:
   - The condition `k % 2 != 0` is incorrect for determining the longest common subsegment length. The longest common subsegment length for odd \(k\) is not always 1. For example, if \(k = 3\), the longest common subsegment length is 2.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The loop that subtracts the largest power of 2 from \(k\) until the result is a power of 2 does not correctly compute the longest common subsegment length. The program does not account for the correct pattern of the XOR sequences.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the length of the longest common subsegment for all possible values of \(x\) and \(y\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
