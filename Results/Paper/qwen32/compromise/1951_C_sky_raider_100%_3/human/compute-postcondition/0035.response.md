The value of `k` is decremented by `s`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `s`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - s`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `c` is `c + s * (l[0] + t)`, `t` is `t + s`.**
