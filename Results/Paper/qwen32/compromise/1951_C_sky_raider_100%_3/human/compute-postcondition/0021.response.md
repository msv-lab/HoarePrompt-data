The code snippet provided is `k -= s`. This operation reduces the value of `k` by the value of `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `3 * s`
- `n` must be greater than `s + 2`
- `m` is an integer read from the input
- `k` is an integer read from the input minus `2 * s`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`
- `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[i] + 2 * s)`
- `i` is `s + 2`

After executing `k -= s`, the value of `k` changes. Since `k` was initially defined as an integer read from the input minus `2 * s`, after subtracting `s` from `k`, `k` becomes the original `k` minus `3 * s`.

Output State: **`t` is `3 * s`; `n` must be greater than `s + 2`; `m` is an integer read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input minus `3 * s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`; `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[i] + 2 * s)`; `i` is `s + 2`.**
