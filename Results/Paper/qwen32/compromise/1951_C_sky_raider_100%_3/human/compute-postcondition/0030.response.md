The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `c`. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `t`, `s`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `t` is 0; `s` is 0; `c` is 0.**
