The code snippet initializes a variable `t` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `l`. The value of `i` remains `i + 1` as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `t` is 0.**
