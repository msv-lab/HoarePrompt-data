The code snippet `t += s` increments the value of `t` by `s`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `t`, which now equals its previous value plus `s`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - 2*s`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` is `min(m, k - 2*s)`, `t` is `t + 3*s`, `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t + s) + s * (l[2] + t)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `t` has been updated to be its original value plus `s`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
