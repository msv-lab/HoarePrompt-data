The code snippet `t += s` increments the value of `t` by the value of `s`. Given the initial state, `t` was initially set to `2 * s`. After the increment, `t` becomes `2 * s + s`, which simplifies to `3 * s`.

No other variables are modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `3 * s`; `n` must be greater than `s + 2`; `m` is an integer read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input minus `2 * s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`; `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[i] + 2 * s)`; `i` is `s + 2`.**
