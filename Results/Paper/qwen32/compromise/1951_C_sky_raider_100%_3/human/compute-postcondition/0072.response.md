To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the variables evolve with each iteration of the outer loop. Each iteration of the outer loop processes a new set of inputs (`n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a`), and the inner loop computes the total cost `c` based on these inputs.

Here's the step-by-step explanation of how the variables change:

1. **Outer Loop Iteration (`i`)**: This variable iterates from `0` to `t-1`, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Loop Iteration (`i`)**: This variable iterates from `0` to `n-1` for each test case, processing each element in the list `a`.
3. **Variables**:
   - `n`: Number of elements in the list `a`. Remains constant within each test case.
   - `m`: Maximum value for `s` in each iteration of the inner loop. Remains constant within each test case.
   - `k`: Total amount that can be distributed. Decreases by `s` in each iteration of the inner loop.
   - `a`: List of integers. Remains constant within each test case.
   - `t`: Accumulated `s` over all iterations of the inner loop for the current test case.
   - `s`: Minimum of `m` and the remaining `k` in each iteration of the inner loop.
   - `c`: Accumulated cost calculated as `sum(s * (l[i] + t))` for all iterations of the inner loop.
   
After all iterations of the outer loop, the final state will be the accumulated results from all test cases.

### Final Output State

- **`n`**: Remains the same as the last test case processed.
- **`m`**: Remains the same as the last test case processed.
- **`k`**: Will be the initial `k` of the last test case minus the total `s` distributed during the inner loop of the last test case.
- **`a`**: Remains the same as the last test case processed.
- **`t`**: Accumulated `s` over all iterations of the inner loop for the last test case.
- **`s`**: Minimum of `m` and the remaining `k` in the last iteration of the inner loop of the last test case.
- **`c`**: Accumulated cost calculated as `sum(s * (l[i] + t))` for all iterations of the inner loop across all test cases.

Since the problem asks for the final output state after all iterations, the key variable here is `c`, which accumulates the cost for all test cases.

Output State: **The final accumulated cost `c` after processing all test cases.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the total accumulated cost `c` computed from all the test cases provided in the input.
