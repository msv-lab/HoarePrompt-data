Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state of the variables.

Initial State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `m` remains unchanged
- `k` is `k - 2*s`
- `l` remains unchanged
- `s` is `min(m, k - s)`
- `t` is `t + 2*s`
- `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t + s)`

Code Snippet:
```python
s = min(m, k)
```

The code snippet updates the value of `s` to be the minimum of `m` and `k`. Since `k` is defined as `k - 2*s` from the initial state, the new value of `s` will be recalculated based on this updated `k`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - 2*s`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` is `min(m, k - 2*s)`, `t` is `t + 2*s`, `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t + s)`**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains greater than 2.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains `k - 2*s`.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `s` is now `min(m, k - 2*s)`.
- `t` remains `t + 2*s` (using the old value of `s` for this calculation).
- `c` remains `c + s * (l[1] + t + s)` (using the old value of `s` for this calculation).

Note: The values of `t` and `c` would be updated in subsequent code if they were recalculated, but based on the given code snippet, they retain their expressions involving the old value of `s`.
