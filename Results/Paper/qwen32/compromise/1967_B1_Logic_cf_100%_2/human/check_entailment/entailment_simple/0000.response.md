### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

This means that there exists an integer \(k\) such that:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

Given this equation, we can simplify it to:
\[ a = (k - 1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

Since \(\gcd(a, b)\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), let's denote \(\gcd(a, b) = d\). Then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[ dx = (k - 1) \cdot dy \cdot d \]
\[ x = (k - 1) \cdot d \cdot y \]

This implies that \(x\) must be a multiple of \(d \cdot y\). Since \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the only possible value for \(k\) is 2 (otherwise, \(x\) would have a common factor with \(y\)). Thus, we get:
\[ a = b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

This simplifies our problem to finding pairs (a, b) such that:
\[ a = b \cdot d \]
where \(d\) is a divisor of \(a\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) as follows:
1. Initialize `ans` to `n`, which accounts for the pairs where \(a = 1\) (since \(\gcd(1, b) = 1\)).
2. Iterate over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
3. For each \(b\), add \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.

Let's understand why this works:
- For each \(b\), we need to count how many multiples of \(b\) exist up to \(n\). This is given by \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).
- However, we also need to ensure that the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This translates to checking if \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\) includes valid pairs.
- The term \((n + b) // (b * b)\) effectively counts the number of valid multiples of \(b\) that satisfy the condition.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for each test case. It initializes the count with the trivial case where \(a = 1\) and then iteratively counts valid pairs for each \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
