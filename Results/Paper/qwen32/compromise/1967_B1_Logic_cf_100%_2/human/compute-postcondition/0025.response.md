The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is equal to the current iteration number, starting from 0 up to `t-1`.

Given that `T` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `T` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first positive integer from the input, `m` is the second positive integer from the input, `ans` is `n + Î£((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, `T` is `T + 1`**
