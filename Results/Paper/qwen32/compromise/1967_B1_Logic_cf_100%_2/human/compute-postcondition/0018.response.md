To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet in the context of the initial state.

Given:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is the first positive integer from the input, converted to an integer, and must be at least 2
- `m` is the second positive integer from the input, converted to an integer, and must be at least 2
- `ans` is equal to `n`
- `T` is `t`

The code snippet is:
```python
ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
```

However, there is a variable `b` that is not defined in the initial state. Since `b` is not mentioned in the initial state, we cannot proceed with the calculation without knowing its value. Assuming `b` is also a positive integer, let's denote its value as `b`.

The new value of `ans` will be:
\[ \text{new\_ans} = \text{ans} + \frac{n + b}{b \times b} \]

Since `ans` is initially equal to `n`, the new value of `ans` can be expressed as:
\[ \text{new\_ans} = n + \frac{n + b}{b^2} \]

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first positive integer from the input converted to an integer and must be at least 2, `m` is the second positive integer from the input converted to an integer and must be at least 2, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is `t`.**

In natural language: `t` remains greater than 0, `n` remains the first positive integer from the input converted to an integer and is at least 2, `m` remains the second positive integer from the input converted to an integer and is at least 2, `ans` is updated to `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, and `T` remains equal to `t`.
