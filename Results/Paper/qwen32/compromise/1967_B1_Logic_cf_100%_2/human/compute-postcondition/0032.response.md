Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b) + (n + (b + 1)) // ((b + 1) * (b + 1))`, `T` is `T + 1`, `b` is `b + 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated by adding `(n + (b + 1)) // ((b + 1) * (b + 1))` to its previous value. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `T`, and `b` remain subject to their respective constraints and have been incremented as specified.
