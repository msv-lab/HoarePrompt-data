The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `m`. Given that the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers, after the execution of the code, `n` and `m` will hold the integer values of the split input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first positive integer from the input, `m` is the second positive integer from the input.**
