To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
```

This means that the variable `b` is the only one that can be adjusted for the next iteration. The values of `n` and `m` determine the range within which `b` iterates.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` must be at least 2
- `m` must be at least 2
- `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`
- `T` is `T + 1`

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` would have taken some value within the range `[2, min(n, m)]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1, provided it is still within the valid range.

Let's denote the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration as `b_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be `b_prev + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `b_prev`, we can only express the state in terms of the increment of `b`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is `T + 1`, `b` is `b + 1` where `b` is within the range `[2, min(n, m)]`**

However, to be more precise, we should specify that `b` is incremented from its previous value:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is `T + 1`, `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, ensuring `b` is still within the range `[2, min(n, m)]`**

But since we are only adjusting the state based on the loop head, we can simplify it to:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is `T + 1`, `b` is `b + 1`**

This assumes that `b + 1` is still within the valid range `[2, min(n, m)]`. If `b + 1` exceeds `min(n, m)`, the loop will terminate, but based on the task requirement, we only adjust the variables in the loop head. 

So the final state is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is `T + 1`, `b` is `b + 1`**
