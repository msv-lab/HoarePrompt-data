To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the given output states for the first three iterations.

The loop is defined as follows:
```python
for i in range(x + 1):
    z += z // (k - 1) + 1
```

### Analysis of the Loop

- **Initialization**: Initially, `z = 0`.
- **Loop Execution**: For each iteration `i` from `0` to `x` (inclusive), `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to it.

### Given Output States

1. **After 1 iteration**:
   - `z = 1`
   - This is because `z` starts at `0`, and in the first iteration, `z` becomes `0 // (k - 1) + 1 = 1`.

2. **After 2 iterations**:
   - `z = 1 + 1 + 1 // (k - 1)`
   - This is because in the second iteration, `z` becomes `1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1) = 1 + 1 + 1 // (k - 1)`.

3. **After 3 iterations**:
   - `z = 4` if `k > 2` or `z = 5` if `k = 2`
   - This is because in the third iteration, `z` becomes `1 + 1 + 1 // (k - 1) + ((1 + 1 + 1 // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)`.

### Generalizing the Pattern

Let's generalize the pattern for `z` after `n` iterations:

- After the first iteration, `z = 1`.
- After the second iteration, `z = 1 + 1 + 1 // (k - 1)`.
- After the third iteration, `z = 1 + 1 + 1 // (k - 1) + (1 + 1 + 1 // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1`.

We can observe that each iteration adds `1 + z // (k - 1)` to `z`.

### Final Output State

The loop runs `x + 1` times. Therefore, we need to determine the value of `z` after `x + 1` iterations.

Given the pattern, the final value of `z` can be calculated iteratively. However, a closed-form solution can be derived based on the pattern observed.

For simplicity, let's denote `z_i` as the value of `z` after `i` iterations. The recursive relation is:
\[ z_{i+1} = z_i + \left\lfloor \frac{z_i}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 \]

Given the initial condition `z_0 = 0`, we can compute the final value of `z` after `x + 1` iterations.

### Conclusion

The final output state after all iterations of the loop is:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0.
- `a` is the third integer from the input.
- `z` is the value computed after `x + 1` iterations using the recursive relation above.

Let's compute the final value of `z` for a general `x` and `k`.

### Calculation

For `k > 2`:
\[ z = 2^{x+1} - 1 \]

For `k = 2`:
\[ z = 2x + 1 \]

Given the constraints and the pattern, the final output state can be expressed as:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `a` is the third integer from the input, `z` is `2^(x+1) - 1` if `k > 2` or `2x + 1` if `k = 2`.**

In natural language, the final value of `z` depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 2, `z` is `2^(x+1) - 1`. If `k` is 2, `z` is `2x + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
