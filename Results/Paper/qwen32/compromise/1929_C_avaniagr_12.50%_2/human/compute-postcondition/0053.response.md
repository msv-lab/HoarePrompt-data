Postcondition: **k is 3, x is 5, a is 7, z is 8. If a is greater than or equal to z, then a is greater than or equal to z. Otherwise, a is less than z.** 

Since the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `z` remain unchanged, the postcondition focuses on the relationship between `a` and `z` based on the if-else condition.
