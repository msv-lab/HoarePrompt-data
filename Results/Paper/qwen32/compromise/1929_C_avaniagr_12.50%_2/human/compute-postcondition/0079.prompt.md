Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case consists of three integers k, x, and a, where 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. There are `t` test cases, where `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, and `a` is the third integer from the input. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then `a` retains its value if it is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` equals `k - 1`, `a` can be either greater than or equal to `x + 3` or less than `x + 3`. Otherwise, `a` can be either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`, where `z` is `2^(x+1) - 1` if `k > 2` or `2x + 1` if `k = 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers. If `x < k - 1`, the value of `a` remains unchanged if it is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If `x == k - 1`, the state remains unchanged. If `x > k - 1`, `k` is set to 3, `x` is set to 5, `a` is set to 7, and `z` is set to 8. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to 8. Otherwise, `a` is less than 8.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are integers as read from the input, with `t` greater than 0. If `x < k - 1`, the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are preserved. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 3`, the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are also preserved. If `x != k - 1` and `k > 2`, `z` is set to `x + 1`; if `x != k - 1` and `k = 2`, `z` is set to `2^(x + 1) - 1`. If `x != k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`; otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
