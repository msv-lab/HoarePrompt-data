The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are described in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` must be greater than 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `k` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is defined as `k - 1`, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `a` is the third integer from the input and is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement only outputs the string `'YES'`, the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
