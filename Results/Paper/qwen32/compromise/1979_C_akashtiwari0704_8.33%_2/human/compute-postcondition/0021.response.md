The given code snippet increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is defined as `prod // a[i]` in the initial state, the new value of `sumo` will be the old value of `sumo` plus `prod // a[i]`.

Given the initial state, `sumo` was already calculated as `sumo + int(a[i])` before the code snippet was executed. Therefore, executing `sumo += int(a[i])` again effectively doubles the addition of `int(a[i])` to `sumo`.

However, since the problem specifies that `sumo` is initially `sumo + int(a[i])`, we should interpret the code snippet as simply adding `int(a[i])` to the current `sumo` without implying a previous addition.

Thus, the updated value of `sumo` will be its previous value plus `int(a[i])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is the previous value of `sumo` plus `int(a[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
