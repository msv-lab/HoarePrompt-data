The code appends the string representation of the element at index `i` of the list `a` followed by a space to the string `ans`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` now points to the next element in the list `a`.

Given that `bets` must be greater than `i` and `i` has been incremented, the condition `bets > i` still holds true unless `i` has reached the value of `bets` in this iteration.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` includes the new element from `a[i]` concatenated to it.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is updated to include `str(a[i]) + ' '` appended to it.**
