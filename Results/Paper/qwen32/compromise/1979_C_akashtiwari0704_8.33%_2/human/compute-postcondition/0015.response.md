The code snippet provided adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given the initial state, `sumo` was initially 0. After executing the line `sumo += int(a[i])`, `sumo` will be updated to its previous value plus the integer value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is `sumo + int(a[i])`.**
This means `sumo` has been updated to include the integer value of `a[i]` added to its previous value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
