Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is the newly input integer, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `prod` is 1, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated `a`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of each element in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space if `sumo` < `prod` at any point, `T` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `prod` has been reset to 1, while all other variables retain their previous values.
