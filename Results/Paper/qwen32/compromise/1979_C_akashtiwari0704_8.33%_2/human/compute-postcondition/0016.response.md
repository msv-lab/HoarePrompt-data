The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `bets` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]`
- `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a`
- `sumo` is `sumo + int(a[i])`

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have taken some value from `0` to `bets - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `bets` should remain unchanged as it defines the total number of iterations.

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is `sumo + int(a[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`**
