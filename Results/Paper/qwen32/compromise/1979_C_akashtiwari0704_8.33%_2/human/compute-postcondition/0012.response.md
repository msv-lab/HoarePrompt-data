The given code snippet initializes a variable `sumo` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `bets`, `a`, or `prod`. The only change is the introduction of `sumo` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is an integer representing the number of iterations, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is 0.**
