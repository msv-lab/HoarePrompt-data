### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts. There are two options:
1. Buy each yogurt at a price of `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts at a price of `b` burles.

The goal is to find the minimum cost for `n` yogurts, considering these options.

#### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Input Parsing Error**:
   - The first input integer `n` is the number of test cases, not the number of yogurts. The subsequent inputs should be `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case. The variable `c` is not defined in the problem; it should be `b`.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The logic is fundamentally flawed. The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, but `c` is not defined in the problem. It should be `b / 2`. However, even if `c` were `b`, the logic `a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The correct logic should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price versus the promotional price.
   - The logic should be:
     - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought using the promotion: `pairs = n // 2`.
     - Calculate the number of yogurts that will be bought at the regular price: `remaining = n % 2`.
     - The total cost is then `pairs * b + remaining * a`.

3. **Output Error**:
   - The output logic is incorrect. The program should output the total cost calculated based on the optimal strategy, not the comparison between `a * b` and `a * d`.

#### Annotations Analysis

The annotations describe the program's state at key points but do not address the logical errors in the code. The annotations suggest that the program is comparing `a * b` and `a * d`, which is incorrect.

#### Correct Implementation

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect due to input parsing errors, logic errors, and output errors.

#### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
