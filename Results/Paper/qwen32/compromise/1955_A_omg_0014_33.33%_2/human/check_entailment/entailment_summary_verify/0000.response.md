Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

### Problem Description
The task is to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, given that:
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts is `b` burles (promotion price).

Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts, and he should use the promotion optimally to minimize the cost.

### Program Code
Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

### Function Summary
The function summary states:
- The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It then calculates and prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` based on which value is smaller, where `d` is `c / 2`.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect and provides a detailed explanation:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d` as `c / 2` and compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This is incorrect because `d` should be `c` for two yogurts.
2. **Logic for Promotion Usage**: The program does not correctly use the promotion to minimize the cost.
3. **Handling Odd Numbers of Yogurts**: The program does not handle cases where `n` is odd correctly.

### Analysis
Let's break down the issues in the provided program:
1. **Variable Naming and Logic**:
   - The program reads `a`, `b`, and `c` but uses `c` instead of `b` for the promotion price. This is a critical mistake.
   - The calculation `d = c / 2` is incorrect because `c` is already the price for two yogurts. The comparison `a * b < a * d` is nonsensical because `b` and `d` are meant to represent different prices.

2. **Promotion Usage**:
   - The program does not correctly use the promotion by calculating the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price and handling any remaining yogurts separately.

3. **Handling Odd Numbers**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where `n` is odd. For example, if `n` is 3, it should buy two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price.

### Corrected Program
The corrected version of the program provided in the original assessment is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts to buy at promotion price
        pairs = n // 2
        # Calculate the cost for these pairs
        cost = pairs * b
        # If there is an odd number of yogurts, add the cost of one more yogurt
        if n % 2 != 0:
            cost += a
        print(cost)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost. The corrected version handles the problem correctly by using the promotion optimally and handling both even and odd numbers of yogurts appropriately.

**Final: False**
