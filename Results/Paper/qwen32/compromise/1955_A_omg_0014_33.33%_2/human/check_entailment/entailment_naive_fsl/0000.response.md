Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given promotion. The program incorrectly calculates the cost by dividing `c` (the price for two yogurts) by 2 and then comparing it with the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price `a`. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to use the promotion to minimize the cost.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d` as `c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This is incorrect because `d` is not the price per yogurt when buying two yogurts under promotion. Instead, `d` should be considered as `c` for two yogurts.

2. **Logic for Promotion Usage**: The program does not correctly use the promotion to minimize the cost. It should calculate how many pairs of two yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and then handle the remaining yogurts separately.

3. **Handling Odd Numbers of Yogurts**: The program does not correctly handle cases where `n` is odd. For example, if `n` is 3, the program should buy two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts to buy at promotion price
        pairs = n // 2
        # Calculate the cost for these pairs
        cost = pairs * b
        # If there is an odd number of yogurts, add the cost of one more yogurt
        if n % 2 != 0:
            cost += a
        print(cost)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum cost by using the promotion for as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then handling any remaining yogurt at the regular price.
