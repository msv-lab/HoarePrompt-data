Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If true, it prints "STAIR".
4. It checks if `b` is the maximum of the three integers to determine if the digits form a peak. If true, it prints "PEAK".
5. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement. However, there is a minor redundancy in the condition `elif a == b == c: print('NONE')`, as this condition is already covered by the `else` statement. But this redundancy doesn't affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
