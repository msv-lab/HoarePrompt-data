The code snippet provided reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input represents the number of test cases, and it is specified that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are mentioned to be integers within the range 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9 for each test case, but they are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.**
