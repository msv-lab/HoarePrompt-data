Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, the program has printed either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the values of a, b, and c provided. The variables a, b, and c are no longer in a defined state as they are re-assigned in each iteration of the loop.**
