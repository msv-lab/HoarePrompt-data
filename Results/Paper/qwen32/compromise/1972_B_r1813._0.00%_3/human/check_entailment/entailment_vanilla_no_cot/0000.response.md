Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. According to the problem statement, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. The program counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` and checks if this count is odd or even, appending 'YES' to the results list if odd and 'NO' if even. This approach is in line with the optimal strategy for the game.
