Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. According to the problem description, the game's outcome can be determined by checking if the number of facing-up coins is odd. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins ("YES"); otherwise, Bob wins ("NO"). The program reads the input, counts the number of 'U's in each test case, and prints "YES" or "NO" based on whether this count is odd or even. The execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case as described and outputs the correct result based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
