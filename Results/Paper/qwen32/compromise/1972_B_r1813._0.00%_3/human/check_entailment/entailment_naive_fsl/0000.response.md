Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. The logic is derived from the observation that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position, and vice versa if the number of facing-up coins is even.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Odd Number of Facing-Up Coins**: If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always choose a coin in such a way that the number of facing-up coins remains odd after her turn. This forces Bob to face an even number of facing-up coins, and he will eventually be forced into a position where there are no facing-up coins left, making him lose.

2. **Even Number of Facing-Up Coins**: If the number of facing-up coins is even, any move Alice makes will result in an odd number of facing-up coins for Bob. Bob can then always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Alice, eventually forcing Alice into a position where there are no facing-up coins left, making her lose.

The program correctly counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s` for each test case and checks if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating that Alice will win. If the count is even, it appends 'NO', indicating that Bob will win.

The program handles all edge cases, including:
- A single coin (`n = 1`), where the result depends on whether the coin is facing up or down.
- Two coins (`n = 2`), where the result again depends on the number of facing-up coins.
- Larger values of `n` up to 100, as specified in the problem constraints.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases as required.
