You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins.

    #   - `index`: After `t` iterations, `index` will have been incremented by 2 for each iteration, so `index` will be `1 + 2*t`.
    #   - `t`: Remains unchanged.
    #   - `results`: Will contain `t` elements, each 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the count of 'U' in each corresponding string `s` is odd or even.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after the loop completes all iterations is:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. The logic is derived from the observation that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position, and vice versa if the number of facing-up coins is even.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Odd Number of Facing-Up Coins**: If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always choose a coin in such a way that the number of facing-up coins remains odd after her turn. This forces Bob to face an even number of facing-up coins, and he will eventually be forced into a position where there are no facing-up coins left, making him lose.

2. **Even Number of Facing-Up Coins**: If the number of facing-up coins is even, any move Alice makes will result in an odd number of facing-up coins for Bob. Bob can then always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Alice, eventually forcing Alice into a position where there are no facing-up coins left, making her lose.

The program correctly counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s` for each test case and checks if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating that Alice will win. If the count is even, it appends 'NO', indicating that Bob will win.

The program handles all edge cases, including:
- A single coin (`n = 1`), where the result depends on whether the coin is facing up or down.
- Two coins (`n = 2`), where the result again depends on the number of facing-up coins.
- Larger values of `n` up to 100, as specified in the problem constraints.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases as required.
