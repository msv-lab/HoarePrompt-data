You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 78) and prints three characters based on the value of `n`. The characters are derived by converting certain values to letters from 'a' to 'z'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's examine the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to decode a given integer back into the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word. The integer represents the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

### Program Analysis
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the provided program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - It initializes an empty list `arr`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice (for the first two letters) and appends either `1` or `26` to `arr` based on the value of `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends `1` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends `26` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it also appends `26` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts the list `arr` to ensure the smallest possible lexicographical order.
   - It then prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Handling of Values:**
   - The logic for appending `1` or `26` to `arr` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the values in a way that ensures the smallest lexicographical order.
   - The final value of `lex` is directly appended to `arr` without ensuring it is within the valid range (1 to 26).

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting `arr` might not always give the correct result because the initial values appended do not guarantee the smallest lexicographical order.

3. **Output:**
   - The program does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, one should:
- Start with the smallest possible letters ('a', 'a', 'a').
- Incrementally increase the letters to reach the target sum while maintaining the smallest lexicographical order.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded integer.

**Correctness: False**
