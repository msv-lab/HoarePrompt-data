Let's examine the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to decode a given integer back into the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word. The integer represents the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

### Program Analysis
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the provided program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - It initializes an empty list `arr`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice (for the first two letters) and appends either `1` or `26` to `arr` based on the value of `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends `1` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends `26` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it also appends `26` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts the list `arr` to ensure the smallest possible lexicographical order.
   - It then prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Handling of Values:**
   - The logic for appending `1` or `26` to `arr` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the values in a way that ensures the smallest lexicographical order.
   - The final value of `lex` is directly appended to `arr` without ensuring it is within the valid range (1 to 26).

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting `arr` might not always give the correct result because the initial values appended do not guarantee the smallest lexicographical order.

3. **Output:**
   - The program does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, one should:
- Start with the smallest possible letters ('a', 'a', 'a').
- Incrementally increase the letters to reach the target sum while maintaining the smallest lexicographical order.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded integer.

**Correctness: False**
