The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `cases` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is 1, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26**
