The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop will iterate as long as `k` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than 3. However, since `k` is already 3, the loop will not execute again in this case.

Since the loop will not execute again, there is no need to adjust the state for another iteration. The state remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is either [1, 1, lex], [1, lex, 26], or [lex, 26, 26] where `lex` is adjusted to be between 1 and 26**
