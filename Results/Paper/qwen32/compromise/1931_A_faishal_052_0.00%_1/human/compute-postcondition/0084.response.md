The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `k` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is 1, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26**
