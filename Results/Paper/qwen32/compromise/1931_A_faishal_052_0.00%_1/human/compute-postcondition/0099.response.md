Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 and less than 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26, so if `lex` was originally between 27 and 51, it is now between 1 and 25. All other variables remain unchanged.
