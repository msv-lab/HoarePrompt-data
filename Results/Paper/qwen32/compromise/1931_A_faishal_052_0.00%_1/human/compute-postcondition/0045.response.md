The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `cases` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `cases` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is either [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], or [26, 26, lex], and `lex` has been adjusted based on its initial value and is now either `lex - 2` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 27` if the initial `lex` was greater than 26 but less than 52, or `lex - 52` if the initial `lex` was 52 or greater, `k` is 3**
