To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 (This variable does not affect the current print statement, so it can be ignored for this specific print statement).
- `cases` is greater than 0 (Again, this variable does not affect the current print statement).
- `i` is 0 (This variable does not affect the current print statement).
- `j` is 1 (This variable does not affect the current print statement).
- `arr` is either `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, or `[26, 26, lex]`.
- `lex` has been adjusted based on its initial value:
  - If the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `lex` is now `lex - 2`.
  - If the initial `lex` was greater than 26 but less than 52, `lex` is now `lex - 27`.
  - If the initial `lex` was 52 or greater, `lex` is now `lex - 52`.
- `k` is 1 (This variable is used in the print statement).

### Code Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```
- `arr[k]` means `arr[1]` because `k` is 1.
- `arr[1]` can be either 1, 26, or 26 based on the possible values of `arr`.
- `chr(arr[k] + 96)` converts the integer value of `arr[1] + 96` to its corresponding ASCII character.

### Calculating the Output:
- If `arr[1]` is 1, then `chr(arr[1] + 96)` is `chr(1 + 96)` which is `chr(97)` which is `'a'`.
- If `arr[1]` is 26, then `chr(arr[1] + 96)` is `chr(26 + 96)` which is `chr(122)` which is `'z'`.

Since `arr[1]` can only be 1 or 26 (given the possible values of `arr`), the output will be either `'a'` or `'z'`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output either `'a'` or `'z'` depending on the value of `arr[1]`.

Output: **'a' or 'z' (depending on the value of arr[1])**
