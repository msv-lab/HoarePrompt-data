Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 (this value does not affect the given print statement).
- `cases` is greater than 1 (this value does not affect the given print statement).
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is 2.
- `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is 1, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Analysis:
1. The variable `k` is 2.
2. Therefore, `arr[k]` will be `arr[2]`.
3. The value of `arr[2]` depends on the value of `lex`:
   - If `lex` is 1, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]`, so `arr[2]` is 1.
   - If `lex` is 26, `arr` is `[1, 26, 26]`, so `arr[2]` is 26.
4. The `chr()` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
5. Adding 96 to `arr[2]`:
   - If `arr[2]` is 1, `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is 'a'.
   - If `arr[2]` is 26, `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is 'z'.
6. The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function means that no newline character will be added after the printed value.

### Conclusion:
The output depends on the value of `lex`:
- If `lex` is 1, the output will be 'a'.
- If `lex` is 26, the output will be 'z'.

Since the exact value of `lex` is not provided, we must describe the output in terms of `lex`.

### Final Output:
Output: **'a' if lex is 1, 'z' if lex is 26**
