The only variable in the loop head is `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is in the range specified by the `range(3)` function, which means `k` should be 0 initially, as the loop will iterate over `k` values 0, 1, and 2.

Given the initial state, `k` is set to 3, which is outside the range for the first iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to 0 to ensure the loop executes.

The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `arr`, and `lex`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 0, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is 1, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26**
