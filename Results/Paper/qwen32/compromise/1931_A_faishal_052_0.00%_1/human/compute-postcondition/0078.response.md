Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` is either [1, 1, 1] or [26, 1, 1], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 2. If `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` is [26, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], or [26, 26, 1], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 27 or 53. If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `arr` is [26, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], or [26, 26, 1], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 27 or 53, and can be -1, 25, or a value between 25 and 50. If `lex` was originally greater than 26, `arr` can also be [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 26 or 52, and can be 0, 26, or a value between 26 and 51.**
