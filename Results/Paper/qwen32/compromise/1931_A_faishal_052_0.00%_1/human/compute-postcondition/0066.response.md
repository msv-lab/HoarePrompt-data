Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` is [1, 26] and `lex` is now `lex` minus 1. If `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is now `lex` minus 26. If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is now `lex` minus 26.**

In simpler terms, the `arr` list now includes an additional element `26` appended to it. The value of `lex` has been adjusted accordingly based on its original value, and all other variables remain unchanged.
