To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step.

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `cases` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is 1, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26.

2. **Relevant part of the code:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `k` is 0, so `arr[k]` refers to the first element of `arr`.
   - Depending on the value of `lex`, `arr` can be either `[1, 1, 1]` or `[1, 26, 26]`.
   - In both cases, `arr[0]` (which is `arr[k]` when `k` is 0) is 1.
   - The expression `arr[k] + 96` evaluates to `1 + 96`, which is 97.
   - The `chr` function converts the ASCII value 97 to its corresponding character, which is 'a'.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the character 'a' without a newline at the end due to `end=''`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **a**
