The code snippet appends the integer `26` to the list `arr`. Therefore, `arr` is no longer an empty list but contains the single element `26`. The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, and `lex` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is an input integer greater than 52.**
