The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` can be either `[1]` or `[26]`. After appending `26`, if `arr` was `[1]`, it becomes `[1, 26]`. If `arr` was `[26]`, it becomes `[26, 26]`. The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26], and if `lex` is an integer such that 0 <= lex <= 25, `arr` is [1, 26]. If `lex` is an integer greater than 25, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` remains unchanged.**
