Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` is either [1, 1, 1] or [26, 1, 1], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 1. If `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` is [26, 1, 1] or [1, 26, 1] or [26, 26, 1], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 26 or 52. If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `arr` is [26, 1, 1] or [1, 26, 1] or [26, 26, 1], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 26 or 52, and can be 0, 26, or a value between 26 and 51.**

In simpler terms: The value of `arr` has been updated by appending `1` to it, so `arr` now contains an additional `1` at the end. The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `lex` remain unchanged.
