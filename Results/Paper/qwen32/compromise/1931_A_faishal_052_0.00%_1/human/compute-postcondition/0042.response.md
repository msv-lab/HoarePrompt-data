The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is either [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], or [26, 26, lex], and `lex` has been adjusted based on its initial value and is now either `lex - 2` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 27` if the initial `lex` was greater than 26 but less than 52, or `lex - 52` if the initial `lex` was 52 or greater, `k` is 2**
