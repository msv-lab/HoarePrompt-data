Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is [26], `lex` is the integer value provided by the user input and `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `k` is 3.**

The only change is that the list `arr` now contains the integer `26`. All other variables retain their initial values.
