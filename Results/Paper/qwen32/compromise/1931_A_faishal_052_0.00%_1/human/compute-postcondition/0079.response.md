The provided loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, meaning it will execute exactly 2 times for each value of `i`. However, the description of the output states after the first 3 iterations suggests that there might be some confusion in the problem statement, as the loop only has 2 iterations per `i`.

Let's clarify the loop behavior for 2 iterations:

1. **First Iteration (`j = 0`)**:
   - If `lex <= 26`, append `1` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by 1.
   - If `26 < lex < 52`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by 26.
   - If `lex >= 52`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by 26.

2. **Second Iteration (`j = 1`)**:
   - Repeat the same logic as the first iteration.

Given the loop only runs 2 times, the final output state after all iterations (2 iterations) for a given `i` would be:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `cases` remains greater than 1.
- `i` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
- `j` will be 2 after the loop completes.
- `k` remains 3.
- `arr` will have 2 elements based on the conditions described above.
- `lex` will be adjusted based on the initial value and the conditions described.

Let's describe the final output state in natural language:

- The variable `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `cases` remains unchanged and is still greater than 1.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged as it was before the loop started.
- The variable `j` is now 2, indicating the loop has completed its 2 iterations.
- The variable `k` remains 3.
- The variable `arr` will contain 2 elements. Each element is either `1` or `26` depending on the initial value of `lex` and the conditions in the loop.
- The variable `lex` will be adjusted based on the initial value and the conditions in the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list of 2 elements where each element is either 1 or 26 based on the initial value of `lex`, and `lex` is adjusted based on the initial value and the conditions in the loop.**
