The code `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The values of `cnt`, `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `num` is the next element in `N` to be processed, `cur` is equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is `1`.**
