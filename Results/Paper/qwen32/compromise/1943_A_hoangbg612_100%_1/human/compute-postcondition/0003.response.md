The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list `N`. The variables `T` and `S` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
