The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If there are more elements in `N` after the currently processed element, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the next element in `N` after the previously processed element. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the next element in `N` after the current `num`.

Given that `N` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements, and `num` is the next element after the previously processed element, we need to update `num` to the subsequent element in `N`.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the next element in `N` after the current `num`, and `M[cur]` is updated as follows: if `num` > `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1; otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
