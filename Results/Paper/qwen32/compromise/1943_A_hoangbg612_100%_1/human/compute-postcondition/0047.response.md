The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the variable `k` to the list `cnt`. Given the initial state, `cnt` either contains the key `k` if `M[k]` equals 1, or it is an empty list. After executing the code, `cnt` will definitely contain the key `k` as the last element, regardless of its previous state.

Output State: **`cur` is the last element of `N` that was processed without breaking the loop, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the sum of the values in `M`, and `cnt` is a list that now includes `k` as its last element. `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after `cur`.**
