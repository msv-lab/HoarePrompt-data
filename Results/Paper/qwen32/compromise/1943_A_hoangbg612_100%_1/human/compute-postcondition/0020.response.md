Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the next element in `N` after the previously processed element, `cur` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain as they were before the `break` statement, except that `cur` has been incremented by 1. The loop or if statement we were directly inside is exited.
