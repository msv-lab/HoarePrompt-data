The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The value of `num` is greater than `cur` and also greater than `cur + 1` (i.e., `num` is greater than 0). Since `cur` is being set to `num`, the condition `num > cur + 1` will no longer be directly applicable in the same way as before because `cur` is now equal to `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is equal to `num`.**
