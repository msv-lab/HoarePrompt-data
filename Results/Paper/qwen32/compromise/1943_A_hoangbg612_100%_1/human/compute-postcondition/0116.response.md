The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Given that `cur` was -1, it is now 0. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `cur` is 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is greater than `cur` (which is 0), and the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1` (i.e., `num` is greater than 1).**
