The code assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. No other variables are affected in this execution.

Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and `1` as its value, `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is equal to `num`.**
