The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. This operation modifies the list `cnt` by adding the element `k` to it. The other variables (`cur`, `M`, `S`, `T`, `N`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the largest number in `N` processed without a gap greater than 1, incremented by 1 if the sum of the counts of all unique numbers in `M` equals `S`. `M` is a dictionary with counts of each unique number in `N` and must have at least one key-value pair. `cnt` is a list (potentially empty) with `k` appended to it. `S` is the integer value from user input. `T` is decremented by 1. `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order. `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after the last processed key.**
