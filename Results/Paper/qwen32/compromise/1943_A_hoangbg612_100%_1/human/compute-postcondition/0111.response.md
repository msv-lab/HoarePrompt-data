The code snippet assigns `-1` to the variable `cur`. This change does not affect the values of `cnt`, `T`, `S`, or `N`. The length of `cnt` and its relationship to `cur` are no longer relevant after this assignment because `cur` is explicitly set to `-1`.

Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `cur` is -1.**
