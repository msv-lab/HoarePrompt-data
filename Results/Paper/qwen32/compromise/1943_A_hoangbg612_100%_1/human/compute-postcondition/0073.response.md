Output State: **`cur` is either `num + 1` or `0`, `M` is either `{num: 1}` or `{-1: 1}`, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one integer, `num` is the next element in `N` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `cur`, `M`, `S`, `cnt`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged. The variable `T` is decremented by 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
