Postcondition: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `num` is the next element in `N` to be processed. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1.**
