Output State: **`cur` is -1, `M` remains unchanged, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from `M` that have a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is explicitly set to -1. All other variables (`M`, `S`, `cnt`, `T`, and `N`) remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.
