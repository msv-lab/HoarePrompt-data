Postcondition: **`cur` is the largest number in `N` processed without a gap greater than 1, incremented by 1 if the sum of the counts of all unique numbers in `M` equals `S`. `M` is a dictionary with counts of each unique number in `N` and must have at least one key-value pair. If `M[k] == 1`, `cnt` is a list containing the value `k`. If `M[k] != 1`, `cnt` remains an empty list. `S` is the integer value from user input. `T` is decremented by 1. `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order.**
