The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` adds the key `k` to the list `cnt`. This means that `cnt` will now include `k` as an additional element. The values of `cur`, `M`, `S`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`cur` is the last element of `N` that was processed without breaking the loop, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the sum of the values in `M`, `cnt` is a list containing the key `k` (and any previous elements it had), and `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after the last processed key.**
