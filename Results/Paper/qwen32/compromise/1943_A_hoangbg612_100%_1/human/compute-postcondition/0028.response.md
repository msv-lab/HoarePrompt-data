Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the next element in `N` after the current `num`, and `M[cur]` is updated as follows: if `num` > `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1; otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. `cur` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, `M[cur]`, or `cur`. The only change is the termination of the loop or if statement.
