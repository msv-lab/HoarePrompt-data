Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt` is an empty list; `T` is `T-1`; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `cur` is the last element of `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element of `N`; `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their counts.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one unique element, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their counts, and `M` must be non-empty. If `M[k]` equals 1, `cnt` contains the element `k`. `cur` is the last element of `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element of `N`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one unique element, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their counts, and `M` must be non-empty. If `M[k]` equals 1, `cnt` includes `k` as its last element. `cur` is the last element of `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element of `N`. `k` is the next key in the iteration order of `M.keys()`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one unique element, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their counts, and `M` must be non-empty. If `M[k]` is 1, `cnt` has the last element being `k`. `cur` is the last element of `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element of `N`. `k` is the next key in the iteration order of `M.keys()`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
