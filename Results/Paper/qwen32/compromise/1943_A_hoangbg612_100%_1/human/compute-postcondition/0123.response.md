Postcondition: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and `1` as its value, and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `cur` remains `-1`, and `M` is a dictionary with `-1` as a key and `1` as its value.**
