Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the number of test cases. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
