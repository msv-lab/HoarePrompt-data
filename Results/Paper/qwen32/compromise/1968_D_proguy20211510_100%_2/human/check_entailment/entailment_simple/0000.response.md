### Reasoning:

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles the input and output as specified. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`, which are the length of the permutation, the number of turns, Bodya's starting position, and Sasha's starting position, respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the path that Bodya will follow by starting from `pb` and moving according to the permutation `p` until a cycle is detected. The scores along this path are stored in `pathb`.
   - Similarly, it calculates the path that Sasha will follow, starting from `ps`, and stores the scores in `paths`.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each player, the program calculates the maximum possible score they can achieve by considering all possible ways to stay or move in each turn up to `k` turns.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the path and calculates the score for each possible number of turns, storing the maximum score in `resb` for Bodya and `ress` for Sasha.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the scores for both players, the program compares `resb` and `ress` and prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input parsing, path calculation, score calculation, and result comparison accurately. The use of a visited array ensures that cycles in the permutation are detected correctly, preventing infinite loops.

Given that the program correctly follows the problem's requirements and handles the provided example correctly, we can conclude that the program is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
