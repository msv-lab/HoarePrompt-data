You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists `p` and `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible score for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`, the list `p` which determines the next position to move to, and the list `a` which contains the scores at each position. The function then prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal. This is done up to `k` moves for each player.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code has a few issues that can cause incorrect results in certain cases:

1. **Handling of Cycles and Non-Cycles in Permutations:**
   - The code correctly identifies cycles in the permutation for both Bodya and Sasha. However, it does not handle the case where the number of turns `k` is greater than the length of the cycle plus the number of unique elements before the cycle starts. For example, if `k` is very large, the code should account for the fact that the score will eventually stabilize after a full cycle is completed.

2. **Calculation of Scores:**
   - The code calculates the score by summing up the values of `a` for each position in the path until `k` turns are completed. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where `k` is larger than the length of the path. Specifically, it does not account for the repeated addition of the cycle values after the initial unique path is traversed.

3. **Edge Case with Large `k`:**
   - Consider a scenario where `k` is very large, and the permutation has a short cycle. The code should correctly sum the values of the unique path and then add the sum of the cycle values repeatedly until `k` turns are completed. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

### Example Case to Illustrate the Issue:

Let's consider a test case:

```
1
4 10 1 1
2 3 4 1
1 2 3 4
```

Here, `n = 4`, `k = 10`, `P_B = 1`, `P_S = 1`, `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, and `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.

- For Bodya and Sasha, the path is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` which forms a cycle.
- The scores should be calculated as follows:
  - For the first 4 turns, the scores are `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`.
  - For the next 6 turns (since `k = 10`), the scores will be `10 + (2 + 3 + 4 + 1) * 1 + (2 + 3 + 4 + 1) * 1 + (2 + 3 + 4 + 1) * 1 + (2 + 3 + 4 + 1) * 1 = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50`.

The code does not handle this correctly as it does not account for the repeated addition of the cycle values after the initial unique path is traversed. This can lead to incorrect results for large values of `k`.

Therefore, the code is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
