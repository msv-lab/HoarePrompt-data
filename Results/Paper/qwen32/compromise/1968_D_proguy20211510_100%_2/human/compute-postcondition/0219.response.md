The code snippet `vis[ps - 1] = 1` sets the element at index `ps - 1` in the list `vis` to 1. This means that the element at the position indicated by `ps - 1` in the `vis` list is now marked as visited.

Given the initial state, all elements in `vis` were initially set to 0. After executing the code snippet, only the element at index `ps - 1` will be 1, and all other elements in `vis` will remain 0.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate; `ps` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pathb` is a list that now includes the elements from `a` visited before a cycle was detected; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1; `preb` is the sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths` (which remains 0); `i` is the number of completed iterations of the loop, which is the minimum of `len(paths)` and `k` (which remains 0); `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for `j` in the range of the loop (which remains unchanged); `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
