The code appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the `pathb` list. Since `pathb` was initially an empty list, it will now contain one element, which is `a[pb - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1.**
