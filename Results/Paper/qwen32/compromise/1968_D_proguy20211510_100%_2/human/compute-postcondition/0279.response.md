Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `ps` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list that now includes the elements from `a` visited before a cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` visited before the cycle was detected, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`, `i` is `min(len(pathb), k)`, `resb` is the maximum of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `resb` is greater than `ress`**
