Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to the program state for the loop to proceed.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1.**
