For the given task, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will execute indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered within the loop body. Since the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once, no modifications to the program state are necessary to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

Thus, we simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the element at index `pb - 1` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`. Additionally, `resb` is the greater of the two values `resb` and `ress`. If `ress` was greater than `resb`, `resb` is updated to the value of `ress`.**
