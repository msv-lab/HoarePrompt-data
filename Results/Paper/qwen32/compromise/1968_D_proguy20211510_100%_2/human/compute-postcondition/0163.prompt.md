Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is the value causing the cycle detection, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]` up to the value causing the cycle detection, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is the value causing the cycle detection, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected and must have at least 1 element, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]` up to the value causing the cycle detection, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is max(0, `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`), `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`. Additionally, if `k` is less than `i + 1`, then `k` is less than `i + 1`. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is the value causing the cycle detection, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected and must have at least 1 element, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]` up to the value causing the cycle detection, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is max(resb, `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`), `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i] * 2`, `pres` is 0, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths)) + 1`. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is the value causing the cycle detection, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected and must have at least 1 element, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]` up to the value causing the cycle detection, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i] + pathb[i] * 2`, `pres` is 0, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
