Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the loop to terminate (i.e., `vis[pb - 1]` is 1), `ps` is the value causing the loop to terminate, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except for the indices corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, which are set to 1, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the loop to terminate (i.e., `vis[pb - 1]` is 1), `ps` is the value causing the loop to terminate, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing at least one element, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except for the indices corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, which are set to 1, `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the original value of `preb` plus `pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the loop to terminate, `ps` is the value causing the loop to terminate, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing at least one element, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except for the indices corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, which are set to 1, `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the original value of `preb` plus `pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the loop to terminate, `ps` is the value causing the loop to terminate, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing at least one element, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except for the indices corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, which are set to 1, `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the original value of `preb` plus `pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, and `i` is `i + 2`. If `k < i + 1`, the loop or statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
