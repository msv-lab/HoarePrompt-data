The code snippet provided updates the value of the variable `curr` based on the current values of `preb`, `pathb[i]`, `k`, and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `curr` is calculated as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. Since `preb` is 0 and `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `curr = 0 + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, which further simplifies to `curr = pathb[0] * k`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `ps` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list that contains at least one element from `a`, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` visited before the cycle was detected, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is 0, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `curr` is `pathb[0] * k`.**
