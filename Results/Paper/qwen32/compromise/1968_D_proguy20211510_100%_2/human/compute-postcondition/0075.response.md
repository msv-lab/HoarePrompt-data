Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the loop to terminate, `ps` is the value causing the loop to terminate, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected and must have at least 1 element, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except for the indices corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, which are set to 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is max(ress, curr), `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is the previous value of `pres` plus `paths[i]`, and `i` is 0; `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.**

In natural language: The value of `ress` has been updated to the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
