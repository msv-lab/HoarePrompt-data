The code snippet `paths.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the value `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. 

Given the initial state, `paths` already contains the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]`. However, since the code snippet appends `a[ps - 1]` again, `paths` will now have an additional `a[ps - 1]` at the end.

The other variables remain unchanged. The loop is broken out of if `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, which is already given in the initial state. The values of `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]` and an additional `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`. Additionally, `resb` is the greater of the two values `resb` and `ress`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the loop is broken out of.**
