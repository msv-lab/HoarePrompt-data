The given code snippet sets the values of `preb` and `pres` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate; `ps` is the index that caused the loop to terminate; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pathb` is a list that now includes the elements from `a` visited before a cycle was detected; `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` visited before the cycle was detected; `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1; `preb` is 0; `pres` is 0; `i` is the number of completed iterations of the loop, which is the minimum of `len(paths)` and `k` (which remains 0); `resb` is 0; `ress` is 0; `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
