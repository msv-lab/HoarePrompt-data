Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate; `ps` is the index that caused the loop to terminate; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pathb` is a list that now includes the elements from `a` visited before a cycle was detected; `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` visited before the cycle was detected; `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is 0; `i` is the minimum of `len(pathb)` and `k`; `resb` is the maximum of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for `j` from 0 to `i - 1`; `ress` is 0; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `ps` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list that now includes the elements from `a` visited before a cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` visited before the cycle was detected and must have at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is `paths[i]`, `i` is the minimum of `len(pathb)` and `k`, `resb` is the maximum of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `curr` is `paths[i] * (k - i)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `ps` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list that now includes the elements from `a` visited before a cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` visited before the cycle was detected and must have at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is `2 * paths[i]`, `i` is the minimum of `len(pathb)` and `k` plus 1, provided `i` is less than `len(paths)`, `resb` is the maximum of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `ps` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list that now includes the elements from `a` visited before a cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` visited before the cycle was detected and must have at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is `3 * paths[i]`, `i` is the minimum of `len(pathb)` and `k` plus 2, provided `i` is less than `len(paths)`, `resb` is the maximum of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
