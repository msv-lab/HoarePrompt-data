Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `ps` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list that contains at least one element from `a`, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` visited before the cycle was detected, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is 0, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, and `k` is less than `i + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the loop to terminate immediately without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `preb`, `pres`, `i`, `resb`, and `ress` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the loop or if statement.
