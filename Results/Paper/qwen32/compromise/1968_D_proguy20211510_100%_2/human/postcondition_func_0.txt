The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists `p` and `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible score for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`, the list `p` which determines the next position to move to, and the list `a` which contains the scores at each position. The function then prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal. This is done up to `k` moves for each player.
