Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array `arr`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in `arr` that the function is currently processing, and `is_already_stairs` is `False`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. If `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i`, no additional changes are made to `res`. Otherwise, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` and any changes made by the recursive call `make_stairs(i - 1)` to `res`.**
