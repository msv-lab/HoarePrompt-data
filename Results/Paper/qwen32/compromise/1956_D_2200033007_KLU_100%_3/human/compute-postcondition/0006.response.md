Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array `arr`, and `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in `arr` that the function is currently processing; `is_already_stairs` is `False`, indicating that not all elements in the subarray from `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` satisfy `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` in the range from `0` to `i`. The current value of `i` is `0`.**
