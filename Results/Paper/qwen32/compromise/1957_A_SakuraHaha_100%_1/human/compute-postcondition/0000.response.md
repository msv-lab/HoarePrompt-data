Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input.**

In simple terms: The number of sticks `n` for the first test case is now assigned the value of the first integer input. The other variables (`t`, and the lengths of the sticks `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain as described in the initial state.
