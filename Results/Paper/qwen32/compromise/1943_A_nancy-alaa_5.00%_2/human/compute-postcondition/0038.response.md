The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it by spaces, converts each split string into an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `arr`. The initial state of `arr` is specified to be "unchanged," but since this line of code reassigns `arr`, the new value of `arr` will be the list of integers provided by the user input.

The other variables (`i`, `first`, `n`, `mpp`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their values remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `first` is `True` if there was at least one element in `arr` that appeared exactly once and was not the first such element encountered, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `mpp` is unchanged**.
