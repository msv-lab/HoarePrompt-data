The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It only affects the control flow by exiting the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
