Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`, `first` is `False`, and `i` is not a key in `mpp` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
