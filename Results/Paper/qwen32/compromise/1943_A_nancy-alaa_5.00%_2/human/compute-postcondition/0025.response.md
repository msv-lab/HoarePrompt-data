Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i`. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken and `first` remains `True`. Otherwise, `first` is not specified to be changed and the condition of `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` being `True` does not lead to a break.**
