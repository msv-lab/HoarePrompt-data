Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `first` is True if `mpp[2]` was 1, otherwise `first` is False, `n` is greater than 0, and `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input. `mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`. If `mpp[2]` is 1, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as well.**
