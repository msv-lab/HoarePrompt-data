The code snippet `mpp = Counter(arr)` updates the `mpp` variable to be a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`. This means `mpp` will now hold a dictionary-like structure where keys are the unique integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts.

The values of `i`, `first`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The variable `first` is still True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once, otherwise False. The variable `n` is still the input integer, and `arr` is still the list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once, otherwise False, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.**
