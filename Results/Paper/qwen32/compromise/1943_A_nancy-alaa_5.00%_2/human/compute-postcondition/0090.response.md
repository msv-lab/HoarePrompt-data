Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `first` is True.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Based on the initial state, the value of `i` is explicitly given as 1. There are no operations or conditions in the provided snippet that alter the value of `i`. Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
