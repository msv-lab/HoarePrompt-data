Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `first` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, and `mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`. If `first` was True and `mpp[i]` was equal to 1, then `first` is now False. Otherwise, no changes are made to `first`.**
