Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `first` is True, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `i`, `n`, `first`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without altering any of these variables.
