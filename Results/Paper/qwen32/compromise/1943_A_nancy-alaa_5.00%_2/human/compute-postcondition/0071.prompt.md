Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `first` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `first` is True if `mpp[i]` was 1, otherwise `first` remains False, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, and `mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `first` is True if `mpp[i]` was 1, otherwise `first` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, and `mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`. If `mpp[i]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `first` is True if `mpp[2]` was 1, otherwise `first` is False, `n` is greater than 0, and `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input. `mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`. If `mpp[2]` is 1, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as well.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
