Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `first` is True.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since the value of `i` is explicitly given as 2, and there are no operations in the provided code snippet that modify the value of `i`, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **2**
