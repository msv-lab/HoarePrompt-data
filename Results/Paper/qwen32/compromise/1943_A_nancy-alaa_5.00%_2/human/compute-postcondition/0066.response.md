Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is set to 2.
- `first` is a boolean value determined by whether `mpp[2]` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`.
- If `i` (which is 2) is not in the keys of `mpp`, the state remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given the value 2.
- The code snippet only prints the value of `i`, and does not depend on the values of `first`, `n`, `arr`, or `mpp` for this particular print statement.

### Conclusion:
- The print statement will output the value of `i`, which is 2.

### Output:
Output: **2**
