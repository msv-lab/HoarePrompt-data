Output State: **`i` is 0, `first` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`. The current value of `i` is not a key in `mpp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `i`, `first`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged. The loop or if statement we were inside is exited.
