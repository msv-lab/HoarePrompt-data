`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`i`, `first`, `arr`, `mpp`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `first` is `True` if there was at least one element in `arr` that appeared exactly once and was not the first such element encountered, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is unchanged, `mpp` is unchanged**.
