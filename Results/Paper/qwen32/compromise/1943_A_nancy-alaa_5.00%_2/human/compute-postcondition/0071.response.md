To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the logical flow of the loop based on the given conditions.

The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. Here's a breakdown of the conditions inside the loop:

1. **If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`**:
   - This means the integer `i` does not exist in the list `arr`.
   - The loop prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

2. **If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`**:
   - This means the integer `i` has appeared exactly once in `arr` and we've already encountered another integer that appeared exactly once before.
   - The loop prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **If `mpp[i] == 1`**:
   - This means the integer `i` has appeared exactly once in `arr`.
   - The variable `first` is set to `True`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n-1` (but this is not used in the loop head).
- `first` is `False`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that keeps track of the count of each element in `arr`.

Let's consider the loop's behavior:
- The loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each `i`, it checks the conditions in the order mentioned above.

The loop will terminate either when:
- It finds an `i` that is not in `mpp.keys()` (meaning `i` is not in `arr`).
- It finds an `i` that has appeared exactly once in `arr` and `first` is already `True` (meaning we've already encountered another integer that appeared exactly once).
- It completes all iterations without breaking out of the loop.

Let's determine the final state:
- `i` will be `n` after the loop completes all iterations (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`).
- `first` will be `True` if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once, otherwise it will remain `False`.
- `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **i is n, first is True if there is at least one integer in arr that appears exactly once, otherwise False, n is unchanged, arr is unchanged, mpp is unchanged.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `first` will be `True` if there is at least one integer in the list `arr` that appears exactly once, and `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` will remain the same as they were initially.
