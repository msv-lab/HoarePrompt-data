The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

The condition `if mpp[i] == 1 and first is True` does not affect the loop's control variables `i` and `n`. It only affects the flow within the loop body, which does not impact the loop's continuation condition.

So, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i`**
