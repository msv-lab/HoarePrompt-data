### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the function summary and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` to form array `c` and then delete the chosen element from `a`.
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `a` and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` to find the smallest number that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code logic:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining MEX**: The code does not correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c`. It incorrectly assumes that the first missing number after encountering a number with a single occurrence is the MEX. This assumption does not account for the optimal strategies of both players.
2. **Handling of Element Frequencies**: The code does not handle the case where multiple elements have the same frequency or when the optimal strategy involves more complex interactions between Alice and Bob's moves.
3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The code does not implement the optimal strategy for both players. It simply checks for the first missing number based on the frequency of elements, which is not sufficient to determine the MEX after both players have played optimally.

#### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the provided code does not correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c` when both players play optimally. The function summary does not align with the optimal strategy required for the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the code is:

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the code does not implement the optimal strategy and does not correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c`.
