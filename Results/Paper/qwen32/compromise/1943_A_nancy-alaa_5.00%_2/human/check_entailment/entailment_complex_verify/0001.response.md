### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand why the original assessment is correct and the program is indeed incorrect.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
- The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Key Observations:
- Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning they make the best possible move at each step.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array.
- The optimal strategy involves understanding the frequency of each element and how they can be used to maximize/minimize the MEX.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. It then attempts to find the smallest integer that either does not appear in the array or appears exactly once. However, this approach does not correctly determine the MEX after both players have played optimally.

Here's the annotated code with detailed reasoning:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
```

- **Issue 1: Incorrect Logic for Determining MEX**:
  - The code checks if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, which correctly identifies the smallest missing number.
  - However, the condition `if mpp[i] == 1 and first` is incorrect. It does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple elements have the same frequency or when the optimal strategy involves more complex interactions between Alice and Bob's moves.
  
- **Issue 2: Handling of Element Frequencies**:
  - The code does not correctly handle the case where multiple elements have the same frequency or when the optimal strategy involves more complex interactions between Alice and Bob's moves.
  - The variable `first` is used incorrectly to determine the MEX, as it does not account for the optimal moves of both players.

- **Issue 3: Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
  - The code does not implement the optimal strategy for both players. It simply checks for the first missing number based on the frequency of elements, which is not sufficient to determine the MEX after both players have played optimally.

#### Correct Approach:
- To determine the MEX after both players have played optimally, we need to simulate the game.
- Alice will try to maximize the MEX by picking elements that do not appear in `c` or appear an odd number of times.
- Bob will try to minimize the MEX by picking elements that appear an even number of times or do not affect the MEX.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly determine the MEX after both players have played optimally. It incorrectly assumes that the first missing number after encountering a number with a single occurrence is the MEX. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
