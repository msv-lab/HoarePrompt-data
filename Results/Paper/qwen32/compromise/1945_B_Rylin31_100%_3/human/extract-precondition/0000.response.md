Precondition: **The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function receives three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18) where a and b are the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and m is the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky after launch.**
