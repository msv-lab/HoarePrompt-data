Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` where `a` and `b` are the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and `m` is the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky after launch. The function returns the total number of distinct moments in time during the duration `m` when at least one firework is visible in the sky for each test case.**
