### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to see if it correctly computes the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Vertices and Diagonals**: The vertices of the cake are numbered from 1 to n in a clockwise manner. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, and you can choose up to `y` additional vertices. The goal is to form non-intersecting diagonals using these vertices to maximize the number of triangular pieces.
2. **Triangular Pieces**: A triangular piece is formed when three vertices are connected by diagonals such that no other vertices are inside the triangle.
3. **Constraints**: The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), which is manageable for computation.

#### Solution Breakdown:
1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` vertices.
2. **Sorting**: The list of chosen vertices is sorted.
3. **Initial Calculation**: The initial value of `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This accounts for the fact that with `x` vertices and `y` additional vertices, you can form at least `x + y - 2` triangles.
4. **Gap Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted list of vertices to find gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is 2, it adds 1 to `ans` because you can form an additional triangle.
   - If the gap is greater than 2 and even, it records half the gap in a list `tmp`.
   - It also checks the gap between the first and last chosen vertices, considering the polygon's wrap-around.
5. **Greedy Selection**:
   - The list `tmp` is sorted.
   - The function iteratively selects gaps from `tmp` and adds the corresponding number of triangles to `ans` while decrementing `y` by the number of additional vertices used.
   - If `y` is insufficient to fill a gap, the process stops.
6. **Final Adjustment**: The function ensures that `ans` does not exceed `n - 2`, the maximum possible number of triangles in a polygon with `n` vertices.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Initial Calculation**: The initial value `x + y - 2` is a reasonable starting point because it accounts for the basic connectivity of the chosen vertices.
- **Gap Analysis**: The logic for handling gaps of 2 and even gaps seems correct. Gaps of 2 directly add a triangle, while larger gaps can be filled with additional vertices to form more triangles.
- **Greedy Selection**: The greedy approach of selecting the smallest gaps first to maximize the number of triangles is sound.
- **Final Adjustment**: Ensuring `ans` does not exceed `n - 2` is necessary to respect the maximum number of triangles possible in a polygon.

Based on this analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
