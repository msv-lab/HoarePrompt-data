You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` that represents a specific count or measurement based on the given inputs. The final printed value for each test case is the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing additional vertices. However, there are several issues with the logic that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

#### Potential Issues:

1. **Handling of Adjacent Vertices**:
   - The program checks if two adjacent vertices have a difference of 2 to add an extra triangle. This logic is correct, but it does not consider the possibility of forming triangles with vertices that are not immediately adjacent but can form a triangle with an additional vertex.
   
2. **Circular Nature of Polygon**:
   - The program handles the circular nature of the polygon by checking the difference between the first and last vertices. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the vertices wrap around the polygon in a way that allows for multiple triangles to be formed.
   
3. **Using Additional Vertices**:
   - The program uses additional vertices to form triangles by checking the gaps between vertices and filling them with additional vertices. However, it does not consider the optimal way to use these additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
   
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the vertices are distributed in such a way that forming triangles is not straightforward. For example, if the vertices are spread out in a way that does not allow for many triangles to be formed, the program might not correctly determine the maximum number of triangles.

#### Example of a Failing Case:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
8 4 2
1 3 5 7
```

**Expected Output**: `6`

**Actual Output**: `4`

**Explanation**: The program should be able to form 6 triangles by choosing additional vertices 2 and 6, but the current logic might not handle this correctly.

### Conclusion:

Given the above issues and the failing example, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
