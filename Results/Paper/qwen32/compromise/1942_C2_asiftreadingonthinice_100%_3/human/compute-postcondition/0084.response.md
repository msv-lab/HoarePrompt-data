Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is even, `tmp` contains all values `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` where the difference is even and not 2, plus `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` contains all values `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` where the difference is even and not 2. `y` is the third input integer, `ii` is 4, `tt` is greater than 4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2.**
