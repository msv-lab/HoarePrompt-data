The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `tt`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `ii` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`tt` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `ii` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and sorted in ascending order.**
