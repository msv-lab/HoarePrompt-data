The code snippet provided is `y -= i - 1`. This line will subtract `i - 1` from the current value of `y`. 

Given the initial state, `y` is described as the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`, and `y` is also less than `i - 1`. After the execution of the code snippet, the new value of `y` will be the previous value of `y` minus `i - 1`.

Since the specific value of `i` is not provided, we can only express the new value of `y` in terms of the previous value of `y` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp` minus `i - 1`, `ans` is adjusted based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and incremented by `i`, `ii` is incremented by `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two elements such that `a[1] - a[0]` is even and not equal to 2, and `tmp` includes `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. `tmp` is sorted in ascending order. Additionally, `y` is less than `i - 1`.**
