The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `tt`, `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this code snippet. The loop variable `ii` is also not affected as it is initialized to 0 and the code does not modify it.

Output State: **`tt` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `ii` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
