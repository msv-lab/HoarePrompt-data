The given code snippet initializes an empty list `tmp`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `ans`, `ii`, `tt`, or `a`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `tmp` is an empty list**.
