Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, `tmp` contains at least one element, `y` is the third input integer, `ii` is 4, `tt` is greater than 4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input such that `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, and `y` is less than `ii - 1`**
