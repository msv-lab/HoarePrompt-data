Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`, `ans` is adjusted based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `ii` is incremented by `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, and `tmp` includes `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2. Additionally, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even.**
