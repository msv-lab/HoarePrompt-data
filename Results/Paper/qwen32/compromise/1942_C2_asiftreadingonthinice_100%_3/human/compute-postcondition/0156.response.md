Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are input integers, `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp` up to the current `i`. If `y >= i - 1`, `y` is further decreased by `i - 1` and `ans` is adjusted by adding `tmp[j+1]`. If `y < i - 1`, `y` remains as is and `ans` is not adjusted by `tmp[j+1]`. `ii` is incremented by `len(a) - 1` in both cases, `tt` remains unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two elements such that `a[1] - a[0]` is even and not equal to 2, and `tmp` includes `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. `tmp` is sorted in ascending order, and `i` is `tmp[j+1]`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `y < i - 1`.**
