To determine the output of the `print(res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`t`**: This is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000. However, the value of `t` is not directly used in the `print(res)` statement, so it doesn't affect the output.

2. **`n`**: This is another input integer. The exact value of `n` is not specified, but it's important because it will be used to construct the list `a`.

3. **`a`**: This is a list of integers with all trailing 0s removed. The list `a` is derived from some input, but the exact elements are not specified. However, it is known that any trailing zeros have been removed from the original list.

4. **`res`**: This variable holds the count of zeros in the list `a`. Since `a` has all trailing zeros removed, `res` can only be 0 because any trailing zeros would have been eliminated.

Given this information, the value of `res` is 0 because the list `a` has no trailing zeros, and the count of zeros in a list with no zeros is 0.

Therefore, the output of the `print(res)` statement is:

Output: **0**
