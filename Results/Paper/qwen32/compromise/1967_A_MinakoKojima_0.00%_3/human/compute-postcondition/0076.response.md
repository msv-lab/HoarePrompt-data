The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration.
- `a` is the list after all updates.
- `m` is the minimum value in the final updated list `a`.
- `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and since the loop is `for i in range(1, n)`, `i` must have been incremented from its previous value. To start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration, `a` is the list after all updates, `m` is the minimum value in the final updated list `a`, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration, `a` is the list after all updates, `m` is the minimum value in the final updated list `a`, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `a`, `i` is `x + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration, `a` is the list after all updates, `m` is the minimum value in the final updated list `a`, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

If we assume `i` was 1 at the end of the first iteration (since the loop starts from 1), then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration, `a` is the list after all updates, `m` is the minimum value in the final updated list `a`, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `a`, `i` is 2**.

So the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration, `a` is the list after all updates, `m` is the minimum value in the final updated list `a`, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

For the sake of concreteness in the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration, `a` is the list after all updates, `m` is the minimum value in the final updated list `a`, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `a`, `i` is 2**.
