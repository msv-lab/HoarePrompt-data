The given Python code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `m`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0.**
