The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0.
- `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is the loop variable.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on a value such that the loop has executed for that `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound for the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1**.
