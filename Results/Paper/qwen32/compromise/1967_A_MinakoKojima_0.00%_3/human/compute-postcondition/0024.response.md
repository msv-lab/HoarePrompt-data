To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the given information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
- `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its current value. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

Let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `n` remains the same as it is the loop's upper bound and does not change during the loop iterations.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, the state at the start of the next iteration would have `i` already incremented by 1 from the previous iteration's end state. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is set to the correct value for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans` is `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`**.

However, to be more precise for the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `ans` is `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])` from the previous iteration**.

Since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head (`i` and `n`), and `n` remains unchanged:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`**.

So the final adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

To be explicit about the increment:
If at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` should be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, we can write:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

Simplifying, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

So the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`**.

To make it clear:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`**.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`**.
