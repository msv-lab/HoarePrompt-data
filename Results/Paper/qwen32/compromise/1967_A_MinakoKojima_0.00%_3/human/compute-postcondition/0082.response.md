To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\).
   - `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `ans` is determined based on the condition:
     - If \(k \geq n \times m\), `ans` is the factorial of `n`.
     - Otherwise, `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration, and `ans` is calculated as the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the product of \((a[i] - a[i-1])\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).

2. **Steps to Determine `ans`:**
   - **Case 1: \(k \geq n \times m\)**:
     - `ans` is the factorial of `n`.
     - The factorial of `n` is the product of all positive integers from 1 to `n`.
   - **Case 2: \(k < n \times m\)**:
     - `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration.
     - `a` is the list after all updates.
     - `m` is the minimum value in the final updated list `a`.
     - `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the product of \((a[i] - a[i-1])\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).

Given the initial state, we don't have specific values for `n`, `k`, and the list `a`. Therefore, we need to describe `ans` based on the conditions provided:

- If \(k \geq n \times m\), `ans` is the factorial of `n`.
- If \(k < n \times m\), `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the product of \((a[i] - a[i-1])\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).

Since we don't have the specific values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` based on the conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the factorial of n if k >= n * m, otherwise ans is the first element of the list a multiplied by the product of (a[i] - a[i-1]) for all i from 1 to n-1)**
