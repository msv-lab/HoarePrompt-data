Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a value based on these inputs for each test case. Specifically, Case_1: If a certain condition related to `n`, `k`, and the list `a` is met, it returns a specific result; Case_2: If the condition is not met, it returns a different result.**
