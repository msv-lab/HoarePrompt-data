You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the array, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: ntest remains unchanged and all test cases have been processed, with the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each list printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of an array, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases. The function returns the result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
