### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any way. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Given the definition of beauty, the maximum beauty is actually the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. This is because, in an optimally arranged array, the maximum beauty is achieved by placing the smallest element first and the largest element last, which results in the maximum possible difference between the first and last elements. All other intermediate differences will be zero or negative if we only consider the first and last elements.

The provided code reads multiple test cases, sorts each array, and then prints the difference between the last (maximum) and the first (minimum) elements of the sorted array. This approach correctly computes the maximum beauty as described.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum beauty for each test case by sorting the array and computing the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
