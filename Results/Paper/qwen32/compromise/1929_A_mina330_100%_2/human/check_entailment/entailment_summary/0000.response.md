Reasoning:  
The given problem requires us to determine the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any way. To maximize this sum, the optimal arrangement is to sort the array in ascending order. This way, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, and the beauty of the array is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted array.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by sorting the array and then printing the difference between the last (maximum) and first (minimum) elements of the sorted array. This approach ensures that we achieve the maximum possible beauty for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
