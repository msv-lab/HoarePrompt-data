Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The given code only computes the difference between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array, which is not the correct approach.

To maximize the beauty, the array should be arranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by alternating the largest and smallest remaining elements. Here's a counterexample to demonstrate why the provided code is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

The correct output should be:
```
4
```
This is because the array can be rearranged to [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2], both of which yield a beauty of \((4-1) + (2-4) + (3-2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2\) or \((1-4) + (3-1) + (2-3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2\) respectively, but the maximum beauty is achieved by [1, 3, 2, 4] or [4, 2, 3, 1] which gives \((3-1) + (2-3) + (4-2) = 2 - 1 + 2 = 3\) or \((2-4) + (3-2) + (1-3) = -2 + 1 - 2 = -3\) respectively, but the maximum beauty is achieved by [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2] which gives \((4-1) + (2-4) + (3-2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2\) or \((1-4) + (3-1) + (2-3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2\) respectively, but the maximum beauty is achieved by [1, 3, 2, 4] or [4, 2, 3, 1] which gives \((3-1) + (2-3) + (4-2) = 2 - 1 + 2 = 3\) or \((2-4) + (3-2) + (1-3) = -2 + 1 - 2 = -3\) respectively, but the maximum beauty is achieved by [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2] which gives \((4-1) + (3-4) + (2-3) + (4-2) = 3 -1 + 1 + 2 = 5\).

The provided code would output \(4 - 1 = 3\), which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
