Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array, but this does not necessarily give the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, not just the difference between the max and min elements.

To achieve the maximum beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. The beauty is then the sum of the positive differences between consecutive elements in this sorted array.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            beauty += a[i] - a[i - 1]
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
