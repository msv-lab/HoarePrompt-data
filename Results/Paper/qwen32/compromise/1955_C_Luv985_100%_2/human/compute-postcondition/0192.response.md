Postcondition: **`T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0 and has been updated to `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[l]` has been updated to `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` has been updated to `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `r` must be at least `l + 1`. If `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1.**
