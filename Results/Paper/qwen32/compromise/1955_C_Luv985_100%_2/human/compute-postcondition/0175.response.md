Output State: **`T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0 minus `mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi` and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, `l` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `l` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
