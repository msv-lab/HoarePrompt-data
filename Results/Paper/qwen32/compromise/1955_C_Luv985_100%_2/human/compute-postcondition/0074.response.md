Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0 but is now `T - 1`, `t` (possibly modified), `n` is the first part of the input split by space converted to an integer, `k` is the second part of the input split by space converted to an integer, `a` (with some elements potentially 0), `l` (first non-zero index), `r` (last non-zero index), `ans` (count of fully consumed elements)**

In natural language: The value of `k` has been converted from a string to an integer. All other variables retain their previous states.
