Postcondition: **`T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` must be at least 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is reduced by `mi` and `a[n - 1]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[l]` is 0 (where `l` is 0), `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `mi` is the minimum of the original `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. Additionally, `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. `k` is now `k - mi * 2`.**
