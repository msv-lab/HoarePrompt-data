The code snippet `n = int(n)` converts the variable `n`, which is the first part of the input split by space, into an integer.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0 but is now `T - 1`, `t` (possibly modified), `n` is the first part of the input split by space converted to an integer, `k` is the second part of the input split by space, `a` (with some elements potentially 0), `l` (first non-zero index), `r` (last non-zero index), `ans` (count of fully consumed elements)**

In simpler terms, the variable `n` has been converted to an integer, while all other variables remain unchanged.
