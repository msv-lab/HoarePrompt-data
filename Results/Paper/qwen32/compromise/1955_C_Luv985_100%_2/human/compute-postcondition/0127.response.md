Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0 but now `T - 1`. `t` is either `k % 2` (if `mi * 2 > k`) or modified in the if part. `n` is greater than 1. `k` is greater than `mi * 2` and now `k - mi * 2`. `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces. Elements at indices `l` and `r` are modified based on the if or else conditions. If `a[r]` was 0, `r` is now `r - 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `l` is now `l + 1` if `a[l]` was 0, `mi` is `min(a[l - 1], a[r])` before the increment, `a[l - 1]` is now `a[l - 1] - mi`, and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`. Otherwise, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are modified based on the else conditions.**
