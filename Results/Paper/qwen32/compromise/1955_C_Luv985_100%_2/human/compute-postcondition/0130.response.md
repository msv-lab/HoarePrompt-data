Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0 but is now `T - 1`, `t` is `k % 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than `mi * 2`, `a` is the new list from the input split by spaces with all elements converted to integers, elements at indices `l` and `r` are modified based on the if or else conditions, `l` is less than `r`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
