Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0 but is now `T - 1`, `t` is modified (either `k % 2` in the else part or possibly modified in the if part), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 and is now `k - mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`; otherwise, `k` remains unchanged, `a` is the new list from the input split by spaces with all elements converted to integers, and elements at indices `l` and `r` are modified based on the if or else conditions, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` unless modified in the if part, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `ans` is determined based on the if or else conditions: if `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 1 or 2 depending on specific conditions; otherwise, `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0.**
