Postcondition: **`T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `r` must be at least `l + 1`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, and if `a[l]` or `a[r]` becomes 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `l` or `r` is adjusted accordingly. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1 and the loop or statement is broken out of.**
