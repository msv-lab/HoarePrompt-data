Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the conditions. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2` and `ans` is set to 1 if `a[l]` is not 0, otherwise `ans` is set to 2. If `a[r]` is not 0, `r` remains `n - 1` and `ans` remains 0 if `a[l]` is not 0, otherwise `ans` is set to 1. If `a[l]` is 0, it remains 0. `l` is set to 0 if `a[l]` is not 0, otherwise `l` is set to 1. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then `ans` is set to 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` is equal to 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 or `t` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 (decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`), `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` and `a[r]` may have been adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the conditions. If `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is increased by 1 and `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` becomes 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 or `t` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is updated (`k - mi * 2` in the if part, remains the same in the else part), `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` and `a[r]` may have been adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is 0 unless `a[l] == 0` in which case `l` is set to 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the conditions, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[r] == 0` or `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before any adjustments.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
