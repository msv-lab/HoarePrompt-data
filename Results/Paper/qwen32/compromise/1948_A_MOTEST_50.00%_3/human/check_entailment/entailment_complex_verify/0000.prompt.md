You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.

    s = string.ascii_uppercase

        n = int(input())

                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that t is greater than or equal to 1; n is an input integer (from the last iteration); s is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; i is equal to t; if n is 1, the program prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and ans is set to the constructed string based on n (e.g., "AABBCC" if n is 6), and x is set to the corresponding value (e.g., 3 if n is 6).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n`. For each test case, if `n` is 1, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by a constructed string of length `n` using uppercase letters from the alphabet, ensuring that the string is balanced with pairs of letters. If `n` is odd, the string starts with "AAA" followed by pairs of letters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
You are given an integer `n`. Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be exactly `n` special characters in this string. A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it constructs a string based on the value of `n`. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Logic for Constructing the String:**
   - If `n == 1`, the program outputs `NO` because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of uppercase Latin letters.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of distinct uppercase letters. For example, for `n = 6`, it constructs a string like `AABBCC`.
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts with `AAA` and then repeats pairs of distinct uppercase letters. For example, for `n = 5`, it constructs a string like `AAABB`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs `YES` followed by the constructed string if a valid string can be formed.
   - It outputs `NO` if `n == 1`.

### Edge Cases and Correctness Verification:
- **Case 1 (`n == 1`):** The program correctly outputs `NO` because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- **Case 2 (`n` is even):** The program constructs a string with `n` special characters. For example, for `n = 6`, the string `AABBCC` has 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- **Case 3 (`n` is odd):** The program constructs a string with `n` special characters. For example, for `n = 5`, the string `AAABB` has 5 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided example input:
```
3
6
1
2
```
- **Test Case 1 (`n = 6`):** The program outputs `YES` followed by `AABBCC`, which is correct.
- **Test Case 2 (`n = 1`):** The program outputs `NO`, which is correct.
- **Test Case 3 (`n = 2`):** The program outputs `YES` followed by `AABB`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all edge cases and correctly constructs strings with the required number of special characters. There are no apparent issues with the logic or output.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description. It outputs `NO` for `n = 1` and constructs valid strings with exactly `n` special characters for all other values of `n`.
