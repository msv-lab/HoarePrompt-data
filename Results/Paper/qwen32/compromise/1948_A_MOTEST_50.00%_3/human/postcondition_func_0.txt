The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n`. For each test case, if `n` is 1, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by a constructed string of length `n` using uppercase letters from the alphabet, ensuring that the string is balanced with pairs of letters. If `n` is odd, the string starts with "AAA" followed by pairs of letters.
