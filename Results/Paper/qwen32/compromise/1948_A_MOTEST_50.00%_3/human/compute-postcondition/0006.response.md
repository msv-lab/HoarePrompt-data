In the given initial state, we have the following:

- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an input integer and its current value is 1.
- `s` is the string "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement explicitly outputs the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
