The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` repeated twice to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 3 and `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", the character at index 3 is 'D'. Therefore, 'DD' is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is not divisible by 2 and `n` is at least 7; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is `'AAABBCCDD'`; `x` is 3; `j` is 2**.
