The given task involves an initial state with several variables defined and a simple `print` statement. Let's break down the information provided:

- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is either 6 or 7.
- `s` is the string "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".
- `i` is set to 2.
- Depending on the value of `n`:
  - If `n` is 6, `x` is 3 and `ans` is "AABBCC".
  - If `n` is 7, `x` is 4 and `ans` is "AAABBCCDD".

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `x`, or `ans`. It simply prints the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
