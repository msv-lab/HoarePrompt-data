The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends two characters from the string `s` to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 2, `s[x]` refers to the third character in the string `s`, which is "C". Therefore, "CC" is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is 6, `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", `ans` is "AABBCC", `x` is 2, `j` is 2**.
