The value of `x` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `x` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only state that `x` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", `i` is 2, `ans` is "AA", `x` is increased by 1.**
