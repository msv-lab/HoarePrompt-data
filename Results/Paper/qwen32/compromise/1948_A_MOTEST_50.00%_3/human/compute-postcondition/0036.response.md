Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ". If `n` is 1, the program does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. Otherwise, if `n` is not 1, `s` remains unchanged, and if `n` is even, `ans` is set to "AABBCC", `x` is set to 3, and `j` is set to 2. If `n` is not 1 and is odd, `ans` is set to "AAABBBCCDDEE" and `x` is set to 5.**
