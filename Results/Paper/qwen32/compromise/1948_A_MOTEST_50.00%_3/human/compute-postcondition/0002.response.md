The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. The value of `n` and the string `s` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (1 <= t <= 50), `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"**.
