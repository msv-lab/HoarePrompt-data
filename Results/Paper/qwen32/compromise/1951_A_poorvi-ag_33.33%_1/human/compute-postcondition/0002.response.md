The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `start`, `end`, and `results` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list**
