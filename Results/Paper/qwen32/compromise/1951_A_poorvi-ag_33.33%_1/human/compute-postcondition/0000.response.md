`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The precondition that `start <= end` is still valid after the code has been executed. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer.**
