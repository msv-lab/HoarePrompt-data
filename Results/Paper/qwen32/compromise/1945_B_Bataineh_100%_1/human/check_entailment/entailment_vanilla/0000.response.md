Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. Fireworks from two installations are launched at intervals `a` and `b` respectively, and each firework remains visible for `m+1` minutes after its launch.

### Key Points:
1. **Launch Times:**
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times `a, 2a, 3a, ...`.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times `b, 2b, 3b, ...`.

2. **Visibility:**
   - A firework launched at time `x` is visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.
   - If two fireworks are launched `m` minutes apart, they will be visible for one minute together.

3. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the given program and see if it correctly addresses the problem:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a and m < b:
            print(2)
        elif m < a and m > b:
            print(2 + m // b)
        elif m < b and m > a:
            print(2 + m // a)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

### Evaluation:
1. **Condition `m < a and m < b`:**
   - If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, it means that no fireworks from either installation can overlap with another from the same installation within their visibility period. Thus, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2 (one from each installation).

2. **Condition `m < a and m > b`:**
   - If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, fireworks from the second installation can overlap with each other within their visibility period. The number of fireworks from the second installation visible at any time can be calculated as `m // b + 1`. Adding the one firework from the first installation, the total is `2 + m // b`.

3. **Condition `m < b and m > a`:**
   - This is symmetric to the previous case, where fireworks from the first installation can overlap with each other. The number of fireworks from the first installation visible at any time is `m // a + 1`. Adding the one firework from the second installation, the total is `2 + m // a`.

4. **Else Condition:**
   - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, fireworks from both installations can overlap with each other. The number of fireworks from the first installation visible at any time is `m // a + 1`, and from the second installation is `m // b + 1`. Adding these together and subtracting the overlap (which is at least 2 due to the simultaneous launches), we get `m // a + m // b + 2`.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle all cases correctly based on the given conditions. However, there are some edge cases and logical errors that need to be considered:
- The overlap logic in the else condition is not fully correct. It does not account for the exact overlap of fireworks from both installations.
- The conditions for `m < a and m > b` and `m < b and m > a` assume that fireworks from one installation can overlap with itself, which is not always true.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and logical scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
