Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time based on the given problem description. The logic in the provided code does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations over time.

Let's consider a detailed breakdown of the problem and the provided solution:

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. This involves considering the overlap of intervals where fireworks from both installations are visible. The formula to calculate the number of fireworks visible from each installation is straightforward: `m // a + 1` for the first installation and `m // b + 1` for the second installation. Here, `m // a` gives the number of additional fireworks launched within the visibility period `m` from the first installation, and `+1` includes the initial firework. The same logic applies to the second installation.

However, we also need to account for the fireworks that are visible at the same time due to overlaps. The overlap can be calculated using the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. The number of overlapping fireworks is given by `m // lcm(a, b) + 1`.

The provided code does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it uses a series of conditionals that do not accurately reflect the overlap of fireworks. Here are some specific issues:

1. The conditions `if m < a and m < b`, `elif m < a and m > b`, and `elif m < b and m > a` are incorrect. They do not account for the actual overlap of fireworks.
2. The `else` condition `print(m // a + m // b + 2)` is also incorrect because it does not subtract the overlapping fireworks.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = abs(a*b) // math.gcd(a, b)  # Calculate the least common multiple of a and b
        fireworks_a = m // a + 1
        fireworks_b = m // b + 1
        overlap = m // lcm_ab + 1
        max_fireworks = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - overlap
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected code calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation and subtracts the overlapping fireworks to get the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

Since the provided code does not correctly handle the overlap of fireworks, it is incorrect.
