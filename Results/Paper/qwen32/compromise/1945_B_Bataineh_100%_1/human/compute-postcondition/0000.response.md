The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After executing this line, `t` will be updated to the value provided by the input, but it will still adhere to the precondition that it is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18.**
