The code snippet creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in the string `r` is mapped to the character at the mirrored position from the end of `r`. Specifically, the character at index `i` in `r` is mapped to the character at index `-(i + 1)` in `r`.

Given that `r` contains the unique characters from all strings in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order, the `mapping` dictionary will map each character to its corresponding character from the end of `r`.

For example, if `r` is "abcde", then `mapping` will be:
- 'a' -> 'e'
- 'b' -> 'd'
- 'c' -> 'c'
- 'd' -> 'b'
- 'e' -> 'a'

Thus, the `encoded` list and its properties remain unchanged, and the `r` string also remains unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `mapping`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n over the tuples does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `r` is a string containing the unique characters from all strings in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order; `mapping` is a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to the character at the mirrored position from the end of `r`.**
