Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it performs encoding instead of decoding. The function `func_1` creates a mapping that maps each character in the string `r` to its symmetric character, which is used to encode the original string `s` into `b`. However, the task requires the reverse operation: decoding the string `b` back into the original string `s`.

To correct the program, you need to reverse the mapping so that each character in `r` maps to its corresponding original character. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[-(i + 1)]: r[i] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))
```

With this change, the program will correctly decode the encoded string `b` back into the original string `s`.
