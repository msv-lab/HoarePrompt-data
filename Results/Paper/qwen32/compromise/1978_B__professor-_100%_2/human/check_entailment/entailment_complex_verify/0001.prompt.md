You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
        
    #State: The output state is a sequence of integers, each representing the total cost for the corresponding test case, printed one per line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). For each test case, it calculates and prints the total cost of selling the buns, considering that the first bun is sold at the modified price `b`, and the remaining `n-1` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns under the given promotion rules.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Promotion:**
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \)).
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at decreasing prices from \( b \) down to \( b - k + 1 \).
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum profit Bob can earn by choosing an optimal \( k \).

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It then calculates the maximum profit based on the following conditions:
     - If \( b \le a \): It means the modified price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
     - If \( b - a \ge n \): It implies that selling the first \( n \) buns at the modified price is the best option. The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1 can be calculated using the formula \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2} \).
     - Otherwise, it calculates the profit by selling the first \( b - a \) buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price \( a \).

4. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** \( b \le a \) is correctly handled by selling all buns at the usual price.
   - **Condition 2:** \( b - a \ge n \) correctly calculates the maximum profit by selling all buns at the modified price.
   - **Else Case:** Correctly calculates the profit by selling the first \( b - a \) buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price.

5. **Testing with Examples:**
   - For the test case `4 4 5`:
     - \( b - a = 1 \), which is less than \( n \), so it calculates the profit as \( 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \).
   - For the test case `5 5 9`:
     - \( b - a = 4 \), which is less than \( n \), so it calculates the profit as \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \).
   - For the test case `10 10 5`:
     - \( b \le a \), so it calculates the profit as \( 10 \cdot 10 = 100 \).
   - For the test case `5 5 11`:
     - \( b - a = 6 \), which is greater than \( n \), so it calculates the profit as \( \frac{(2 \cdot 11 - 5 + 1) \cdot 5}{2} = 45 \).
   - For the test cases with \( n \) and \( a \) and \( b \) all equal to \( 10^9 \):
     - \( b - a = 0 \), so it calculates the profit as \( 10^9 \cdot 10^9 = 10^{18} \).
   - For the test case `1000 1 1000`:
     - \( b - a = 999 \), which is greater than \( n \), so it calculates the profit as \( \frac{(2 \cdot 1000 - 1000 + 1) \cdot 1000}{2} = 500500 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all given conditions and calculates the maximum profit for each test case accurately.
