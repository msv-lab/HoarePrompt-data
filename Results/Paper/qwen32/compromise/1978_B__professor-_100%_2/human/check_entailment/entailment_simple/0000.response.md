### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can make by selling buns under specific promotional pricing rules. The key is to decide how many buns (denoted as `k`) to sell at the modified price and how many to sell at the usual price.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **If `b <= a`:**
   - Selling the buns at the usual price `a` will yield a higher or equal profit compared to the modified price `b` for the first `k` buns. Hence, the optimal strategy is to sell all `n` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The formula used is `n * a`.

2. **If `b - a >= n`:**
   - If the difference between the modified price of the first bun and the usual price is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it's more profitable to sell all buns at the modified price.
   - The sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each step is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series.

3. **Otherwise (`b - a < n`):**
   - Selling the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit.
   - The sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each step is:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - Adding the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price `a`:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \text{Sum} + a \times (n - (b - a))
     \]
   - Simplifying, the formula used is:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n
     \]

### Verification with Test Cases:

Let's verify the logic with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1: `4 4 5`**
   - `b > a` and `b - a < n` → `k = b - a = 1`
   - Profit = `5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17`
   - Formula: `(5 - 4) * (5 - 4 + 1) // 2 + 4 * 4 = 17`

2. **Test Case 2: `5 5 9`**
   - `b > a` and `b - a >= n` → `k = n = 5`
   - Profit = `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`
   - Formula: `(2 * 9 - 5 + 1) * 5 // 2 = 35`

3. **Test Case 3: `10 10 5`**
   - `b <= a` → `k = 0`
   - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
   - Formula: `10 * 10 = 100`

4. **Test Case 4: `5 5 11`**
   - `b > a` and `b - a >= n` → `k = n = 5`
   - Profit = `11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45`
   - Formula: `(2 * 11 - 5 + 1) * 5 // 2 = 45`

5. **Test Case 5: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`**
   - `b <= a` → `k = 0`
   - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000`
   - Formula: `1000000000 * 1000000000`

6. **Test Case 6: `1000000000 1000000000 1`**
   - `b <= a` → `k = 0`
   - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000`
   - Formula: `1000000000 * 1000000000`

7. **Test Case 7: `1000 1 1000`**
   - `b > a` and `b - a >= n` → `k = n = 1000`
   - Profit = `1000 + 999 + ... + 1`
   - Formula: `(2 * 1000 - 1000 + 1) * 1000 // 2 = 500500`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described above and produces the correct output for all provided test cases.
