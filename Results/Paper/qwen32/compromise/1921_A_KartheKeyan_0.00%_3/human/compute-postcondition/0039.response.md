Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is 0, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]))`, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

The value of `n` has been decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
