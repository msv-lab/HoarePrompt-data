Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero integer, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input, `i` is 3**.

The `coord` list now contains three tuples, each representing coordinates `(x, y)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.
