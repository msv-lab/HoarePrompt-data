The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Therefore, the only variable that changes is `coord`, which now includes the new tuple. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero integer, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input, `i` is 4.**
