To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement.

Given State:
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)
- `n` is 1
- `coord` is []
- `res` is 0
- `i` is 3
- `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`
- `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`

For Loop:
```python
for i in range(4):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range function generates a sequence of numbers that the loop variable `i` can iterate over. The range function `range(4)` generates the sequence `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `i` starts from 0 and increments up to 3.

In the given state, `i` is initially set to 3, which means that if the loop were to start with this value, it would not execute because the loop expects `i` to start from 0.

The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `i`. We need to set `i` to 0 before the loop starts to ensure that the loop executes as intended.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is 1, `coord` is [], `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Note: The values of `p1` and `p2` depend on `coord`, which is an empty list. Therefore, these values are undefined and will raise an error if accessed. However, since the task specifies only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, we do not need to modify `p1` and `p2` in this context.
