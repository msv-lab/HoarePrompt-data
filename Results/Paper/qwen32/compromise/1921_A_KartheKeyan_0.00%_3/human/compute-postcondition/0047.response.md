Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero value, `coord` is a list with at least 5 elements (the original 4 elements plus the new tuple `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are the input integers), `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer`.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` have been updated to the integers provided by the user input, and the `coord` list now includes the new tuple `(x, y)` as its fifth element. All other variables retain their initial values.
