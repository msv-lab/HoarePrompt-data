Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is 1, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`**

In this output state, all variables except `p2` remain unchanged. The variable `p2` is now calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the fourth and third points in the `coord` list.
