The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The variables `t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The variable `coord` now includes the newly appended tuple.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100), `n` is 1, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `p1` is undefined, `p2` is undefined, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.**
