The code snippet provided initializes a variable `res` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `x_i`, `y_i`, `n`, and `coord`) are mentioned in the initial state but not modified by the given code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is 0.**
