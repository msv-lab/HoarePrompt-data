Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero integer minus 1, `coord` is the sorted list of tuples [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)], `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

In simpler terms, the value of `n` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
