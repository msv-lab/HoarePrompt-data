The provided code snippet is simply initializing an empty list named `coord`. This action does not affect the values of `t` or the coordinates `x_i`, `y_i` for any test case. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `coord`.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is an empty list.**
