Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is initialized to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
