The value of `k` is set to 0, overwriting its previous value of either `b` or `j + 1`. The values of `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `b` and `c` are the integers obtained from the input; `d` is the value obtained from the input; `e` is the value obtained from the input.

Output State: **`k` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `b` and `c` are the integers obtained from the input; `d` is the value obtained from the input; `e` is the value obtained from the input.**
