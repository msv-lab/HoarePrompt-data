Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; `j` is 5; `k` is the position of `d[5]` in the substring `e[5:]` plus 5. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `k` is set to 6. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
