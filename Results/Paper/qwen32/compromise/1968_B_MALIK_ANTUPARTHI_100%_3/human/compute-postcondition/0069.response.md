The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and `a` is the upper bound of the loop. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to its next value. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, we can deduce that at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `k` is `j + 1` where `j` is the iteration number at which the loop breaks.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

Let's assume that the loop did not break in the previous iteration (otherwise, `k` would have been set to `j + 1` and the loop would not continue). Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.

State: **`k` is `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `k` is `j + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` remains the same**.

Since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, and `a` is not being modified, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`k` is `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `k` is `j + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, to provide a more concrete example, let's assume specific values:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.
- The loop will continue as long as `i < a`.

Then, at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`k` is `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `k` is `j + 1`, `i` is 3, `a` remains the same**.

Since `a` is not part of the loop head that we need to adjust, we can omit it in the final state:
State: **`k` is `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `k` is `j + 1`, `i` is 3**
