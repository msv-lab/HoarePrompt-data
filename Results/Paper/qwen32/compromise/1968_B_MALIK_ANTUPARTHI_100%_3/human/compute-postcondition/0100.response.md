Postcondition: **`k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[5]) + 1 + k` if `d[5]` is in `e[k:]`, otherwise `k` is set to 5. `i` remains 3, `b` remains greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the input string, `e` is the next input from the user, `j` is 5. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
