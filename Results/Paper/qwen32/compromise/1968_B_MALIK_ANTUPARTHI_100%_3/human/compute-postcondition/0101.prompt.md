Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is 0; `i` is 3; `b` is the first integer from the input; `c` is the second integer from the input; `d` is the input string; `e` is the next input from the user.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is 0, `i` is 3, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the input string, `e` is the next input from the user. If the character at index `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`, then `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`. Additionally, if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to `j + 1`. Otherwise, if the character `d[j]` is not present in the substring `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is set to `e[0:].index(d[4]) + 1` if `d[4]` is in `e[k:]`, otherwise `k` is set to 4. `i` remains 3, `b` remains greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the input string, `e` is the next input from the user, `j` remains 4. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `k == c` or `j == b - 1` when `d[4]` is in `e[k:]`, or unconditionally when `d[4]` is not in `e[k:]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[5]) + 1 + k` if `d[5]` is in `e[k:]`, otherwise `k` is set to 5. `i` remains 3, `b` remains greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the input string, `e` is the next input from the user, `j` is 5. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
