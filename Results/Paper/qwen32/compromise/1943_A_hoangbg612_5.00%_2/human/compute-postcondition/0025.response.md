Postcondition: **`num` is the next element in the list `N`, `cur` is an integer, and `M` is a dictionary. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M` is updated to have `cur` as a key with a value of `1`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is further incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `num` is not greater than `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
