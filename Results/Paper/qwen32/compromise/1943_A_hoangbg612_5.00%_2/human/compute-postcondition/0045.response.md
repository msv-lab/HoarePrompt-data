Output State: **`cur` is now equal to `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, `cur` holds the value that `i` had before it was incremented. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
