To determine what will be printed by the `print(cur)` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

1. **`cur` is defined as the smallest index `i` for which `M[i] <= i`.**
   - This means `cur` is set to the smallest index `i` in the list `M` where the element at that index is less than or equal to the index itself.
   
2. **If no such `i` is found within the range, `cur` retains its initial value.**
   - This implies that if no index `i` satisfies `M[i] <= i`, `cur` will not be updated from its initial value.

Since the initial value of `cur` is not explicitly mentioned in the precondition, we can assume `cur` has some default value before this logic is applied. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `cur` is initialized to some value, say `-1`, which is a common default for such indices if no valid index is found.

Given this, there are two possible outcomes:
- If there exists an index `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, then `cur` will be set to that smallest `i`.
- If no such index `i` exists, `cur` will retain its initial value (e.g., `-1`).

Since the exact list `M` and its elements are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `cur`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `cur` as determined by the given logic.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **cur (where cur is the smallest index i for which M[i] <= i, or the initial value of cur if no such i is found)**
