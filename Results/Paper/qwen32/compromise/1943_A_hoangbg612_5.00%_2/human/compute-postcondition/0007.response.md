To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop statement and the provided state. The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `N`. 

Given:
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `S` is an input integer.
- `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `cur` is -1.
- `M` is an empty dictionary.

The loop statement:
```
for num in N:
    # the loop body is omit
```

**Analysis:**
- The loop will execute if `N` contains at least one element. 
- Only the state of `N` can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes, as the loop head only involves `num` and `N`.

**Adjustments:**
- To ensure that the loop executes, `N` must have at least one element.
- The values of `T`, `S`, `cur`, and `M` do not affect the execution of the loop and thus do not need to be adjusted.

**Final State:**
State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary**.
