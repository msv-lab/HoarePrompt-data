To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `cur`. Let's break down the provided information and adjust accordingly.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `i + 1` if `M[i] <= i`. Otherwise, `i` is `i + 1` and `cur` remains `i`.
- `cur` is `i + 1` if `M[i] <= i`. Otherwise, `cur` remains `i`.

Given the for loop:
```python
for i in range(cur):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `cur`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's consider the two cases based on the condition `M[i] <= i`:

1. **Case 1: `M[i] <= i`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented to `i + 1` and `cur` was also set to `i + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented again to `i + 2`, and `cur` will remain `i + 1`.

2. **Case 2: `M[i] > i`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented to `i + 1` and `cur` remained `i`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented again to `i + 2`, and `cur` will remain `i`.

In both cases, `i` will be incremented by 1, and `cur` will be adjusted based on the condition `M[i] <= i` from the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `cur` is `i + 1` if `M[i + 1] <= i + 1`. Otherwise, `cur` is `i + 1`**

However, we need to express the state in terms of the updated `i` value. Let's denote the new `i` value as `i_new = i + 1` from the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is `i_new + 1`, `cur` is `i_new + 1` if `M[i_new + 1] <= i_new + 1`. Otherwise, `cur` is `i_new`**

Simplifying, we get:

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `cur` is `i + 2` if `M[i + 2] <= i + 2`. Otherwise, `cur` is `i + 1`**

Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `cur` is `i + 2` if `M[i + 2] <= i + 2`. Otherwise, `cur` is `i + 1`**
