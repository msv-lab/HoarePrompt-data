Postcondition: **`cur` is `num`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer. If `num` was the only key in `M` before and `num` is not greater than `cur`, then `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 2}`. Otherwise, `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 1}`.**

This postcondition captures the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts of the statement.
