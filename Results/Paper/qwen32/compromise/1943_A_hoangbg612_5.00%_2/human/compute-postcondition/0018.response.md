The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more elements in the list `N` to iterate over.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was some integer, and `cur` and `M` were updated based on the comparison between `num` and `cur`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the next element in the list `N`.

State: **`num` is the next element in the list `N`, `cur` is an integer, `M` is a dictionary**
