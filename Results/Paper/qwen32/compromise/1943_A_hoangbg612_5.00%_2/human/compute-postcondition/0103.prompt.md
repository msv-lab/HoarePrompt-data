Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is the last element in `N` or the last `num` processed before the loop breaks, incremented by 1 if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`. `T` remains unchanged; `S` remains unchanged; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is `i`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is `i` if `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, otherwise `cur` remains `i + 1`. `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers, and `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is `i` if `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, otherwise `cur` remains `i + 1`. `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts, `i` is `i + 1`. If `M[i] <= i`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
