The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cur`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `cur`. If `i` is less than `cur`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is greater than 0 and `i` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `cur`.

Given that `i` has just been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `cur` is greater than the new value of `i`. Since `cur` was greater than `i` at the end of the last iteration, incrementing `i` by 1 means `cur` must be at least `i + 1` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 1, and `cur` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`cur` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**
