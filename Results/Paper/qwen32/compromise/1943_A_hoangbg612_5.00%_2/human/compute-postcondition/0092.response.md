The value of `cur` is updated to the value of `i`. The other variables, `T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, and the condition that `cur` must be greater than 0, remain unchanged. The current value of `M[i]` is still less than or equal to `i`.

Output State: **`cur` is `i`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts, and the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.**
