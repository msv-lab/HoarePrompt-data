To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the given Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `cur` is set to the smallest `i` in the range `[0, cur - 1]` such that `M[i] <= i`. If no such `i` exists, `cur` remains unchanged.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(cur)
```

### Analysis:
The value of `cur` is determined by the condition `M[i] <= i` for `i` in the range `[0, cur - 1]`. If there is no such `i`, `cur` remains unchanged.

To break it down:
- We need to check each index `i` from `0` to `cur - 1` to see if `M[i] <= i`.
- If we find such an `i`, `cur` is updated to this `i`.
- If no such `i` exists, `cur` remains the same.

Since the exact value of `cur` and the list `M` are not provided, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `cur`. However, we can describe what `cur` represents based on the given condition.

### Conclusion:
The `print(cur)` statement will print the value of `cur` which is either:
- The smallest `i` in the range `[0, cur - 1]` such that `M[i] <= i`, if such an `i` exists.
- The original value of `cur` if no such `i` exists.

Thus, the most precise description possible based on the given information is:

Output: **cur (where cur is the smallest i in the range [0, cur - 1] such that M[i] <= i, or the original value of cur if no such i exists)**
