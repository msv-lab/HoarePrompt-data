Output State: **`cur` is `num + 1` if `num` was greater than -1, or 0 if `num` was -1; `T` remains unchanged; `S` remains unchanged; `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than -1, or an empty dictionary if `num` is less than or equal to -1; `num` is the next element in `N` after the previous `num` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, none of the variables `cur`, `T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, or `num` have changed their values. The only impact is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
