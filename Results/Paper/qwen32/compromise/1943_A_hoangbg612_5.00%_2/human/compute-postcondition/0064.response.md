Postcondition: **`cur` is 0 if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, otherwise `cur` remains -1. `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, and `M` is an empty dictionary. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
