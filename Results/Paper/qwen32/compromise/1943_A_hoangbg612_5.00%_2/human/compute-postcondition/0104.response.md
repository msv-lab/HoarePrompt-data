To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop iterates from `0` to `cur-1` (inclusive). For each iteration `i`, it checks if the count of `i` in the dictionary `M` (i.e., `M[i]`) is less than or equal to `i`. If this condition is met, `cur` is set to `i` and the loop breaks. If not, the loop continues to the next iteration.

From the given states:
1. After the first iteration, if `M[0] <= 0`, the loop breaks, and `cur` is set to `0`.
2. After the second iteration, if `M[1] <= 1`, the loop breaks and `cur` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains `2`.
3. After the third iteration, if `M[2] <= 2`, the loop breaks and `cur` is set to `2`. Otherwise, `cur` remains `3`.

Given this pattern, we can infer that the loop will continue until it finds an `i` such that `M[i] <= i`. If no such `i` is found within the range `[0, cur-1]`, `cur` will remain unchanged from its initial value.

Therefore, the final output state depends on the values in `M` and the initial value of `cur`. Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds an `i` where `M[i] <= i`, the final value of `cur` will be the smallest `i` that satisfies this condition, or the initial value of `cur` if no such `i` is found within the range.

Let's summarize the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **`cur` is the smallest `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, or the initial value of `cur` if no such `i` is found within the range `[0, cur-1]`. `T` remains unchanged; `S` remains unchanged; `N` remains a sorted list of integers; `M` remains a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts.**

In simpler terms, `cur` will be the smallest index `i` where the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`, or it will remain the same if no such index is found within the loop's range.
