Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M` is a dictionary with the key `num` and the value `1`, and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `M` is a dictionary with the key `-1` and the value `1`, and `cur` remains `-1`.**
