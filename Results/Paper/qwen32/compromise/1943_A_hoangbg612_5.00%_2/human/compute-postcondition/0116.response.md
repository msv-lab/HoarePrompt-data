Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cur` is 0, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `num` is greater than 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables do not change, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
