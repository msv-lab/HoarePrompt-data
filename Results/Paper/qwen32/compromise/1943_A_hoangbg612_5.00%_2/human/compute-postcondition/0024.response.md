The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. The initial state specifies that `num` is the next element in the list `N`, and `cur` is an integer. The dictionary `M` is also part of the initial state. 

After executing the code, the value of `M[cur]` is increased by 1. The values of `num` and `N` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `N`, `cur` is an integer, `M` is a dictionary with `M[cur]` incremented by 1.**
