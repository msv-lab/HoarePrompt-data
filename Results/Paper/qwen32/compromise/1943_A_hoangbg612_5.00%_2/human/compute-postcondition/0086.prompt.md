Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is -1, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `M` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is either `num` if `num` is greater than -1, or -1 if `num` is less than or equal to -1. `T` remains unchanged. `S` is an input integer. `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer. `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than -1, or an empty dictionary if `num` is less than or equal to -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is `num`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer. If `num` was the only key in `M` before and `num` is not greater than `cur`, then `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 2}`. Otherwise, `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 1}`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is `num`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M[num]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[num]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
