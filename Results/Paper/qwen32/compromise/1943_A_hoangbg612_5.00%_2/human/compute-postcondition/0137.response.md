The given code snippet increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The values of `N`, `T`, `S`, `num`, and `num_next` remain unchanged. The only variable that is affected is `M[cur]`, which is incremented.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after `num_next`. If `num > cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num_next` and `M[num_next]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`. `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
