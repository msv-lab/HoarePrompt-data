In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, and the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that is not used within the loop body. 

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned to be within specific ranges, but they are not part of the loop head, so we do not need to adjust them for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
