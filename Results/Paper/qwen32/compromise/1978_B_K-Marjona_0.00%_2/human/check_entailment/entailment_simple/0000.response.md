### Reasoning:
The goal of the problem is to maximize Bob's profit by determining the optimal number of buns, `k`, to sell at a modified price. The modified price for the first `i` buns is `(b - i + 1)` coins, and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.

Let's analyze the given program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determining `k`:**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This means `k` is the smaller value between the total number of buns `n` and the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob sells all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is simply `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the program calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price. The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \left(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2}\right) * k + (n - k) * a
     \]
   - This formula calculates the sum of an arithmetic series for the first `k` buns and adds the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

4. **Execution States:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases:
     - When `b <= a`, it sells all buns at the usual price.
     - When `b > a`, it calculates the profit by considering the optimal `k` as `min(n, b - a)`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum profit for each test case as described.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and calculates the profit accurately.
