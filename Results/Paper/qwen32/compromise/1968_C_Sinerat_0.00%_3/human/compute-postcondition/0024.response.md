Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of the input; `x` is a new list of integers; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and each subsequent element at index `i` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the sum of 500 and all elements in `x` up to index `i-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `a` will have its first element as 500, and each subsequent element will be the cumulative sum starting from 500, adding the corresponding elements from the list `x` sequentially.
