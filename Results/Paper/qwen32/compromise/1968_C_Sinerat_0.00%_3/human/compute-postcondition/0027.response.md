The provided code snippet only contains the line `n = int(input())`, which means that the variable `n` is being reassigned to the integer value of whatever is input by the user. The other variables `t`, `x`, and `a` are not affected by this line of code. 

Since `n` is reassigned, the new value of `n` will be the integer input provided by the user, and the precondition for `n` being the integer value of the input is updated accordingly. The other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of the input; `x` is a new list of integers; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and each subsequent element at index `i` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the sum of 500 and all elements in `x` up to index `i-1`.**
