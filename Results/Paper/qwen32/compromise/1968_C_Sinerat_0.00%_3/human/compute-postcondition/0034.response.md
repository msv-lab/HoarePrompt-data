The given code updates the value of `a[i]` based on the previous value `a[i-1]` and the corresponding value in the list `x`. Specifically, it sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `x` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is calculated as the sum of 500 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` up to the previous index.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

After executing the code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, the value of `a[i]` changes. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated at index `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is now `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
