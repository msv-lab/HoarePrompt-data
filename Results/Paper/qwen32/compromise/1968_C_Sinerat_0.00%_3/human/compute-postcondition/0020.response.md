The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration to proceed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `x` is a new list of integers; `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 500 and the second element set to `500 + x[0]`; `i` is 2**
