Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer.**

In natural language: The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The variable `n` retains its value as an input integer. A new variable `x` is created and assigned a list of integers, which are derived from splitting an input string and converting each split part into an integer.
