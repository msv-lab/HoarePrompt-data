The code snippet creates a new list `a` with `n` elements, all initialized to 0. The values of `t` and `x` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` zeros.**
