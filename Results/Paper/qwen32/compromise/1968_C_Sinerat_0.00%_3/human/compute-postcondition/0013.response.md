The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times based on the input. This means that the state of `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not used within the loop body and is not relevant to the loop's continuation condition.

However, the loop will execute based on the integer value obtained from `int(input())`. This value determines how many times the loop will run. Since the loop head does not contain any variables that are modified within the loop body, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, and `a` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, ..., and the i-th element (for i > 0) is the sum of the (i-1)-th element of `a` and the (i-1)-th element of `x`.**
