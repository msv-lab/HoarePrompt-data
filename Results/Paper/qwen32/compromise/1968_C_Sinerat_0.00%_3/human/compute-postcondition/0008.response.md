The given code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` based on the previous values of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, the code will set `a[2]` to the sum of `a[1]` and `x[1]`.

Let's break it down:
- `a[1]` is the sum of `a[0]` and `x[0]`. Since `a[0]` is 500, `a[1]` is `500 + x[0]`.
- `a[2]` is then set to `a[1] + x[1]`, which is `(500 + x[0]) + x[1]`.

So, `a[2]` will be `500 + x[0] + x[1]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `a` for indices other than 2, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, and the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`; `i` is 2**.
