Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of the input; `x` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting the new input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 500.**

In this output state, the only change is that the first element of the list `a` has been set to 500. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
