The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the loop statement `for i in range(1, n)`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. The variable `n` must remain greater than 1, and since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 3; `x` is a new list of integers; `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 500, the second element set to `500 + x[0]`, and the third element set to `500 + x[0] + x[1]`; `i` is 3**
