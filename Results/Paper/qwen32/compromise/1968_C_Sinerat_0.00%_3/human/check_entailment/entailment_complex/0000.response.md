Reasoning:
The provided program constructs an array `a` for each test case based on the input list `x`. The first element of `a` is set to 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` is calculated as the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`. 

The key requirement to verify is whether `a_i % a_{i-1} == x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. Given the construction method, let's check this condition:

- For `i = 1`: `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + x[0]`. Since `x[0] < 500`, it follows that `a[1] % a[0] = (500 + x[0]) % 500 = x[0]`, which satisfies the condition.
- For `i = 2`: `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = (500 + x[0]) + x[1]`. We need to check if `a[2] % a[1] == x[1]`. Since `a[1] = 500 + x[0]`, we have `a[2] % a[1] = ((500 + x[0]) + x[1]) % (500 + x[0]) = x[1]`, which also satisfies the condition.
- This pattern continues for all subsequent elements, ensuring that `a_i % a_{i-1} == x_i` holds true for all `2 <= i <= n`.

Since the program constructs the array `a` in such a way that it satisfies the required conditions, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
