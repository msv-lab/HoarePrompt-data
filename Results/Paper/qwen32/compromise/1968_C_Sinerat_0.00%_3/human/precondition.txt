t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case and contains two elements: the first element is an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 500, and the second element is a list of n-1 integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n such that 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 1 <= i <= n-1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
