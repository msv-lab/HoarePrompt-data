The code `index += 1` increments the value of the variable `index` by 1. The initial value of `index` is 0, so after the increment, `index` becomes 1. The other variables (`arr`, `input`, `data`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
