b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of b is a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). The function `func_1` is called once for each test case, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings b across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
