#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of b is a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). The function `func_1` is called once for each test case, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings b across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

    #The program returns the string `s` where each character in the original string `b` has been replaced by its corresponding character from `char_map`, which maps unique characters in `b` to characters from 'z' to 'a' in descending order based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s` where each unique character in `b` is replaced by a unique character from 'z' to 'a', mapping the lexicographically smallest character in `b` to 'z', the next smallest to 'y', and so on.
