The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `results` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, only its body.

Given that `t` is an input integer and the loop will execute `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list**
