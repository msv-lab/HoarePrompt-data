The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20. It then processes these strings using another function `func_1` and stores the results. After processing all test cases, it prints the results for each one.
