Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We have an array `a` of length `n`.
- We can perform an operation where we split the array into two parts `x` and `y` such that `a = x + y` and then swap `x` and `y` to get `a = y + x`.
- The task is to determine if we can sort the array in non-decreasing order using this operation any number of times.

### Solution Explanation:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a)`: This function checks if the array `a` can be sorted by performing the described operation.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Analysis of `func_1(a)`:
- The function first calculates the length of the array `n`.
- It then creates a sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.
- It creates a new array `concatenated_a` which is the original array `a` concatenated with itself.
- The function then checks if any subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (which corresponds to the original array `a` in some rotation) matches `sorted_a`.
- If a match is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the operation. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

#### Correctness of the Approach:
- The key insight is that if the array can be sorted by the described operation, then there must be a rotation of the array that is sorted.
- By concatenating the array with itself, we can easily check all possible rotations of the array.
- If any rotation matches the sorted version of the array, then it is possible to sort the array using the operation, and the function correctly returns 'Yes'.
- If no rotation matches the sorted version, the function correctly returns 'No'.

### Testing with the Example:
Let's test the example provided in the problem statement:
1. For the first test case (`[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`):
   - The sorted version is `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`.
   - Checking all rotations of the concatenated array, we find that none match the sorted version.
   - The function correctly returns 'No'.
2. For the second test case (`[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`):
   - The sorted version is `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`.
   - Checking all rotations, we find that the rotation `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` matches the sorted version.
   - The function correctly returns 'Yes'.
3. For the third test case (`[1, 2, 3]`):
   - The sorted version is `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - The original array is already sorted, so it matches the sorted version.
   - The function correctly returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
