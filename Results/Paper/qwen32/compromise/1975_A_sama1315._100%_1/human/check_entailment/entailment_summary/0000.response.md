Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and those parts are swapped. The key aspect is that the operation can be performed any number of times, including zero times.

The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a)`: This function checks if any contiguous subsequence of length equal to the list itself in a doubled version of the list matches the sorted version of the list. It does this by concatenating the list with itself and then checking if any slice of this concatenated list matches the sorted list. If a match is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

The output hints for `func_1` mention that the function always returns 'No', which is incorrect based on the problem requirements. The function should correctly identify when a valid rearrangement exists, not always return 'No'. This suggests that the logic in `func_1` is flawed.

Let's analyze the logic in `func_1` more closely:
- The function checks if any contiguous subsequence of length `n` in the doubled array matches the sorted array. This approach is theoretically correct because if the array can be rotated to become sorted, the sorted array will appear as a contiguous subsequence in the doubled array.
- However, the output hint stating that `func_1` always returns 'No' indicates there might be an issue in the implementation. This could be due to a logical error or an issue with the way the function is being tested.

Given the output hints and the problem description, it seems the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented, even though the concept is correct. Since `func_2` relies on `func_1` to produce the correct result for each test case, and `func_1` is not functioning as intended, the overall program is incorrect.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
