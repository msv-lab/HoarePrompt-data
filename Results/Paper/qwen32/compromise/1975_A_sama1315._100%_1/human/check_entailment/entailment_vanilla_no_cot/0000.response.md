To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to verify if the logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the described operation any number of times.

The operation allows splitting the array into two parts and swapping them. This is equivalent to checking if any rotation of the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. The program checks this by concatenating the array with itself and seeing if any subarray of the original length within this concatenated array is sorted.

Let's analyze the code:

1. **Concatenating the array with itself**: This step is correct because it allows us to check for any possible rotation of the original array.
2. **Checking for a sorted subarray**: The program iterates through the concatenated array and checks if any subarray of the original length is sorted. If it finds such a subarray, it returns 'Yes', otherwise 'No'.

The logic here is sound and should work correctly for the given problem constraints. The example provided in the problem statement is also handled correctly by the code.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Your response:
Correctness: **True**
