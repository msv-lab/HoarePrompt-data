To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `a` is the last list of integers processed by the loop.
- `idx` is the position right after the last list of integers in the input.
- `t` is unchanged.
- `results` contains the results of `func_1` for each list `a` processed in the loop.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

This statement will concatenate all the elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

Since the exact contents of `results` are not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of the contents of `results`. The `results` list contains the outputs of `func_1` for each list `a` processed in the loop.

Therefore, the output will be a string where each line corresponds to the result of `func_1` for a processed list `a`.

Output: **result1\nresult2\n...\nresultN (where result1, result2, ..., resultN are the results of func_1 for each list a processed in the loop)**
