The code reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This list of strings is then assigned to the variable `data`. The initial state of `a` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in `a` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`.**
