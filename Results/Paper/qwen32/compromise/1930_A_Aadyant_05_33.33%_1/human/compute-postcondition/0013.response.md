The code appends the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` to `list2`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before the code snippet, we need to consider the new value of `i`. The value of `list2` will now include the integer value of the element at the index `2 * i` in `list1`.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing a positive integer (1 ≤ int(num) ≤ 5000), `out` is an empty list, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of `list1[2 * j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `a` is an integer equal to the integer value of the original string `num` (1 ≤ a ≤ 5000), `b` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**.

In simpler terms: The variable `list2` now includes the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`, and `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
