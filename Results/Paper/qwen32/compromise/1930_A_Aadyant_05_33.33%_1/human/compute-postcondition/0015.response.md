Output State: **`num` is a string representing a positive integer (1 ≤ int(num) ≤ 5000), `out` is an empty list, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of `list1[2 * j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i` including the newly added `int(list1[2 * i])`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `a` is an integer equal to the integer value of the original string `num` (1 ≤ a ≤ 5000), `b` is the input string, `i` is `i + 2`**

Explanation: The value of `list2` has been updated to include the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`. All other variables retain their previous states and constraints.
