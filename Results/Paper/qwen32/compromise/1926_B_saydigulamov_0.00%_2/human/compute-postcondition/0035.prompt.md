Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is assigned the value of the first integer input, representing the size of the n x n grid, and `a` must be greater than 0; `k` is an empty list; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer; `b` is a string equal to the user input. If the string `b` contains the digit '1', `k` has an additional element which is the count of '1's in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer that is one greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred; `b` is a string equal to the user input. If the string `b` contains the digit '1', `k` has an additional element which is the count of '1's in `b`. If the string `b` does not contain the digit '1', `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer that is equal to the number of iterations that have already occurred; `b` is a string equal to the new user input. If the string `b` contains the digit '1', `k` has an additional element which is the count of '1's in `b`. If the string `b` does not contain the digit '1', `k` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
