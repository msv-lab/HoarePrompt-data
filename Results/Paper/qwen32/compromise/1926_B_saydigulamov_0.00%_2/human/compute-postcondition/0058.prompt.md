Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is assigned the value of the first integer input, representing the size of the n x n grid. The grid and its contents (composed of '0's and '1's) remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is assigned the value of the first integer input, representing the size of the n x n grid, and `a` must be greater than 0; `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from all the input strings `b` that contain at least one '1'. If the current value of `k[0]` is equal to the current value of `k[1]`, then no change is made to `a` or `k`. Otherwise, no change is made to `a` or `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` remains the initial input value; `k` is a list of counts of '1's from each string `b` that contained '1's; `i` is equal to `a`. If `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`, then the condition is met but no further changes occur to the variables. Otherwise, no changes occur as there is no else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` remains the initial input value, `i` is equal to `a + 1`, `k` is a list containing the counts of '1' from all the input strings that contained '1', and the first element of `k` is either equal to the second element of `k` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
