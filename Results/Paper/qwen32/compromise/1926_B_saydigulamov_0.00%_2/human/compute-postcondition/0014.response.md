The code snippet `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Given the initial state, if `b` contains the character '1', `k` was initially a list containing the count of '1' in `b`. After executing the code, the count of '1' in `b` is appended to `k`, making `k` a list with at least one element representing the count of '1' in `b`.

Output State: **`a` is assigned the value of the first integer input, representing the size of the n x n grid, and `a` must be greater than 0; `b` is the newly input string; `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the string `b` appended to its previous contents.**
