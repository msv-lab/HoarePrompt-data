You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4b06bb9ff8f408edc96077ace0d5e299065a3c50.png)
Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the n x n grid. This is followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one shape, which is either a triangle or a square, and this shape is composed of all the '1's in the grid. The size of the shape (k) is greater than 1, meaning the shape cannot consist of a single '1'.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: `a` remains the initial input value, and `i` is equal to `a`. The list `k` is recalculated in each iteration but is only printed if `k[0]` equals `k[1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an n x n grid of '0's and '1's. For each grid, it checks the number of '1's in the first two rows and prints the list of counts if they are equal. The function does not return any specific value; it only prints output under certain conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to determine whether a given binary grid contains a square or a triangle. However, the implementation is incomplete and incorrect for the given problem. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incomplete Logic**: The program only counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in the list `k`. It then checks if the first two counts are equal, which is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.

2. **Output Issue**: The program prints the list `k` when the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal, which is not the required output. The required output is either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

3. **No Handling of Upside Down Triangles**: The program does not handle upside-down triangles, as it only checks the counts of '1's in the rows.

4. **No Handling of Different Sizes**: The program does not correctly handle grids where the shape might not start from the first row or column.

5. **No Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: While the program iterates over multiple test cases, it does not correctly determine and print the shape for each test case.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
