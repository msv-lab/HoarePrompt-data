### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
Bob can form another rectangle if:
- He can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles.
- From these two smaller rectangles, he can form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Even Dimensions:** If both `a` and `b` are even, the rectangle can be cut into smaller rectangles of even dimensions, allowing the formation of another rectangle.
2. **Odd Dimensions:** If either `a` or `b` is odd, the rectangle can still be cut into two smaller rectangles, but the condition for forming a new rectangle is that the difference between `a` and `b` should be odd. This is because cutting an odd dimension will result in two rectangles of different dimensions, which can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

#### Analysis of Program Logic:
1. **Even Dimensions Check:**
   - `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` 
     - This correctly checks if both dimensions are even and prints 'yes'.
   
2. **Odd Dimensions Check:**
   - `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:`
     - This condition is intended to check if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. However, `(a - b) % 2` will never be greater than 0 and less than 0 at the same time. Instead, it will be either 0 (even difference) or 1 (odd difference).
     - The correct condition should be `elif (a - b) % 2 != 0:` or `elif (a - b) % 2 == 1:`.
   
3. **Incorrect Conditions:**
   - `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):`
     - This condition is incorrect and does not serve any purpose as it checks for an impossible condition.
   
4. **Default Case:**
   - `else: print('no')`
     - This will handle cases where the above conditions are not met, which is correct for the default 'no' scenario.

#### Corrected Conditions:
- The program should correctly check if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd when either `a` or `b` is odd.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical error in the condition for checking odd dimensions. The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is incorrect and should be replaced with `elif (a - b) % 2 != 0:`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is not entirely correct due to the incorrect condition for handling odd dimensions.
