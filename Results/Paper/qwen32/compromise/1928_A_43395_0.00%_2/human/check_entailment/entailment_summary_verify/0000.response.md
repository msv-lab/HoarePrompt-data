Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate or inaccurate.

### Problem Analysis
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He can cut this rectangle into two rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. He then tries to form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles. The key points are:
1. If either dimension `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle.
2. If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle because he cannot cut the rectangle into two equal parts.

### Program Analysis
The given program has several issues:
1. The condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect and will always evaluate to `True` because it creates tuples that are always truthy.
2. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is also incorrect because it will always be `True` for any non-zero `a - b`, which is not the intended logic.
3. The logic for determining if Bob can form another rectangle is flawed. The correct condition should be checking if either `a` or `b` is even.

### Corrected Program
The corrected version of the program should be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary provided does not accurately describe the logic in the given program. It mentions checking if both dimensions are even, which is not the correct condition. The correct condition should be checking if at least one of the dimensions is even.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program contains logical errors and does not correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The corrected version of the program, which checks if either dimension is even, is the correct approach.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.
