Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding

Bob can cut his rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. He then tries to form a new rectangle using the two smaller rectangles. The key point is that the new rectangle must have different dimensions than the original one (considering rotations as the same).

**Key Observations:**
1. If either dimension is 1, Bob cannot form a different rectangle because the only possible smaller rectangles would be 1x1, and no new rectangle can be formed.
2. If both dimensions are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle (e.g., from 2x4, cut into two 2x2, form 4x2).
3. If one dimension is even and the other is odd, Bob can form a new rectangle (e.g., from 2x3, cut into two 2x1.5, form 3x2).
4. If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle because the resulting smaller rectangles will be of the form odd x 1, and no new rectangle can be formed that is different from the original.

### Code Analysis

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

- **First Condition:** `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` 
  - This condition correctly identifies that if both dimensions are even, Bob can form a new rectangle.
  
- **Second Condition:** `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):`
  - This condition is incorrect. The logic `(a - b == -a, a)` is a tuple comparison which does not make sense in this context. It seems to be trying to check if the dimensions are the same, but the logic is flawed. This condition doesn't correctly handle the case where both dimensions are odd, which should result in "no".
  
- **Third Condition:** `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:`
  - This condition is incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either 0, 1, or -1. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` will always evaluate to true for any non-zero difference between `a` and `b` because `(a - b) % 2` will either be 1 or -1. This means that the condition will incorrectly print "yes" for cases where `a` and `b` are both odd, which should result in "no".

- **Else Condition:** `else:`
  - This condition is a fallback, but due to the incorrect conditions above, it may not be reached correctly.

### Correctness

Based on the above analysis, the program is indeed incorrect due to the flawed logic in the second and third conditions. Specifically:

- The second condition does not correctly handle the case where both dimensions are odd.
- The third condition is incorrectly structured and will incorrectly print "yes" for cases where `a` and `b` are both odd.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
