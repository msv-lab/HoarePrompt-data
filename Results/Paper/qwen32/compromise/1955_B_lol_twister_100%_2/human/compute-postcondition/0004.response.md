To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
```

This line of code appends a calculated value to the list `li`. The value being appended is `a + k * c + d * h`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500
- `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6
- `l` is a list of n * n integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9
- `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`
- `li` is an empty list

The code snippet introduces two new variables `k` and `h` which are not defined in the initial state. Since these variables are not defined, we cannot compute their exact values. However, we can express the appended value in terms of these variables.

After executing the code snippet, the list `li` will contain one element, which is `a + k * c + d * h`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n * n integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element `a + k * c + d * h`**.
