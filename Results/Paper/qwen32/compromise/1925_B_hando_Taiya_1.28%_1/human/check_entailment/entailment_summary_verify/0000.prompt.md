You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or its corresponding pair divisor `x // i` that is also less than or equal to `n`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged after processing each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum balance of the problemset by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems optimally. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `x` (total difficulty) and `n` (number of sub-problems).

2. **Finding the Maximum Balance**: For each test case, the program iterates through possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:
   - It checks if the number of sub-problems `n` can be accommodated with `i` as a divisor. Specifically, it checks if `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`.
   - If either condition is true, it updates the maximum balance `ans` to be the maximum of the current `ans` and the divisor `i` or `x // i`.

3. **Output**: After processing all possible divisors, the program prints the maximum balance `ans` for each test case.

The logic ensures that the program correctly identifies the largest possible GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties that can be achieved given the constraints. The program efficiently handles the constraints by iterating only up to the square root of `x`, which is optimal for this type of problem.

No edge cases or potential issues were found where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
