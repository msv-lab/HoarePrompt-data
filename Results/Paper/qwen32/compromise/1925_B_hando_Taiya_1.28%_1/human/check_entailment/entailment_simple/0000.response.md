### Reasoning:

The program is designed to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset of `n` sub-problems with a total difficulty of `x`. The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems. The program iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to the integer square root of `x` to find the largest divisor that can be used as the balance, ensuring that the number of sub-problems `n` can be satisfied with the chosen divisor.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` (total difficulty) and `n` (number of sub-problems).

2. **Finding the Maximum Balance:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance found.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1` (inclusive).
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` divides `x` without a remainder (`x % i == 0`).
   - If `i` is a divisor, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it means we can distribute the difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems, each having a difficulty of at least `i`. Hence, `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it means we can distribute the difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems, each having a difficulty of at least `x // i`. Hence, `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - The program prints the value of `ans` after processing all divisors for the current test case.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The approach ensures that we find the largest possible divisor of `x` that can be used as the balance, while also ensuring that the number of sub-problems `n` can be satisfied.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and provides the expected output for the given examples.

### Correctness:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance for the given problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
