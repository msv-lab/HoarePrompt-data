Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the First Row**: The code incorrectly assumes that if the second last character in the second row is not '>', the robot cannot reach the destination. This is not necessarily true, as the robot can still reach the destination if it can navigate properly through the grid.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Single Column Case**: The code incorrectly prints 'YES' for a single column case, which is not possible since `n` is always even and at least 2.

3. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The loops in the code do not correctly handle the conditions for checking the paths. The code checks for '>' in the second row at even indices and in the first row at odd indices, but it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and arrow following.

4. **Inefficient and Incorrect Path Checking**: The code does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step according to the problem description. It does not handle the possibility of the robot moving left, right, down, or up and then following the arrow in the current cell.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

In this case, the robot can start at (1, 1), move to (1, 2), follow the arrow to (2, 2), move to (2, 1), follow the arrow to (1, 1), move to (1, 2), follow the arrow to (2, 2), move to (2, 3), follow the arrow to (1, 3), move to (1, 4), follow the arrow to (2, 4), and reach the destination (2, 4).

To correctly solve the problem, the code should simulate the robot's movement step-by-step according to the problem description.
