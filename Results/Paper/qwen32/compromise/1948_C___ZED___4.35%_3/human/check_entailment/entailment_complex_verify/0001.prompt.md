You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even. The following two lines for each test case contain strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is equal to `t-1` (indicating all iterations have completed), `n` is the integer from the last test case, `a` is the string from the last test case, and `b` is the string from the last test case. The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` made up of '<' and '>' characters. It prints 'YES' if it is possible to make the grid valid by potentially reversing some arrows, such that no two arrows point towards each other in the same column, and 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- The robot starts at position (1, 1).
- The robot moves in two steps: a free move (up, down, left, right) and then a forced move according to the direction of the arrow in the current cell.
- The goal is to determine if the robot can reach position (2, n).

### Key Points:
- The robot must be able to reach the last column (n) in the second row (2, n).
- The robot can move freely and then follow the direction of the arrow.
- The robot starts at (1, 1), and its first move must be carefully chosen to eventually lead to (2, n).

### Analysis of the Program:
The program iterates through each test case, reads the grid dimensions and arrow directions, and then attempts to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

1. **Immediate Check for `b[-2] != '>'`**:
   - If the second last cell in the second row does not point to the right, it is impossible to reach the last cell (2, n) directly from (2, n-1). This check is correct.

2. **Special Case for `n == 1`**:
   - If `n == 1`, the robot is already at the target position, so the program should print 'YES'. However, the problem statement specifies `2 <= n <= 2*10^5`, so this condition is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness for valid inputs.

3. **Checking Even Columns in the Second Row**:
   - The program iterates through all even-indexed columns in the second row (`b[k]` for `k` in `range(0, n, 2)`).
   - If any of these cells does not point to the right (`'>'`), it sets `no_path` to `False`. This seems to be intended to ensure that the robot can consistently move rightward in the second row.
   - However, this logic is flawed. The robot can move up or down freely, so the requirement that all even-indexed cells point to the right is too restrictive.

4. **Checking Odd Columns in the First Row**:
   - The program then iterates through all odd-indexed columns in the first row (`a[k]` for `k` in `range(1, n-1, 2)`).
   - If any of these cells does not point to the right (`'>'`), it sets `no_path` to `False`. This logic is also flawed for the same reason as above.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for determining if the robot can reach the target cell is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that all even-indexed cells in the second row and all odd-indexed cells in the first row must point to the right, which is not necessary for the robot to reach (2, n).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the target cell based on the problem's requirements.
