Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, and at least one character at even indices in `b` is not `'>'`. If `a[3]` is not `'>'`, then `no_path` is `False`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains `True`. `k` is 3.**
