Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` is at least 3.
   - `a` is the input string.
   - `b` is the input string.
   - The second-to-last character of `b` is '>'.
   - `k` is initialized to 5.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition checks if `a[k]` is not equal to '>'. If this condition is true, then `no_path` is set to False.
   - If `a[k]` is equal to '>', then `no_path` remains True.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(k)`.
   - According to the initial state, `k` is explicitly set to 5.

Since the print statement directly prints the value of `k`, and `k` is explicitly set to 5, the output will be the value of `k`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **5**
