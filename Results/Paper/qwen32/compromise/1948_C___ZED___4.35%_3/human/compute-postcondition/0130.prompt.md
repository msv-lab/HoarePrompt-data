Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even. The following two lines for each test case contain strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    if b[-2] != '>':
        print('NO')
    elif n == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        no_path = True
        for k in range(0, n, 2):
            if b[k] != '>':
                no_path = False
        if not no_path:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                print(k)
                if a[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
        if no_path:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string, and `b` is the input string. If the second last character of `b` is not '>', no further changes occur. If the second last character of `b` is '>', and `n` is 1, no further changes occur. If the second last character of `b` is '>' and `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the largest odd number less than or equal to `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-3` if `n` is odd. If `no_path` is `True`, all characters `a[k]` in the specified range were equal to `'>'`. If `no_path` is `False`, at least one character `a[k]` in the specified range was not equal to `'>'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are strings. If the second last character of `b` is not '>', no further changes occur. If the second last character of `b` is '>' and `n` is 1, no further changes occur. If the second last character of `b` is '>' and `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the largest odd number less than or equal to `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-3` if `n` is odd. If `no_path` is `True`, either all characters `a[k]` in the specified range were equal to `'>'` (when `n` is 1) or at least one character `a[k]` in the specified range was not equal to `'>'` (when `n` is greater than 1). If `no_path` is `False`, at least one character `a[k]` in the specified range was not equal to `'>'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string. If the second last character of `b` is not `'>'`, then `no_path` is a boolean indicating whether any character at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index less than `n` in `b` is not `'>'`, and `k` is the last odd number less than `n-1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
