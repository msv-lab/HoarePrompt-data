Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string, and `no_path` is False if any character at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index less than `n` in `b` is not `'>'`. Otherwise, `no_path` is True. If `no_path` is False, the loop has finished executing, and `k` is the last odd number less than `n-1`.***
