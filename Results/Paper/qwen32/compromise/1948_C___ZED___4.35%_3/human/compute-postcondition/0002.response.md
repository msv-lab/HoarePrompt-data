The code snippet assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `a`. This means `a` will hold the value of whatever string is input by the user. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string.**
