Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of a grid. The function returns the minimum number of arrow reversals required to make the grid valid, where a valid grid has no two arrows pointing towards each other in the same column.**
