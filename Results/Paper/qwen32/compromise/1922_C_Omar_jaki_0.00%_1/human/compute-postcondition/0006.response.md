Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than or equal to 0; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n+2` integers starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the original `n` integers in ascending order, and ending with `2000000000.0`; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n+2 and x_i ≠ y_i; `b` is `[0, 0]`.**

In simple terms, the output state is the same as the initial state except that a new list `b` has been initialized with the values `[0, 0]`. All other variables retain their original values.
