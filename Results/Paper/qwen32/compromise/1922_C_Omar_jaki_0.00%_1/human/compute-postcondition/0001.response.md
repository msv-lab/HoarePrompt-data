The code snippet reads a single integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**
