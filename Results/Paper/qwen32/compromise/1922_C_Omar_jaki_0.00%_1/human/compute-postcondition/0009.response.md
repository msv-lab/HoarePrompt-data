Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n+2` integers starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the original `n` integers in ascending order, and ending with `2000000000.0`.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
- `b` is `[0, 0]`.
- `v` is `y - x`.

Code Snippet:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

The code modifies the list `b` by appending two new elements to it. Let's break down the expressions being appended:

1. `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`
   - `b[-2]` refers to the second last element of `b`, which is `0` initially.
   - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v ** True` if `v > x - w` (which equals `v ** 1` or simply `v`), otherwise it evaluates to `v ** False` (which equals `v ** 0` or `1`).

2. `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`
   - `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is `0` initially.
   - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v ** True` if `v > z - y` (which equals `v`), otherwise it evaluates to `v ** False` (which equals `1`).

Given the initial state, the new elements added to `b` will be:
- First new element: `0 + v ** (v > x - w)`
- Second new element: `0 + v ** (v > z - y)`

Thus, the new list `b` will be `[0, 0, v ** (v > x - w), v ** (v > z - y)]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than or equal to 0; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n+2` integers starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the original `n` integers in ascending order, and ending with `2000000000.0`; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `b` is `[0, 0, v ** (v > x - w), v ** (v > z - y)]`; `v` is `y - x`.**
