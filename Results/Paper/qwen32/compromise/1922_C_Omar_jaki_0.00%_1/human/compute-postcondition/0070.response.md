Postcondition: **`u` is the second element of the tuple `a` minus 2 and must be a truthy value; `t` is potentially a different value; the list `b` remains potentially modified; `a` is a tuple with at least \( n+2 \) elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by \( n \) elements returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`; `c` and `d` are the new values returned by `r()`. Additionally, if `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
