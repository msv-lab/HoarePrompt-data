Postcondition: **`u` is `u - 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `t` is `t-1`, `b` is `[0, 0, v_or_1, v_or_1, v_or_1 + v, v_or_1 + v, ..., accumulated sums]`, `a` is a tuple with at least \( n+2 \) elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by \( n \) elements returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, `c` is the first value returned by the new call to `r()`, and `d` is the second value returned by the new call to `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
