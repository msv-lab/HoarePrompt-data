The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state in the given context. Therefore, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`possible` is True if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is False. `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string, `i` is `i + 1`.**
