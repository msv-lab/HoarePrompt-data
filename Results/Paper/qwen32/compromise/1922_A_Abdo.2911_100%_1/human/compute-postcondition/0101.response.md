Postcondition: **`possible` is True if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, otherwise `possible` remains False. `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`. If `possible` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
