The code snippet sets the value of `possible` to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input value, `b` is the stripped input value, `c` is the stripped input value, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor equal to `b[i]`.**
