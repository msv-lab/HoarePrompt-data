Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is explicitly set to `True`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain as they were described in the initial state, with `t` being decremented by 1 and `i` being incremented by 1.
