Postcondition: **`possible` is True if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is False. `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and not equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes the conditions under which `possible` is set to True or False, and the behavior of the program based on the values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]`.
