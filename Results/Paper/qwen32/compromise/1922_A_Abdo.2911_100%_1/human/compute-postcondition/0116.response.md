Output State: **`possible` is True; `t` is at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the newly input and stripped string; `c` is the newly input and stripped string; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `possible`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
