Postcondition: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `a[i] != b[i]`, `possible` is set to True if `c[i] != a[i]`, and the loop is broken out of. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and the loop is broken out of.**
