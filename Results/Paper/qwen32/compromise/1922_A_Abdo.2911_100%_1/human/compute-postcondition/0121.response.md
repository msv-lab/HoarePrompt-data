Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string, `i` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `possible`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
