Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    possible = False
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if c[i] != a[i]:
                possible = True
                break
        elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
            continue
        else:
            possible = True
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `possible` is a boolean. If `possible` is `True`, it means that at some index `i`, either `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]`, or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`. If `possible` is `False`, it means that for every index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is also equal to `a[i]`, or `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `possible` is a boolean indicating whether any iteration met the break conditions. `t` has been decremented by 1, and `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `possible` is a boolean that will be `True` if any of the conditions for setting it to `True` were met at any iteration, otherwise it will be `False`. `t` remains at least 1. `n` remains the input integer. `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the stripped input strings.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
