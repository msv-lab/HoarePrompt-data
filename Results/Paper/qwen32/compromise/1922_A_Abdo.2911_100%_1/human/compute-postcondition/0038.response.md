Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `possible` remains undetermined. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `possible` remains undetermined. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
