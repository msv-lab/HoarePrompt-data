The code snippet provided is simply a `break` statement, which would terminate the innermost loop or switch block it is contained within. However, since no loop or switch block is specified in the initial state, the `break` statement does not affect any of the variables listed. Thus, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `possible` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 2; `possible` is True.**
