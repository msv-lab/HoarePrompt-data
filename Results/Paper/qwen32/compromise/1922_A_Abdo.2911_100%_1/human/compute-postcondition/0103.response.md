Postcondition: **`possible` is False, `t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. The current value of `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`.**
