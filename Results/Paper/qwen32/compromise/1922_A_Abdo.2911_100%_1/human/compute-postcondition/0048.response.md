The code snippet assigns the value of `input().strip()` to the variable `a`. This means `a` will hold the input value after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `possible`, `t`, and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`possible` is a boolean, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input value.**
