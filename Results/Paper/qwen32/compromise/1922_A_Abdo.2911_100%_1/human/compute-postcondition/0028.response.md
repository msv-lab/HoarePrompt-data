The code provided is a `break` statement, which will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within. Since there is no loop or if statement in the provided context, the `break` statement will not have any effect on the flow of the program or on the variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 1; `possible` is True.**
