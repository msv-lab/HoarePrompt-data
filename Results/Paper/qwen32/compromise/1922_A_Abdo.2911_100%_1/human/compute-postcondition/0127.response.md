Postcondition: **`possible` is True if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is False. `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string, `i` is 4. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the control flow checks `c[i]` and updates `possible` accordingly: if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` remains unchanged, and if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and not equal to `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and not equal to `b[i]`.**
