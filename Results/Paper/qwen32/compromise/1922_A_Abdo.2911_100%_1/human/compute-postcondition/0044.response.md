Let's analyze the given precondition and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `possible` remains `False` after all iterations.
- For every index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, one of the following conditions holds:
  - `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is also equal to `a[i]`.
  - `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without referencing any variables or conditions from the initial state. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly defined by the `print` statement itself.

### Conclusion:
The output is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
