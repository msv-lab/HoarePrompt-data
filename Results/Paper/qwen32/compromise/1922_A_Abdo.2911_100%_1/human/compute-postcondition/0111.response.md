Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `possible` has been explicitly set to `True` by the code snippet, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
