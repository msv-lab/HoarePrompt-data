Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their previous values with the exception that we have exited the most internal loop or if statement.
