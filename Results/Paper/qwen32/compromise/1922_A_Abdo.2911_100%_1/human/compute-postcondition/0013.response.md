Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 0; the current character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the current character at index `i` in `b`. If the current character at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the current character at index `i` in `a`, `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `possible` remains False.**
