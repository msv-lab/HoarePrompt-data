You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        possible = False
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` (with `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`). For each test case, it determines if there exists at least one position `i` where the character in `c` is different from the characters in both `a` and `b` at the same position. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

### Template Matching Rules:
- If the `i-th` character of the template `t` is lowercase, the `i-th` character of the string `s` must be the same as `t[i]`.
- If the `i-th` character of the template `t` is uppercase, the `i-th` character of the string `s` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over each character position `i` of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`:
1. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same:
   - The template character `t[i]` must be uppercase (since `a[i]` and `b[i]` must differ from `t[i]` if `t[i]` were lowercase).
   - The program checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]` since they are the same). If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
2. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different:
   - The template character `t[i]` must be lowercase (since `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same as `t[i]` if `t[i]` were lowercase).
   - The program checks if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If so, it continues to the next character.
   - If `c[i]` matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, it means `c` matches the template at this position, so the program continues to the next character.
   - If `c[i]` does not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, it means `c` does not match the template at this position, so it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

### Correctness Check:
The program correctly checks the conditions for each character position:
- It ensures that if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, `c[i]` must be different to satisfy the template matching rules.
- It ensures that if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, `c[i]` must also be different from both to satisfy the template matching rules.

The program successfully sets `possible` to `True` if it finds any position where `a` and `b` can match the template while `c` does not, and prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match `t` while `c` does not.
