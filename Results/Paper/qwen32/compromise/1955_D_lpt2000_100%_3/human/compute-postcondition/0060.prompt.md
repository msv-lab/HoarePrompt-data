Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `nabors` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `aa` is a list of strings representing the integers from the input line; `bb` is a list of strings representing the integers from the new input line; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the list `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, with counts being the minimum of the counts in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`; `E` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` or have a higher count in `cnt_aa` than in `D`; `C` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` or have a higher count in `cnt_bb` than in `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `nabors` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `aa` is a list of strings representing the integers from the input line with length `n`; `bb` is a list of strings representing the integers from the new input line with length `m`; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the list `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, with counts being the minimum of the counts in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `pairs_in_D` is adjusted based on the presence and count of `out_aa` in `E`; `E` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` or have a higher count in `cnt_aa` than in `D`; `C` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` or have a higher count in `cnt_bb` than in `D`. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, the count of `in_aa` in `D` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the count of `in_aa` in `E` is increased by 1; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0; `m` must be less than `n`. `fnd` is now 2 if `pairs_in_D` was already greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `nabors` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `aa` is a list of strings representing the integers from the input line with length `n`; `bb` is a list of strings representing the integers from the new input line with length `m`; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the list `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, with counts being the minimum of the counts in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, except `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`; `pairs_in_D` is adjusted based on the presence and count of `out_aa` in `E`; `E` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` or have a higher count in `cnt_aa` than in `D`, with the count of `out_aa` decremented by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`; `C` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` or have a higher count in `cnt_bb` than in `D`, with `C[out_aa]` increased by 1 if `E[out_aa] <= 0`; `fnd` is 2 if `pairs_in_D` was already greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 1; `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]` and `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`. Otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.`

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
