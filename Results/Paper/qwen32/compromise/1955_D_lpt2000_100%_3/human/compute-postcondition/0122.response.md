To determine what will be printed by the `print(fnd)` statement, let's break down the initial state and understand the relationships between the variables:

1. **Intersection (`D`)**: 
   - `D` is the intersection of the last `m` elements of lists `aa` and `bb`. This means `D` contains elements that are common to both the last `m` elements of `aa` and `bb`.

2. **Remaining Elements in `aa` (`E`)**:
   - `E` contains the elements from the last `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D`.

3. **Remaining Elements in `bb` (`C`)**:
   - `C` contains the elements from `bb` that are not in `D`.

4. **Sum of Values in `D` (`pairs_in_D`)**:
   - `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D` after any shifts. Since no specific shifts are mentioned in the initial state, we assume it refers to the sum of the elements in `D` as initially computed.

5. **Count of Times `pairs_in_D` is Greater Than or Equal to `k` (`fnd`)**:
   - `fnd` keeps track of how many times the sum of the values in `D` (`pairs_in_D`) is greater than or equal to `k`.

Given this setup, the `print(fnd)` statement will output the value of `fnd`, which is the count of instances where the sum of the intersection elements (`pairs_in_D`) is greater than or equal to `k`.

Since the exact values of `aa`, `bb`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `fnd`. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **fnd (where fnd is the count of times the sum of the intersection elements (pairs_in_D) is greater than or equal to k)**
