Postcondition: **`aa` must have at least `max(m, n - m)` elements, `m` must be less than `n`. `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0. If `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is now decremented by 1 and remains greater than 0, and `D[out_aa]` is unchanged. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 (and is greater than or equal to 0), `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, and `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1 while `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**
