The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated based on the input, while the other variables (`t`, `nabors`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `nabors` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.**
