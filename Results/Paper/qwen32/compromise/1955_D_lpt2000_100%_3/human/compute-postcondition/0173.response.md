Postcondition: **`aa` must have at least `max(m, n - m)` elements, `m` must be less than `n`, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**
