Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `nabors` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `aa` is a list of strings representing the integers from the input line; `bb` is a list of strings representing the integers from the new input line; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the list `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, with counts being the minimum of the counts in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`; `E` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` or have a higher count in `cnt_aa` than in `D`; `C` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` or have a higher count in `cnt_bb` than in `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.**
