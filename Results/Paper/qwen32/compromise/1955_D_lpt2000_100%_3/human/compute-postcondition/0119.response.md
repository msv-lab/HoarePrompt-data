Postcondition: **`in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa] <= 0`, `E[out_aa]` is also decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**
