Output State: **`aa` must have at least `max(m, n - m)` elements, `m` must be less than `n`, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
