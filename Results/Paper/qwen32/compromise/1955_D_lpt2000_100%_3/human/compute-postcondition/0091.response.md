Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `nabors` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `aa` is a list of strings representing the integers from the input line with length `n` and `m < n`; `bb` is a list of strings representing the integers from the new input line with length `m`; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the list `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. If `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0, then `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `C[in_aa]` remains 0 and `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, which may be incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0. `E` is a Counter object representing the remaining elements in `cnt_aa` that were not part of the maximum intersection. `C` is a Counter object representing the remaining elements in `cnt_bb` that were not part of the intersection `D`. `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0; `_` is incremented by 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from the input. `aa` is a list of strings representing the integers from the input line with length `n` and `m < n`. `bb` is now a list of strings representing the integers from the newly read input line with length `m`.**
