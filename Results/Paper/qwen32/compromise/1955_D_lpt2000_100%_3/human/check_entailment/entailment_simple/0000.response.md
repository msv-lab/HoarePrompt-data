### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by using a sliding window approach combined with the `Counter` class from the `collections` module. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Counters:**
   - `cnt_aa` is initialized as a `Counter` for the first `m` elements of `a`.
   - `cnt_bb` is initialized as a `Counter` for the elements of `b`.

3. **Intersection Calculation:**
   - `D` is calculated as the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, which represents the common elements between the first `m` elements of `a` and `b`.
   - `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, representing the number of matching elements.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window technique to process each subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - For each new element added to the window (`in_aa`) and each element removed from the window (`out_aa`), it updates the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` accordingly.
     - If `out_aa` is in `D`, it adjusts `D` and `C` based on whether `out_aa` is also in `E`.
     - If `in_aa` is in `C`, it adjusts `D` and `C` based on whether `in_aa` is also in `E`.
   - It checks if the number of matching elements (`pairs_in_D`) is greater than or equal to `k` and increments the count `fnd` if true.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all subsegments, the program prints the count `fnd` for each test case.

### Issues in the Code:
- **Type Conversion:** The program converts the input elements of `a` and `b` to strings before creating `Counter` objects. This is incorrect because the problem specifies that the elements are integers, not strings. This conversion will lead to incorrect counting since the `Counter` will treat '1' (string) and 1 (integer) as different elements.
- **Logic for Sliding Window:** The logic for updating `D`, `E`, and `C` seems correct, but the type conversion issue needs to be fixed.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the elements of `a` and `b` are treated as integers. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        aa = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        bb = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        
        pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
        
        E = cnt_aa - D
        
        C = cnt_bb - D
        
        fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m + 1]):
            if D[out_aa] > 0:
                if E[out_aa] > 0:
                    E[out_aa] -= 1
                else:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    pairs_in_D -= 1
                    C[out_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            if C[in_aa] > 0:
                D[in_aa] += 1
                pairs_in_D += 1
                C[in_aa] -= 1
            else:
                E[in_aa] += 1
            fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        print(fnd)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is incorrect due to the type conversion issue. The corrected code should work as expected.

**Correctness: False** (original code)
