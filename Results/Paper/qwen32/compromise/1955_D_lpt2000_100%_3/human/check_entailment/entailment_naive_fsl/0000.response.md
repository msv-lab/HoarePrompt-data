Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a few issues that could lead to incorrect results:

1. **String Conversion**: The program converts the input integers to strings using `str(i)` which is unnecessary and can cause issues when comparing values later on. The comparison should be done with integers.

2. **Counter Initialization**: The initial counters `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` are created from the string representations of the numbers, which means they will not match the integer values in the subsequent comparisons.

3. **Logic for Sliding Window**: The sliding window logic is generally correct, but because of the string conversion issue, it might not work as expected. For example, if `aa` contains the number `10` and `bb` contains the number `10`, the counter comparison will fail because they are compared as strings.

To fix these issues, the program should handle the input as integers throughout. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        aa = list(map(int, input().split()))
        bb = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
        E = cnt_aa - D
        C = cnt_bb - D
        fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        for (in_aa, out_aa) in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
            if D[out_aa] > 0:
                if E[out_aa] > 0:
                    E[out_aa] -= 1
                else:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    pairs_in_D -= 1
                    C[out_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            if C[in_aa] > 0:
                D[in_aa] += 1
                pairs_in_D += 1
                C[in_aa] -= 1
            else:
                E[in_aa] += 1
            fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        print(fnd)

# Uncomment the following line to run the function
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all comparisons are done with integers, which should resolve the issues identified.
