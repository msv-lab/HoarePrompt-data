Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `lst[2]` contains at least one element (now with one less element than before), `x` is the integer that was popped from `lst[y]`, `y` is the integer that was popped from `lst[x]`, and `s` is True. `lst[x]` has one less element than before. If `lst[y]` is not empty, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
