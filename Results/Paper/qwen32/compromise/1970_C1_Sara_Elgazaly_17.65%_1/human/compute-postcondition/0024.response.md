The code snippet `y = lst[x].pop()` pops the last element from the list located at index `x` in the list `lst` and assigns it to the variable `y`. Given that `x` is 2, it means the last element from `lst[2]` is popped and assigned to `y`. Since `lst[2]` contains at least one element, this operation will reduce the length of `lst[2]` by one.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `lst[2]` contains at least one element (now with one less element than before), `x` is 2, `y` is the integer that was popped from `lst[2]`, and `s` is True.**
