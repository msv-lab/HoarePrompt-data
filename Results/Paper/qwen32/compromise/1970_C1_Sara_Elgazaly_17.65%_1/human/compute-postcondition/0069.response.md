Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[x]` has at least one element, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element that was popped from `lst[x]` after the pop operation, and `s` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
