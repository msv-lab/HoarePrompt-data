Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is 2, `y` are the two integers read from the input, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. All other variables retain their initial values.
