Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `lst[2]` contains at least one element (now with one less element than before), `x` is the integer that was popped from `lst[2]`, `y` is the integer that was popped from `lst[2]`, and `s` is True. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `t`, the tree structure, the list of starting nodes, and the boolean `s` remain unchanged. The list `lst[2]` now has one less element than it did before, and the integers `x` and `y` have been popped from `lst[2]`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
