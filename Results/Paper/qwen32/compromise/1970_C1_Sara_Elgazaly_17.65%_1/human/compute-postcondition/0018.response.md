The code snippet provided removes the element `y` from the list stored in `lst` at the key `x` (which is 2). Since `lst[2]` initially contains `y` exactly once, after the `pop()` operation, `lst[2]` will be an empty list.

Here is the updated output state:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is 2, `y` is the integer that was popped from `lst[2]`, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[2]` is now an empty list, and `s` is True.**
