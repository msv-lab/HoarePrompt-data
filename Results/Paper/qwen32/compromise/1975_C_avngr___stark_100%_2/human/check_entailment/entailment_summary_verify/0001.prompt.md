You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it finds the maximum second smallest element in any contiguous subarray of length 3 from `a` and prints this value. If `n` is 2, it simply prints the minimum of the two elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the maximum possible value that the array can be reduced to using the specified three-step operation. The key operation involves selecting a subarray, finding its median, and setting all elements in that subarray to that median. The goal is to make all elements in the array the same and find the maximum possible value for that single element.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array and considering every possible subarray of length 3. It calculates the median of each subarray (which is the middle element after sorting the subarray) and keeps track of the maximum median found. The program then outputs this maximum median as the result for each test case.

### Correctness Evaluation
Let's consider the correctness of this approach:

1. **Subarray Length of 3**: The program only considers subarrays of length 3. However, the problem does not restrict the length of the subarray that can be chosen. The median operation can be performed on any subarray of length 2 or more. Therefore, the program might miss out on finding a higher median from longer subarrays.

2. **Maximum Median**: The program correctly identifies the median of each subarray of length 3 and keeps track of the maximum median found. However, since it does not consider subarrays of length greater than 3, it might not find the globally maximum median that could be achieved by a longer subarray.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - For arrays of length 2, the program correctly outputs the minimum of the two elements.
   - For longer arrays, it might not find the correct maximum median due to the restriction to subarrays of length 3.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided example:
- **Test Case 1**: `a = [1, 2]`
  - The program correctly identifies the median of the subarray `[1, 2]` as `1` and outputs `1`.
- **Test Case 2**: `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - The program considers subarrays of length 3:
    - `[1, 2, 3]` -> Median = `2`
    - `[2, 3, 4]` -> Median = `3`
    - `[3, 4, 5]` -> Median = `4`
  - The program outputs `4`, which is correct for this test case.

However, the program's approach is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible arrays, as it only considers subarrays of length 3.

### Conclusion
The program is not guaranteed to find the maximum possible median for all test cases because it only considers subarrays of length 3. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
