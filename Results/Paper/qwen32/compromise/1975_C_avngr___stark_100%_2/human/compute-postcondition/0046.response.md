The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 3` (non-inclusive), and assigns this slice to the variable `temp`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, but `i` is not explicitly reassigned in the snippet, so it retains its value of `i + 1` as given in the initial state. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is a slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
