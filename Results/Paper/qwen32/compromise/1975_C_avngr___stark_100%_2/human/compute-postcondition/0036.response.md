The code snippet `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. `t` is still greater than or equal to 2, `n` is still at least 3, `a` is still a list of integers derived from the input, and `max` is still 0. The only change is in the `temp` list, which is now sorted.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `max` is 0, `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
