The code snippet sorts the sublist `temp` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. The only change is in the ordering of elements within the `temp` sublist.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a new list of integers derived from the latest input, `i` is incremented by 1, `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
