The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` (not inclusive) and assigns the result to the variable `temp`. 

Given that `a` is a list of integers, `temp` will be a sublist of `a` containing up to three elements starting from index `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `max` are not affected by this operation.

The specific values of `a` and `i` are not provided, so we can only describe `temp` in terms of its relationship to `a` and `i`. However, we know that `temp` will be a slice of `a` starting at index `i` and including up to three elements.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `max` is 0, `temp` is a sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
