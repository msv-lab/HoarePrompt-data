The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` updates the value of `temp` to be a sublist of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 3` (not inclusive). This means `temp` now contains three elements from the list `a` starting from the current index `i`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, and `i`) are not directly affected by this code snippet and retain their original values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `temp` is a sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `max` retains its original value, `i` retains its original value.**
