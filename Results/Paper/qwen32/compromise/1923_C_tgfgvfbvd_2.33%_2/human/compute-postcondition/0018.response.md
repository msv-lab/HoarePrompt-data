Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the two integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are the two integers provided by the user input; `s` is the cumulative sum up to the `b`-th element of the list `l`. Additionally, `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0.**
