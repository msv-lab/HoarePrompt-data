Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`. The loop has processed all `m` queries, and for each query, it has printed 'YES' if the sum of the subarray from index `a` to `b` was at least twice the length of the subarray, otherwise 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `m` will be 0 because all the queries have been processed. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the loop will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each of the `m` queries based on the specified condition.
