The code snippet assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. Given that `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, and `b` is an integer read from the input, `s` will take the value of the cumulative sum up to the index `b-1` in the list `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
