The value of `c` is updated to be the sum of its current value (`x`) and the next element in the list `l` (also `x`). Therefore, `c` is now `2 * x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one integer; `p` is a list containing the integers 0 and `x`; `c` is `2 * x`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
