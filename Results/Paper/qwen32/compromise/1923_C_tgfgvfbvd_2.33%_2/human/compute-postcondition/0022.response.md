To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the conditions:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `n` and `m`: Integers provided by user input, with `m` being at least 1.
   - `l`: A list of integers provided by user input.
   - `p`: A list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c`: The sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `a` and `b`: Integers provided by user input.
   
2. **Conditions:**
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is the cumulative sum from the `a-1`-th element to the `b`-th element of the list `l`.
   - Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged (though its initial value isn't specified, it doesn't affect the `print('YES')` statement).
   - `b - a + 1 > 1` (indicating that there is more than one element in the range from `a` to `b` inclusive).
   - `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` (indicating that the sum `s` is at least twice the number of elements in the range).

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute regardless of the specific values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s` because the print statement does not depend on any of these variables directly. It simply prints 'YES'.

Thus, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
