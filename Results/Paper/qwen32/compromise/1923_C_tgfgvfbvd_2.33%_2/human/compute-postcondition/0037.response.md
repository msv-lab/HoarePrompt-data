The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from it. Given the initial state, `s` is initially set to `p[b - 1]`. After executing the code, `s` will be updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are the integers provided by the latest user input; `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
