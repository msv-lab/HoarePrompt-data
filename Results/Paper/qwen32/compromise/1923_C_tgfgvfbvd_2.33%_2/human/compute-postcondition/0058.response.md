In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `m` times. The loop will execute if and only if `m` is greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `c`) are not directly involved in controlling the execution of the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `m` is greater than 0. The other variables can remain as they are since they do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l`**.
