Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.**
