The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `x`. Since `x` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` now holds the value of `0 + x`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one integer; `p` is a list containing the integer 0; `c` is `x`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
