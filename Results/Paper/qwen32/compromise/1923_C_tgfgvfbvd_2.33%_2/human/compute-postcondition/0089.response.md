The code snippet `p = []` reassigns the variable `p` to an empty list, discarding its previous value which was a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is an empty list; `c` is the total sum of all elements in the previous `l`.**
