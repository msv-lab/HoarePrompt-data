The code snippet sets the variable `c` to 0. This affects the value of `c` while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is an empty list; `c` is 0.**
