The code snippet `s = p[b - 1]` updates the value of `s` to be the element at index `b - 1` in the list `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`
- `a` and `b` are the integers provided by the latest user input
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`
- The condition `if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` determines whether the condition is met

After executing `s = p[b - 1]`, the value of `s` is updated to `p[b - 1]`, regardless of the previous value of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are the integers provided by the latest user input; `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
