The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from it. Given the initial state, `s` was previously set to `p[b - 1]`. After executing the code, `s` will be `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
