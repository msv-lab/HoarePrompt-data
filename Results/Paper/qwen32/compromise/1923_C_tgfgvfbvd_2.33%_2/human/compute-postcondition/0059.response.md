The given code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.**
