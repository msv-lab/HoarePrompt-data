The provided Python code snippet contains a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, or `s` as it directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Here's the breakdown of the relevant parts:

- `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `n` and `m`: Integers provided by user input, with `m` being at least 1.
- `l`: A list of integers provided by user input.
- `p`: A list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c`: The sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b`: Integers provided by the latest user input.
- `s`: Calculated based on the values of `a` and `b` from the list `p`.

However, none of these variables affect the `print('YES')` statement. The statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
