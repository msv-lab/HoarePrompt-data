Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p[i] divides p[j] and p[i+1] divides p[j+1].

### Program Analysis

The given program does the following:

1. It reads the number of test cases t.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
3. Inside `func_1()`, it:
   - Creates a list `a` of integers from 1 to n.
   - Reverses the even-indexed elements of `a`.
   - Prints the modified list `a`.

Let's see if this approach satisfies the problem's requirements.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider the example given in the problem:

#### Test Case 1: n = 4

- Initial list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- After reversing the even-indexed elements: `[4, 2, 1, 3]`

Now let's check if this permutation satisfies the condition:
- p[1] = 4, p[2] = 2, p[3] = 1, p[4] = 3
- There are no pairs (i, j) such that p[i] divides p[j] and p[i+1] divides p[j+1].

#### Test Case 2: n = 3

- Initial list: `[1, 2, 3]`
- After reversing the even-indexed elements: `[1, 2, 3]` (no change as there's only one even index, which is 2, and it is the same in the reversed list)

Now let's check if this permutation satisfies the condition:
- p[1] = 1, p[2] = 2, p[3] = 3
- There are no pairs (i, j) such that p[i] divides p[j] and p[i+1] divides p[j+1].

### General Case

The provided program reverses the even-indexed elements of the list. This means that the even-indexed elements (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) are placed in reverse order while the odd-indexed elements (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) remain in their original order.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. **Odd-Indexed Elements (1, 3, 5, ...)**: These elements remain in their original order. Since they are in increasing order, no two elements can satisfy the condition p[i] divides p[j] and p[i+1] divides p[j+1] because i and j are odd and i+1 and j+1 are even, making the condition impossible to satisfy with these elements.

2. **Even-Indexed Elements (2, 4, 6, ...)**: These elements are in decreasing order. Any two even-indexed elements p[i] and p[j] will not satisfy the condition p[i] divides p[j] and p[i+1] divides p[j+1] because i and j are even and i+1 and j+1 are odd, making the condition impossible to satisfy with these elements.

3. **Cross-Indexed Elements (odd and even)**: The only possible scenario is when i is odd and j is even (or vice versa). In this case, p[i] and p[j] cannot satisfy the condition p[i] divides p[j] and p[i+1] divides p[j+1] because p[i+1] and p[j+1] will be of opposite parity (one even and one odd), making the condition impossible to satisfy.

### Conclusion

The provided program generates a permutation that satisfies the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
