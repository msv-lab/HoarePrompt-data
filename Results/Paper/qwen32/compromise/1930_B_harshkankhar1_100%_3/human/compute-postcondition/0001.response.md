The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) in the list `a`. The other elements remain unchanged.

Given the initial state where `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`, the even-indexed elements will be reversed while the odd-indexed elements will remain in their original positions.

For example, if `a` was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, after the operation, `a` would become `[3, 2, 1, 4, 6, 5]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list where the elements at even indices are reversed while the elements at odd indices remain the same.**
