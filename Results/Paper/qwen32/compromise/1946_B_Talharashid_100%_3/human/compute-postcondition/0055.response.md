To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `c` is the cumulative sum after the last element is processed.
- `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `l` is the input list.

The print statement is:
```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. `2 ** k * maxi`: This computes `2` raised to the power of `k` and then multiplies the result by `maxi`.
2. `- maxi`: This subtracts `maxi` from the result of the previous step.
3. `+ sum(l)`: This adds the sum of all elements in the list `l` to the result of the previous step.
4. `% 1000000007`: This takes the result of the previous step modulo `1000000007`.

Since the exact values of `c`, `maxi`, `k`, and `l` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables:

- `c` is the cumulative sum after the last element is processed.
- `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and `c`.
- `k` is an integer that remains unchanged.
- `l` is the input list, and `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

Given this, the output of the print statement can be described as follows:

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where maxi is the maximum of the previous maxi and the cumulative sum c, k is an unchanged integer, and sum(l) is the sum of all elements in the list l)**
