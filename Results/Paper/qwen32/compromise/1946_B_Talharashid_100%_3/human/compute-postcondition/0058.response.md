The code snippet provided reassigns the variable `l` to a new list of integers obtained from the input. This means that the previous value of `l` is no longer relevant, and `l` now holds the new list of integers. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `c`, `maxi`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the cumulative sum after the last element is processed, `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `l` is the new list of integers from the input.**
