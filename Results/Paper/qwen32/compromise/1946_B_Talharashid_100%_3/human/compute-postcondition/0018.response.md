Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the previously processed element. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `c`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and its previous value.**
