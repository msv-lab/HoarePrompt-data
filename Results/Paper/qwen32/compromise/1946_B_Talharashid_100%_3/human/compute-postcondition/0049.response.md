Output State: **`c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0 if `ele_next` < 0 and `c` <= abs(`ele_next`). Otherwise, `c` is `ele_next` and `maxi` is `max(ele_next, 0)`. `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, where `ele` is the third element in the list.**

In simple terms, the variable `c` has been set to 0. The value of `maxi` remains unchanged based on the given condition. The variables `n`, `k`, and the list `l` (including its third element `ele`) remain unchanged.
