The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current values of `c` and `maxi`. Given that `c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0, the maximum of these two values is 0. Therefore, `maxi` remains 0.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `l`, `ele`) are not affected by this code snippet and retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer, the current element `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**
