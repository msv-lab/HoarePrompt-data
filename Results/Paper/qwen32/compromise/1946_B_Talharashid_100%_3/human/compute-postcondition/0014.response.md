The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of the variable `maxi` by comparing its current value with the value of `c` and assigning the larger of the two to `maxi`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `l`, and `ele` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the previously processed element, `maxi` is the maximum value between its previous value and `c`.**
