The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`, which is the second element in the list `l`. The values of `maxi`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`c` is `ele`, `maxi` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, and `ele` is the second element in the list `l`.**
