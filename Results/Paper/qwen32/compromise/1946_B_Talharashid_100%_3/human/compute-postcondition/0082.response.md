The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` compares the current value of `c` with the current value of `maxi` and assigns the larger of the two to `maxi`. 

If `c` is greater than `maxi`, then `maxi` is updated to the value of `c`. If `maxi` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `maxi` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the value of `maxi` after the execution of the code will be the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `c`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers in `l` (or 0 if the last element was negative and `c` was reset), `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`, `i` is incremented by the length of the list `l`, and `l` is the list of integers from the input.**
