Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 1 element. If `ele` is a negative integer and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` and `maxi` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele` and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`.**
