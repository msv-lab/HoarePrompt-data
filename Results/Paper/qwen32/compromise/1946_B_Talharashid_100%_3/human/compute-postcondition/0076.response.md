The code snippet updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current values of `c` and `maxi`. This means that `maxi` will hold the larger value between `c` and its previous value. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `c`, `ele`, and the list `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is 0 if `ele` (the previous element) is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`; otherwise, `c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `c` and `maxi`, and `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. `maxi` has been updated to the maximum of `c` and the previous `maxi`.**
