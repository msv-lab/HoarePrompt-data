The provided code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. The variables `n`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `l`, and `ele` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the current `ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`.**
