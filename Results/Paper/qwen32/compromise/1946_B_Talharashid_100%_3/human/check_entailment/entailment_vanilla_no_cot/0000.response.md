Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to find the maximum subarray sum and then uses it in a formula involving powers of 2, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

The key idea in the problem is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations. In each operation, you can insert the sum of any contiguous subarray anywhere in the array.

The optimal strategy is to repeatedly insert the sum of the entire array if it is positive, or zero if the entire array sum is non-positive. This is because adding the sum of the entire array (if positive) will always increase the total sum of the array, and doing this `k` times will maximize the sum.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_sum = sum(l)
        
        if total_sum > 0:
            # If total_sum is positive, we can keep adding it k times
            result = (total_sum * (2**k - 1)) % MOD
        else:
            # If total_sum is non-positive, we can only add zero
            result = total_sum
        
        print(result % MOD)

func()
```

This program calculates the total sum of the array. If the total sum is positive, it multiplies it by `(2**k - 1) % MOD` to account for adding the total sum `k` times. If the total sum is non-positive, the maximum possible sum is the total sum itself.
