### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to carefully analyze the logic and see if it aligns with the problem's requirements.

The problem requires us to find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, and the result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by calculating the maximum cumulative sum of non-negative numbers in the array and then using this value to compute the final result based on the number of operations `k`.

However, there are several issues with the logic used in the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Cumulative Sum**:
   - The program calculates the maximum cumulative sum of non-negative numbers in the array. This is not the correct approach for maximizing the sum after `k` operations.
   - The key insight is that the maximum sum can be achieved by repeatedly adding the sum of the entire array (if it's positive) or by strategically adding zeros (if the entire array sum is non-positive).

2. **Incorrect Formula for Final Sum**:
   - The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is incorrect for computing the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - If the sum of the array is positive, the best strategy is to add this sum `k` times to the array.
   - If the sum of the array is non-positive, the best strategy is to add zeros `k` times, which means the sum of the array remains unchanged.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases effectively, such as when the array contains all negative numbers or when `k` is very large.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we should:
- Calculate the sum of the entire array.
- If the sum is positive, the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is the original sum plus the sum of the array multiplied by `k`.
- If the sum is non-positive, the maximum possible sum remains the original sum (since adding zeros does not change the sum).

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the logic and the formula used in the provided program, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
