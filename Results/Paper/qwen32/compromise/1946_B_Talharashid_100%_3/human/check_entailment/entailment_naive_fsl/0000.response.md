Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. The program seems to be using a strategy that involves finding the maximum subarray sum and then using it in a formula that includes powers of 2, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

The logic in the provided program is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to insert sums of subarrays into the array to maximize the total sum. The correct approach involves using a greedy strategy to always insert the maximum subarray sum into the array, effectively doubling the maximum subarray sum in each operation if it is positive. However, the formula used in the program does not correctly reflect this logic.

Additionally, the program does not handle cases where the maximum subarray sum is negative or zero correctly. The formula used in the program will not yield the correct result in these scenarios because it does not account for the fact that inserting a negative or zero sum subarray will not increase the total sum of the array.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should use a modified version of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and then use this sum to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations by effectively doubling the maximum subarray sum in each operation if it is positive. If the maximum subarray sum is negative or zero, the program should return the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7 without any modifications.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
        max_subarray_sum = float('-inf')
        current_sum = 0
        for ele in l:
            current_sum = max(ele, current_sum + ele)
            max_subarray_sum = max(max_subarray_sum, current_sum)
        
        # If the maximum subarray sum is negative or zero, return the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7
        if max_subarray_sum <= 0:
            print(sum(l) % MOD)
        else:
            # Otherwise, double the maximum subarray sum in each operation
            result = (sum(l) + max_subarray_sum * (1 << k) - max_subarray_sum) % MOD
            print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version of the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations by using a modified version of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and then using this sum to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations.
