Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to find the maximum number of pages Alice can read by summing the maximum value in all but the last book with the last book's value. This approach does not guarantee that we are maximizing the sum of the two highest values in the two piles.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the two largest numbers in the list of books and sum them. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort()
        print(nums[-1] + nums[-2])

func()
```

This program sorts the list of books and sums the two largest values, which ensures that Alice reads the maximum number of pages possible by dividing the books into two piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages from each pile.
