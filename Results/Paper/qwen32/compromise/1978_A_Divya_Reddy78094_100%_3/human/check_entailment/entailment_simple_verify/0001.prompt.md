You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
        
    #State: For each test case, the output will be the sum of the maximum value from all elements except the last one in the list `a` and the last element itself. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The task is to divide the books into two non-empty piles and select the book with the highest number of pages from each pile to maximize the total number of pages read.

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of books and their respective page counts. It then attempts to compute the maximum number of pages Alice can read by summing the largest number in the list excluding the last element and the last element itself.

However, this approach does not necessarily yield the correct result. The key point is that the program does not consider all possible ways to split the books into two piles and select the maximum possible pages from each pile. Instead, it only considers a specific split (excluding the last element and including it). This is not guaranteed to give the maximum possible sum of the two largest elements from any split of the list.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The correct answer should be 5 (choosing 2 and 3), but the program will output 3 (choosing 1 and 3).

To solve the problem correctly, we should sort the list of books in descending order and then select the two largest values. Here's the correct approach:

1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the number of books and their respective page counts.
3. Sort the list of books in descending order.
4. Sum the first two elements of the sorted list (these will be the two largest values).
5. Output the result for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
