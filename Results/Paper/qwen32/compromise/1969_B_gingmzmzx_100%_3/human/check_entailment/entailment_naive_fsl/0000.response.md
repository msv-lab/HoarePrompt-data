Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.
- Each cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` has a cost of `r - l + 1`.
- We need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided does not seem to implement the logic described in the problem. It counts the number of '0's and '1's and calculates a value `ans` based on the counts, but this does not align with the problem's requirement of performing cyclic shifts to sort the string.

### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Counting Zeros and Ones**:
   ```python
   zeroes = s.count(0)
   cnt = [0, 0]
   ans = 0
   for c in s:
       cnt[c] += 1
       if c == 0:
           ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
       else:
           ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
   ```
   This part of the code counts the number of '0's and '1's and calculates `ans` based on the counts, but it does not simulate the cyclic shifts or calculate the cost of those shifts.

2. **Output**:
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```
   The `ans` value calculated does not represent the minimum total cost to sort the string as required by the problem.

### Example Test Case:
Let's consider the first example test case:
- Input: `10`
- Expected Output: `2` (since we need to perform a cyclic shift on the whole string which has a cost of 2).

The provided program would not output `2` for this input. Instead, it calculates `ans` based on the counts of '0's and '1's, which does not match the expected logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not implement the required logic to calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
