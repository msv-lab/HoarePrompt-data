The code snippet provided updates the list `s` by reading a new input string, converting it to a list of integers, and then mapping each character to its integer value. This means the previous value of `s` is overwritten. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged as the code does not affect them.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the newly input string, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the previous list `s`, `cnt` is [zeroes, len(s) - zeroes], `ans` is the total count of pairs (0, 1) and the contribution of each 1 to the total number of 0s that come after it in the previous list `s`.** 

In simpler terms, the list `s` is now a new list of integers derived from the input string, while all other variables retain their previous values.
