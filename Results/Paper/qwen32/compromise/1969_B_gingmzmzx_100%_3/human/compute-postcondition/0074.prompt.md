Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) with length 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of lengths of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [zeroes, len(s) - zeroes], `ans` is the final accumulated score based on the loop rules.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the input string, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [zeroes, len(s) - zeroes], `ans` is the total count of pairs (0, 1) and the contribution of each 1 to the total number of 0s that come after it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the newly input string, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[number of 0s in s, number of 1s in s]`, `ans` is the sum of 1 for each 0 with at least one 1 before it and the number of 0s not yet counted for each 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
