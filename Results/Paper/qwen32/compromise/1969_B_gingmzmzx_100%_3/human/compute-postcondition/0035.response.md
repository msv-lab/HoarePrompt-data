The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `zeroes - cnt[0]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the input string and must have at least 1 element, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1], `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`, and `c` is not equal to 0.**
