The code snippet increments `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise, it remains unchanged. Given that `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `cnt[1]` will be 1 in one case and 0 in the other. Therefore, `ans` will be incremented by 1 if `cnt` is `[1, 0]` and will remain 0 if `cnt` is `[0, 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the input string and must have at least 1 element, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1], `ans` is 1 if `cnt` is [1, 0] else 0, and `c` is 0.**
