The code snippet provided resets the value of `ans` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the newly input string, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0.**
