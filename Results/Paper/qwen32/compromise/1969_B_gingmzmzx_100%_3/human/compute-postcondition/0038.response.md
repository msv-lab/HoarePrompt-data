The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given that `c` is the next element in the list `s` after the previously processed element, and `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, the value of `c` can be either 0 or 1. 

If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the input string and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [2, 0] if `c` was 0 or [0, 2] if `c` was 1 or [1, 1] if `c` was the opposite of the initial index with a value of 1, `c` is the next element in `s` after the previously processed element.**
