The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given that `c` is the next element in the list `s`, and `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, the value at index `c` will be incremented by 1. 

Since `c` is a binary digit (either 0 or 1), this operation will increment either `cnt[0]` or `cnt[1]` by 1, depending on the value of `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string and must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [2, 0], [1, 1], or [0, 2] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
