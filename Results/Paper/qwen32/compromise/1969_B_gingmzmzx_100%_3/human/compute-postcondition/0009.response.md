The provided code snippet increments the variable `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Given that `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `cnt[1]` can either be 0 or 1. Therefore, `ans` will be incremented by 1 only if `cnt` is `[1, 0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string and must have at least one element, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1], `ans` is 1 if `cnt` is [1, 0] else 0, and `c` is 0.**
