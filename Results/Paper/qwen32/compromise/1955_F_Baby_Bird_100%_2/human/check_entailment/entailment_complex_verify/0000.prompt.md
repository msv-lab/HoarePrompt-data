You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers p1, p2, p3, and p4 (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) denoting the number of test cases.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where each resulti is the calculated value for the i-th test case)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on these counts and prints the results, one per line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

The problem description states that Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins. Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even. Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can observe the following:

- The binary representation of these numbers is:
  - 1: 001
  - 2: 010
  - 3: 011
  - 4: 100

The XOR of a sequence is zero if:
- The count of numbers with the least significant bit (LSB) set (1 and 3) is even.
- The count of numbers with the second least significant bit set (2 and 3) is even.
- The count of numbers with the most significant bit set (4) is even.

Eve's optimal strategy is to remove numbers such that the remaining sequence has an even count of numbers with each bit set.

The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the parity of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. The formula used in the program is:

```python
sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3
```

Let's break down this formula:
- `x // 2` counts how many pairs of each number can be removed, ensuring that the count of each number type is even.
- `x % 2` checks if there is an odd count remaining.
- `* (i < 3)` ensures that the least significant two bits (from 1, 2, and 3) are considered separately from the most significant bit (from 4).
- The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Let's test this program with the provided examples and some edge cases.

### Example Test Cases

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
1
1 1 1 0

Output:
1
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 1 (001) ^ 2 (010) ^ 3 (011) = 0 (000). Bob wins. Eve removes one number, and Alice wins.

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
1
1 0 1 2

Output:
1
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 1 (001) ^ 3 (011) ^ 4 (100) ^ 4 (100) = 0 (000). Bob wins. Eve can remove one 1 and one 3, leaving 4 ^ 4 = 0.

**Example 3:**
```
Input:
1
2 2 2 0

Output:
3
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 1 (001) ^ 1 (001) ^ 2 (010) ^ 2 (010) ^ 3 (011) ^ 3 (011) = 0 (000). Bob wins. Eve can remove pairs optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

**Example 4:**
```
Input:
1
3 3 2 0

Output:
3
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 1 (001) ^ 1 (001) ^ 1 (001) ^ 2 (010) ^ 2 (010) ^ 3 (011) ^ 3 (011) = 0 (000). Bob wins. Eve can remove pairs optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

**Example 5:**
```
Input:
1
0 9 9 9

Output:
12
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 2 (010) ^ 2 (010) ^ ... ^ 4 (100) ^ 4 (100) ^ 4 (100) = 0 (000). Bob wins. Eve can remove pairs optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

### Edge Cases

Let's consider some edge cases to ensure the program handles them correctly.

**Edge Case 1:**
```
Input:
1
0 0 0 0

Output:
0
```
Explanation: Initially, there are no numbers, so Bob cannot win.

**Edge Case 2:**
```
Input:
1
1 0 0 0

Output:
0
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 1 (001), so Alice wins. Eve cannot remove any number to make the XOR zero.

**Edge Case 3:**
```
Input:
1
0 1 0 0

Output:
0
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 2 (010), so Alice wins. Eve cannot remove any number to make the XOR zero.

**Edge Case 4:**
```
Input:
1
0 0 1 0

Output:
0
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 3 (011), so Alice wins. Eve cannot remove any number to make the XOR zero.

**Edge Case 5:**
```
Input:
1
0 0 0 1

Output:
0
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 4 (100), so Alice wins. Eve cannot remove any number to make the XOR zero.
