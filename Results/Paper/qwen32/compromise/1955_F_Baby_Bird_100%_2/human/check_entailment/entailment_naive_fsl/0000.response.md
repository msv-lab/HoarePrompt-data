Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

The problem description states that Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins. Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even. Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can observe the following:

- The binary representation of these numbers is:
  - 1: 001
  - 2: 010
  - 3: 011
  - 4: 100

The XOR of a sequence is zero if:
- The count of numbers with the least significant bit (LSB) set (1 and 3) is even.
- The count of numbers with the second least significant bit set (2 and 3) is even.
- The count of numbers with the most significant bit set (4) is even.

Eve's optimal strategy is to remove numbers such that the remaining sequence has an even count of numbers with each bit set.

The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the parity of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. The formula used in the program is:

```python
sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3
```

Let's break down this formula:
- `x // 2` counts how many pairs of each number can be removed, ensuring that the count of each number type is even.
- `x % 2` checks if there is an odd count remaining.
- `* (i < 3)` ensures that the least significant two bits (from 1, 2, and 3) are considered separately from the most significant bit (from 4).
- The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Let's test this program with the provided examples and some edge cases.

### Example Test Cases

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
1
1 1 1 0

Output:
1
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 1 (001) ^ 2 (010) ^ 3 (011) = 0 (000). Bob wins. Eve removes one number, and Alice wins.

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
1
1 0 1 2

Output:
1
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 1 (001) ^ 3 (011) ^ 4 (100) ^ 4 (100) = 0 (000). Bob wins. Eve can remove one 1 and one 3, leaving 4 ^ 4 = 0.

**Example 3:**
```
Input:
1
2 2 2 0

Output:
3
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 1 (001) ^ 1 (001) ^ 2 (010) ^ 2 (010) ^ 3 (011) ^ 3 (011) = 0 (000). Bob wins. Eve can remove pairs optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

**Example 4:**
```
Input:
1
3 3 2 0

Output:
3
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 1 (001) ^ 1 (001) ^ 1 (001) ^ 2 (010) ^ 2 (010) ^ 3 (011) ^ 3 (011) = 0 (000). Bob wins. Eve can remove pairs optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

**Example 5:**
```
Input:
1
0 9 9 9

Output:
12
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 2 (010) ^ 2 (010) ^ ... ^ 4 (100) ^ 4 (100) ^ 4 (100) = 0 (000). Bob wins. Eve can remove pairs optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

### Edge Cases

Let's consider some edge cases to ensure the program handles them correctly.

**Edge Case 1:**
```
Input:
1
0 0 0 0

Output:
0
```
Explanation: Initially, there are no numbers, so Bob cannot win.

**Edge Case 2:**
```
Input:
1
1 0 0 0

Output:
0
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 1 (001), so Alice wins. Eve cannot remove any number to make the XOR zero.

**Edge Case 3:**
```
Input:
1
0 1 0 0

Output:
0
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 2 (010), so Alice wins. Eve cannot remove any number to make the XOR zero.

**Edge Case 4:**
```
Input:
1
0 0 1 0

Output:
0
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 3 (011), so Alice wins. Eve cannot remove any number to make the XOR zero.

**Edge Case 5:**
```
Input:
1
0 0 0 1

Output:
0
```
Explanation: Initially, XOR is 4 (100), so Alice wins. Eve cannot remove any number to make the XOR zero.
