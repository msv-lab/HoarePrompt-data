Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:

1. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice wins if the XOR of the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the sequence is zero.
   
2. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of any number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR operation is commutative and associative.

3. **Objective**:
   - Eve removes numbers to maximize Bob's wins.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   
4. **Key Insight**:
   - For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero.
   - We need to determine how many times Eve can remove numbers such that the remaining sequence has a XOR of zero.

### Analyzing the Program:

The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence.

2. **Logic**:
   - For each number type (1, 2, 3, 4), the program calculates a value based on the count:
     - `3 * (x // 2)`: This part counts how many pairs of each number can be made. Each pair will XOR to zero.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)`: This part checks if there is an odd count of the number and it is not a 4 (since 4 XOR 4 is not zero, it doesn't contribute to making the XOR zero).
   - The sum of these values is divided by 3 to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the given examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3))`
   - Result: `(0 + 1) + (0 + 1) + (0 + 1) + 0 = 3 // 3 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (3 < 3))`
   - Result: `(0 + 1) + 0 + (0 + 1) + (3 + 0) = 5 // 3 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Other Examples**:
   - The program correctly computes the maximum number of times Bob can win for the other test cases as well.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
