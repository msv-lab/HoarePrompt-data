The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state provides information about `t` and the test cases involving `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these are not affected by the given code snippet. The only change is that `n` is assigned the value of the integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**
