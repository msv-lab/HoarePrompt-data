In the given for loop, the only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which is used to iterate over the characters in the string `s`. Therefore, the state of `ss` cannot be directly adjusted before the loop starts, as it will be assigned the value of each character in `s` during each iteration.

The execution of the loop depends on the string `s`. If `s` is non-empty, the loop will execute. If `s` is an empty string, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `s`. Specifically, `s` must be a non-empty string.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0**
