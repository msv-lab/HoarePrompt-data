Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. Additionally, the current value of `cur` does not have the bit at position `cur_ss` set (i.e., `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`).**
