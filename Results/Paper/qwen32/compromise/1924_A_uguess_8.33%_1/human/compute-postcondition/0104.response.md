Output State: **`cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence; `i` is `t - 2`; `n`, `k`, and `m` are the integers read from the input; `s` is the string read from the input.**

In this output state, the variable `cnt` has been reset to 0. The other variables `cur`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
