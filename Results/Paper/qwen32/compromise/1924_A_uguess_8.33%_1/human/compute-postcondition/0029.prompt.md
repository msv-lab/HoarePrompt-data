Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the input string; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` remains unchanged. `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the previously processed character; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to 0 and `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
