Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5. For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, 1 <= `k` <= 26, and 1 <= `m` <= 1000. The string `s` is of length `m` and consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input, and all other initial conditions remain unchanged.
