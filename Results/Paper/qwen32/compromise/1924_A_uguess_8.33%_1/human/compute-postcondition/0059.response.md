The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the value of `cur` by setting the bit at position `cur_ss` to 1. Here's the updated state:

The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is now 1, while all other bits remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is an integer with the bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1; `i` is incremented by 1; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z').**
