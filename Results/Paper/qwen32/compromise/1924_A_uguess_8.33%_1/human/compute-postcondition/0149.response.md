To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the variables and their definitions based on the initial state provided:

1. **`cnt`**: This is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered in the string `s`. It is an integer and is less than `n`.

2. **`cur`**: This is a bitmask of the last set of characters processed before the loop ends. Each bit in `cur` represents whether a particular character has been encountered. If the `i`-th bit is set (1), it means the `i`-th character (in some defined order) has been encountered.

3. **`ans`**: This is a string constructed as follows:
   - It starts with a sequence of `cnt` characters, each being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
   - Then it includes `tmp`, which is `chr(ord('a') + i)`, where `i` is the highest index less than `k` such that the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0.
   - Finally, it includes `n - cnt - 1` characters, each being 'a'.

4. **`k`**: This is the number of distinct characters in the subset being considered. It is greater than 0.

5. **`tmp`**: This is a character `chr(ord('a') + i)`, where `i` is the highest index less than `k` such that the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0. This means `tmp` is the character corresponding to the highest unset bit in `cur`.

6. **`n`**: This is the length of the string `ans`.

Given these definitions, let's construct the string `ans` step by step:

- The first part of `ans` is a sequence of `cnt` characters, each being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. For example, if `k` is 3, this character would be 'c'.
- The second part of `ans` is `tmp`, which is `chr(ord('a') + i)`, where `i` is the highest index less than `k` such that the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0.
- The third part of `ans` is a sequence of `n - cnt - 1` characters, each being 'a'.

Therefore, the output of `print(ans)` will be a string constructed as described above.

Output: **a sequence of `cnt` characters each being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, followed by `tmp` (where `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + i)` and `i` is the highest index less than `k` such that the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0), followed by `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters**.
