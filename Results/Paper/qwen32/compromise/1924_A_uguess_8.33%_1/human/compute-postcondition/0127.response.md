The code snippet `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`cnt` is 1 or 2, `i` is `t - 2`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input, `ss` is `s[2]`, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. `cur` is 0.**
