The code snippet only initializes the variable `cur` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the input string; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0.**
