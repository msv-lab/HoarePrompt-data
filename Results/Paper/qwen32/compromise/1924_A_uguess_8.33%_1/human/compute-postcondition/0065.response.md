The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ss` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` has taken on the value of the current character in the string `s`, and `i` has been incremented by 1. To proceed to the next iteration, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was the current character being processed.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string and `ss` has just finished processing the current character, the next state of `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is incremented by 1; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` retains its value. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.
