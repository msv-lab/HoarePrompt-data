The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `cnt` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 0 and will be 1 at the start of the next iteration).

The other variables (`cnt`, `cur`, `tmp`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` was not set (i.e., `cur & 1 << i == 0`), then `tmp` is 'a'. `i` is 1; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`**
