The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp` based on the current value of `i`. Specifically, `tmp` is set to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the value of `i`. The values of other variables like `t`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`, `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + i)`**.
