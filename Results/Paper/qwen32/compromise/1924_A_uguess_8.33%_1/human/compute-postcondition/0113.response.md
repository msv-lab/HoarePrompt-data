The value of `cur` is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is 1, `i` is `t - 2`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, and `cur` is 0.
