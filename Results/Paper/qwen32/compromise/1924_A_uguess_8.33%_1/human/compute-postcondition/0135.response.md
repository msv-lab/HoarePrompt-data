The code snippet assigns a new value to `ans` based on the value of `k` and `cnt`. The other variables (`cnt`, `cur`, `n`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.

`ans` is assigned the value of a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.

Given that `k` is the number of distinct characters and `cnt` is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered, the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` represents the `k`-th character in the alphabet (e.g., if `k` is 1, the character is 'a'; if `k` is 2, the character is 'b', and so on).

Therefore, `ans` will be a string of length `cnt` where each character is the `k`-th character in the alphabet.

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered in `s`, `cur` is the bitmask of the last set of characters processed before the loop ends, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.**
