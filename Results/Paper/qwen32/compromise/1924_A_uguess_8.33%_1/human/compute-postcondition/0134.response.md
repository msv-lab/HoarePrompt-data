The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `tmp` to an empty string. This action does not affect the values of `cnt`, `cur`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of `cnt`, `cur`, and the precondition that `cnt` is less than `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered in `s`, `cur` is the bitmask of the last set of characters processed before the loop ends, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string.**
