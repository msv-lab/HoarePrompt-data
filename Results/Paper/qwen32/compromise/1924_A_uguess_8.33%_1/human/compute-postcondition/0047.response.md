Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the input string; `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`; `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`; `cnt` is less than `n`; `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + i)` where `i` is the largest integer less than `k` such that the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0; `ans` is a string consisting of the k-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times followed by `tmp`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `t` remains the same input integer, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged, `s` remains the same input string, `cnt` remains the same, `cur` remains the same, `tmp` remains the same, and `ans` now includes the character `tmp` appended to it after the initial string of the k-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times.
