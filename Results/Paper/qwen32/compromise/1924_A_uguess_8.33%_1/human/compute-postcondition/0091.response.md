The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` sets the value of `tmp` to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 1, `tmp` will be set to 'b'.

The other variables (`cnt`, `cur`, `n`, `ans`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence; `i` is 1; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`; `tmp` is 'b'**.
