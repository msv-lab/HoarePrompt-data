The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is used in the `range(k)` function. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0, as `range(k)` will generate values from 0 to `k-1`.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to adjust only the variable `i` to ensure the loop can execute. The current state has `i` set to `t + 1`, which doesn't directly affect the loop's execution based on the loop head. However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to set `i` to a value that allows the loop to start, which is typically 0, as the loop will iterate from 0 to `k-1`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence; `i` is 0; `cnt` is less than `n`; `tmp` is an empty string; `ans` is a string of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`**
