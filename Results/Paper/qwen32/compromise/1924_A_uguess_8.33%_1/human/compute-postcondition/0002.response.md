The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The initial state only mentions `t` as an input integer, which is not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input.**
