### Reasoning:

The provided code has a flawed approach to solving the problem. The code attempts to count sequences of all `k` distinct characters in any order within the string `s`, and then it decides whether to print "YES" or "NO". However, the problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences of `s`. The code does not achieve this.

Here's an analysis of the provided code:
1. **Counting Sequences**: The code uses a bitmask to count sequences of all `k` distinct characters in any order. This is not the same as checking for all possible subsequences of length `n`.
2. **Constructing the Missing String**: The logic for constructing the missing string is incorrect. It does not ensure that the constructed string is one that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Generate All Possible Strings**: For a given `n` and `k`, generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. **Check Subsequences**: For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
3. **Output Result**: If all generated strings are subsequences, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO" followed by one of the strings that is not a subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
