Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. 

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Counting Subsequences**: The program attempts to count how many distinct subsequences of length `k` it can find in `s`. However, the logic used to count these subsequences is incorrect. The program uses a bitmask to track which characters have been seen in the current subsequence, but it does not correctly handle the logic for forming subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: The program's logic for generating a missing subsequence is flawed. It constructs a string that may not be a valid missing subsequence, especially when `cnt` is less than `n`.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
2 2 3
abb
```

The program should output:
```
NO
aa
```

However, the provided program might output something incorrect because it does not correctly determine that `aa` is a missing subsequence.

### Another Example:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

The program should output:
```
NO
aaa
```

However, the program might not correctly identify `aaa` as a missing subsequence.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not found as a subsequence, print `NO` followed by that string.
4. If all strings are found, print `YES`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_subsequence(s, t):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in t)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        alphabet = ''.join(chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(k))
        found_all = True
        missing_string = ""
        for i in range(k**n):
            candidate = ''.join(alphabet[j] for j in [(i // (k**p)) % k for p in range(n)])
            if not is_subsequence(s, candidate):
                found_all = False
                missing_string = candidate
                break
        if found_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            print(missing_string)

# func()  # Uncomment to run the function
```

This corrected version correctly checks all possible strings of length `n` and determines if they are subsequences of `s`. If any string is not found, it correctly identifies and prints a missing string.
