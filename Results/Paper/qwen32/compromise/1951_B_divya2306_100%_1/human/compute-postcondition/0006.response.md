Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
- The list `a` contains `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and all \(a_i\) are pairwise distinct.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).
- `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`.
- The current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(wins - 1)
```

### Analysis:
- `a[k-1]` is the \(k\)-th smallest element in the list `a` because the elements are pairwise distinct and `k` is a valid index.
- `wins` is the count of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`.
- Since `wins` is the number of elements less than or equal to the \(k\)-th smallest element, and all elements are distinct, `wins` is exactly `k` (because the \(k\)-th smallest element and all elements smaller than it are counted in `wins`).
- Given that `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, and considering the distinct nature of elements, `wins` must be exactly `k`.
- Therefore, `wins - 1` will be `k - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The code will print `k - 1`.

### Output:
Output: **k - 1**
