To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `win_with_swap`, and `k`.

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the `range` function must produce at least one value. This means that the start of the range (`win_with_swap`) must be less than the end of the range (`k - 1`). Therefore, we need to ensure that `win_with_swap < k - 1`.

Given the constraints:
- `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`.
- `wins` is less than `k`.
- `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`.

From the above, we can deduce:
- Since `wins < k`, it follows that `win_with_swap = wins + 1 < k`.
- Therefore, `win_with_swap < k` is always true.
- To ensure the loop executes, we need `win_with_swap < k - 1`. This implies `wins < k - 1`.

Since `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `wins` are already defined with their respective constraints, the only variable we need to adjust in the loop head is `i` to ensure it starts at `win_with_swap`.

Thus, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; The list `a` contains `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise distinct; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` and `wins < k - 1`; `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`; `i` is `win_with_swap`**
