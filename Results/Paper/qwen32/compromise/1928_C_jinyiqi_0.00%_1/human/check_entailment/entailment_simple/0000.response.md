### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the number of possible values of `k` such that a given position `n` in a line corresponds to a specific number `x` when the line is arranged in a repeating pattern of "first-k-th" positions.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Calculating two potential expressions for `k`:
   - `(n + x - 2) / 2`
   - `(n - x) / 2`
2. Checking if these expressions yield valid `k` values by ensuring:
   - The results are integers.
   - The results are greater than or equal to `x`.
   - The results are greater than 1 (since `k > 1` is required for the settling to exist).

The function `func_1(x)` computes all divisors of `x` in ascending order. This is used to potentially find valid `k` values that fit the conditions.

However, there are several issues with the provided program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Divisors**: The program uses the divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` to determine potential `k` values. However, the relationship between `n`, `x`, and `k` is not correctly captured by simply using the divisors of these expressions.
2. **Integer Division**: The program uses `/` for division, which returns a float. It should use `//` for integer division to ensure the results are integers.
3. **Checking Conditions**: The program checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`, but these checks do not correctly map to the problem's requirements for valid `k` values.
4. **Logic for Valid k**: The logic to determine valid `k` values from the divisors is not correctly implemented. The program does not properly account for the periodic nature of the pattern and the constraints on `k`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the number of valid `k` values for the given problem.

### Correctness: **False**
