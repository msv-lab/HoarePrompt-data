You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: For each of the t test cases, y is an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999, where y is the value of x - 1 from the input. The value of t remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `x` and prints `x - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.

### Key Insight

To maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \), we need to consider the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of two numbers is maximized when the two numbers share the most common factors. 

For the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) to be maximized, \( y \) should be as large as possible while still being less than \( x \). The largest possible \( y \) is \( x - 1 \).

### Verification

Let's verify if choosing \( y = x - 1 \) indeed maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \):

- When \( y = x - 1 \):
  - If \( x \) is even, \( \gcd(x, x-1) = 1 \) because \( x-1 \) is odd and has no common factors with \( x \) other than 1.
  - If \( x \) is odd, \( \gcd(x, x-1) = 1 \) because \( x-1 \) is even and has no common factors with \( x \) other than 1.
- Therefore, \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x \).

This is the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because any other \( y \) less than \( x-1 \) will have a smaller GCD with \( x \), and hence a smaller sum.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and then outputs \( y = x - 1 \).

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)
```

The logic in the program aligns with our analysis. For each test case, it computes \( y = x - 1 \) and prints it, which is a valid solution according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
