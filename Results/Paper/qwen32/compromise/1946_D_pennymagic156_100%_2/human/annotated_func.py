#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`. This function reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers derived from the input line, where each integer is separated by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the user, splits the line into components based on whitespace, converts each component into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. This function does not have any parameters and thus no preconditions related to input variables can be described.
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prompts the user for input, converts the input to an integer, and returns this integer value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_3`. This function is expected to read input from standard input and return a map object containing integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers that were obtained by converting each element of the input string, which is split by spaces, into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_4()`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the provided function signature alone.
def func_4():
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns the user's input as a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` prompts the user for input, reads the input as a string, removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the string, and then returns the processed string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, and x is a non-negative integer representing the favorite number. a is a list of non-negative integers of length n.

    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between 'ans' and the length of list 'a'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the maximum value between the number of times a specific bitwise operation results in zero during its execution and the length of a transformed list `a`. It processes an array `a` of non-negative integers and a non-negative integer `x` to determine this maximum value.
