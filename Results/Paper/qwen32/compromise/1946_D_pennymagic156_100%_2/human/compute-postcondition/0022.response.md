The given code snippet modifies the value of `ai` using the XOR operation with `val`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and contains at least two elements.
- `t` is either an empty list or a list containing `ai`.
- `ans` is -1.
- `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0.
- `v` is an even number or 0.
- `op` is 1.

The code snippet:
```python
ai ^= val
```
changes the value of `ai` to `ai ^ val`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and contains at least two elements, `t` is either an empty list or a list containing the updated `ai` (which is now `ai ^ val`), `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is 1.**
