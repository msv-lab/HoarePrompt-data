Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least two elements, `t` is a list containing the element `ai` if `op` is 0 (otherwise `t` remains unchanged), `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0 (otherwise `ai` is unchanged), `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `val` is the next element in `a`.**
