The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `ai`. This does not affect any other variables in the given initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and contains at least two elements, `t` is a list containing the updated `ai` (which is now `ai ^ val`) and `ai`, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is `1 ^ (a[1] >> i & 1)`, `ai` is 0.**
