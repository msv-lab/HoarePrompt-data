Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is either the return value of `func_1()` or a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0. Additionally, `v` is even and non-zero, and `v` is truthy (non-zero).**

Explanation: The values of `op` and `cnt` have been explicitly set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
