Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must be an iterable with at least two elements, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op_original ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `cnt` is 2 if `op` is 0, otherwise `cnt` remains 1, `val` is the next element in `a`.**
