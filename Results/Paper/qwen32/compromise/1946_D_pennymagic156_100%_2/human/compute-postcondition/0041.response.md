The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the result of `val >> i & 1`. Given that `op` is initially 0, the new value of `op` will be the value of `val >> i & 1`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `val >> i` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions.
- `& 1` performs a bitwise AND operation with 1, which extracts the least significant bit (LSB) of the result from the right shift operation.

Since `op` starts at 0, `op ^= val >> i & 1` effectively sets `op` to the LSB of `val >> i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `(val >> i) & 1`, `cnt` is 0**.
