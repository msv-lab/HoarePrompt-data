Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is `max(-1, cnt)`, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is the result of XORing all `(val >> i) & 1` for each `val` in `a`, `cnt` is the number of times `op` was zero during the iterations.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (-1) and the value of `cnt`. All other variables retain their previous values.
