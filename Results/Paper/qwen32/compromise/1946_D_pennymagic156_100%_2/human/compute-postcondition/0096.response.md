Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> 27) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `val >> i & 1` and `op` is currently 0, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `cnt` is 1**.

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `cnt` has been incremented by 1, making its new value 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
