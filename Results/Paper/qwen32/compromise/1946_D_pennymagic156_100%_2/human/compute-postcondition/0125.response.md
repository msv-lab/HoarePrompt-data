Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, `t` is a list containing the element `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains unchanged, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is 0 if the if condition is met, otherwise `op` retains its original value, `ai` is 0 if the if condition is met, otherwise `ai` retains its original value, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged.**
