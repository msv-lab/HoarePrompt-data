The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop structure provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the flow in this context.

Therefore, none of the variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `u`, `v`) are modified by the `continue` statement. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])` and `v` is 0**.
