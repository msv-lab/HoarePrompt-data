Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`. If `u == 0`, then `a` becomes an empty list, `t` accumulates the `ai` values where `op` became 0, and `ai` is set to 0. If `u != 0`, `a` retains its original value or is the return value of `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, and `ai` is the XOR of elements in `a` since the last time `op` became 0 or 0 if `op` became 0 in the last iteration. If `v` (which is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`) is odd, the state remains as described above. If `v` is even and non-zero, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop execution, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. If `v` is even and zero, the loop breaks or the if statement is exited, and `i` is set to 0.**
