To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact new value of `a`. However, we can infer that `a` will be reassigned to whatever `func_1()` returns.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`.

After executing `a = func_1()`, the variable `a` will be updated to whatever `func_1()` returns. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged unless `func_1()` modifies them, which is not indicated in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the output state will be:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `x` remains a non-negative integer.
- `a` is now whatever `func_1()` returns.

Since the exact return value of `func_1()` is not specified, we can only describe the state in terms of the function's output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`**.
