Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a non-empty list containing accumulated `ai` values, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is 2 if `op` was 0 before the operation and the `i-th` bit of `val` is 1, otherwise `cnt` is 1 if `op` was not 0 before the operation or the `i-th` bit of `val` is not 1, `ai` retains its previous value.**
