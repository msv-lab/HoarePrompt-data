### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by determining the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in the array `a` or appears exactly once in `a`. However, this approach does not fully capture the optimal strategy for both players.

**Key Points:**
1. **MEX Calculation:** The MEX (minimum excludant) is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c` after all elements have been processed. The optimal play involves both players making moves that maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively.
2. **Optimal Play:** Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The program's logic does not account for the alternating turns and the strategic choices made by both players.
3. **Current Program Logic:** The program checks for the smallest non-negative integer that is either missing from `a` or appears exactly once. This does not consider the sequence of moves or the interaction between Alice and Bob.

**Correct Approach:**
- **Count Occurrences:** Use a counter to count the occurrences of each number in `a`.
- **Determine MEX:** Iterate from 0 upwards to find the smallest number that is missing from `a`. This number will be the MEX of the final array `c` if both players play optimally.

The current program does not simulate the game turns or consider the strategic implications of each player's move. It simply finds the smallest number that is not present or appears exactly once, which does not guarantee the correct MEX under optimal play.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the MEX under optimal play by both Alice and Bob. It only checks for the smallest number that is missing or appears exactly once, which is not sufficient to determine the correct MEX in all scenarios.
