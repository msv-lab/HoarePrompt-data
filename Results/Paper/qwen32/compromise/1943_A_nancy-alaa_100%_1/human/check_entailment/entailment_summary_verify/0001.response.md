### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided program with a focus on the function summary and the original assessment.

**Problem Recap:**
- Alice and Bob take turns playing a game on an array `a`.
- Alice starts by appending an element from `a` to `c` and removing it from `a`.
- Bob removes an element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score of the game is the MEX of `c`.
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

**Function Summary:**
- The function prints the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in the list `a` or appears exactly once in `a`.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
- It iterates over the range `[0, n]` to find the smallest integer not in `arr` or the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first such integer has been encountered.

**Evaluation:**
- The function summary suggests that the function looks for the smallest integer that is either missing or appears exactly once. This is not directly aligned with the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
- The optimal strategy involves considering the parity of the counts of each number:
  - If a number appears an even number of times, Bob can always remove one of the pairs, ensuring that it does not contribute to the MEX.
  - If a number appears an odd number of times, Alice can ensure that one instance of it is added to `c`, potentially contributing to the MEX.

**Correct Approach:**
- We need to find the smallest integer that appears an odd number of times in the array. This is because such integers will be added to `c` by Alice, and Bob cannot cancel them out completely.
- The smallest integer that appears an odd number of times will be the MEX of `c` after the game ends.

**Given Program's Logic:**
- The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not present or appears exactly once, but this does not necessarily align with the optimal play by Alice and Bob.
- The program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob's turns affect the final composition of `c`.

**Conclusion:**
- The provided program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
- It does not find the smallest integer that appears an odd number of times, which is the correct approach to determine the MEX of `c`.

**Final Evaluation:**
The original assessment is correct. The provided program is incorrect because it does not simulate the optimal play of the game and does not compute the correct MEX for each test case.

**Final: False**
