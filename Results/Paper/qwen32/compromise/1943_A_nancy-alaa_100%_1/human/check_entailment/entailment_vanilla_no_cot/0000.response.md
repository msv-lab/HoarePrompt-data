Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob to determine the final score of the game. Specifically, the program does not account for the alternating turns and the fact that Alice aims to maximize the MEX while Bob aims to minimize it.

The logic in the program seems to be trying to find the smallest missing number in the array, but it does not simulate the game's turns or consider the impact of each player's choices. Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Turn Simulation**: The program does not simulate the turns between Alice and Bob. It simply checks for the smallest missing number in the initial array, which does not reflect the optimal play by both players.
2. **Optimal Play**: Alice and Bob's strategies are not considered. Alice will try to maximize the MEX by strategically choosing numbers, while Bob will try to minimize it.
3. **Frequency Check**: The program checks for the first number with a frequency of 1 after the first occurrence of a number with a frequency of 1. This logic is not aligned with the game's rules or the objective of finding the MEX.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a greedy strategy to simulate the game's turns and determine the final MEX based on optimal play by both Alice and Bob.
