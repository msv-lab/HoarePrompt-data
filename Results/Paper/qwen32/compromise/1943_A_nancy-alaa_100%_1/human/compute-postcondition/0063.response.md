Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- `first` is a boolean variable set to `True`.
- `i` is an integer set to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2 in the initial state.
- The `print` statement is straightforward and directly prints the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is explicitly set to 2, the `print` statement will output the value 2.

Output: **2**
