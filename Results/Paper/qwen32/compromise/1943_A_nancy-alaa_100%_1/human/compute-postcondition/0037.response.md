The code snippet `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the previous value of `n` is overwritten by the new input value. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is `True` if there is at least one element in `arr` with a frequency of 1, otherwise `False`; `i` is `n + 1`.**
