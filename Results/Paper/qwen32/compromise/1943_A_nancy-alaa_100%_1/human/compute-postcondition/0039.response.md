The code snippet `mpp = Counter(arr)` updates the `mpp` variable to be a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the list `arr`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `first`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is `True` if there is at least one element in the previous `arr` with a frequency of 1, otherwise `False`; `i` is `n + 1`.**
