To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.

2. **Logic of the Code**:
   - The variable `i` is initially not defined in the given code snippet, so we need to infer its value based on the provided logic.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, and `i` is set to `n + 1`.
   - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()`, the behavior depends on the value of `mpp[i]`:
     - If `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
     - Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged, and `i` is set to `n + 1`.

Given these rules, let's analyze what happens to `i`:

- The only places where `i` is set are:
  - When `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, `i` is set to `n + 1`.
  - When `mpp[i]` is not 1, `i` is set to `n + 1`.

- If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the loop or if statement breaks out, and `i` remains unchanged. However, since the value of `i` before this check is not specified, we can infer that `i` could be any value that is in `mpp.keys()` and has a frequency of 1.

Since the value of `i` is not explicitly defined in the snippet and the only places where `i` is set are to `n + 1`, we need to consider the most likely scenario based on the given logic.

- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` or `mpp[i]` is not 1, `i` will be set to `n + 1`.
- If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1, `i` remains unchanged, but we don't have an initial value for `i` to determine what it would be.

Given the lack of an initial value for `i` and the logic provided, the most precise description we can give is that `i` will be `n + 1` if the conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement are not met.

Therefore, the most likely value of `i` that will be printed is `n + 1`.

Output: **n + 1 (where n is the value provided in the initial state)**
