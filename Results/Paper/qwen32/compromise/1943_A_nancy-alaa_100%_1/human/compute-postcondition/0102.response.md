To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `i` is used.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n` must be at least 0.
- `i` is defined as `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
- If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Understanding the Context:
The variable `i` is being updated in each iteration as `k + 1`, where `k` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration. This implies that `i` is likely being incremented by 1 in each iteration.

However, the loop breaks if `i` is not a key in `mpp`. This means that the loop will continue until `i` becomes a key that does not exist in the dictionary `mpp`.

### Determining the Output:
Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop breaks when `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the value of `i` that gets printed is the first value that is not a key in `mpp`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact keys of `mpp` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i` that will be printed. However, based on the given information, we can say that the `print(i)` statement will output the first value of `i` that is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`.

Output: **i (where i is the first value not a key in the dictionary mpp)**
