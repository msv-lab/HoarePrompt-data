The code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `arr` and assigns it to the variable `mpp`. The `Counter` object will hold the count of each unique element in `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.**
