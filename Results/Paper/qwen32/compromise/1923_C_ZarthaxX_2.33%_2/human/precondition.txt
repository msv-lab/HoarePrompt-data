The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and q, where n is the length of the array c and q is the number of queries. The array c contains n integers, each greater than 0. Each of the q queries is defined by two integers l_i and r_i, representing the borders of the subarray to be checked. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
