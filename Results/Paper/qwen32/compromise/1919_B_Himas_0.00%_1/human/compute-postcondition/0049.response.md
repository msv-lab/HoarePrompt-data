Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the new input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `i` is i + 1, `P` is 1, `M` is 0, and `q` is '+'**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables retain their initial states.
