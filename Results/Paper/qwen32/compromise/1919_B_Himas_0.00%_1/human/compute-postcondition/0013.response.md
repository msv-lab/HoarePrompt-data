Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `s` is an input integer
- `e` is a string equal to the input value and has at least 2 characters
- If `q` is equal to '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1
- `q` is the next character in the string `e`

Code Snippet:
```
M += 1
```

The code snippet increments the value of `M` by 1. The values of other variables (`t`, `s`, `e`, `P`, and `q`) remain unchanged.

Since `M` was either 0 or 1 based on the value of `q`, after the increment, `M` will be either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a string equal to the input value and has at least 2 characters, if `q` is equal to '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 1, otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2, `q` is the next character in the string `e`.**
