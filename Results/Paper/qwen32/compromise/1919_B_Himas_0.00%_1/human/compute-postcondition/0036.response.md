The only object in the loop head is the variable `q`, which iterates over the string `e`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `q` to the next character in `e`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `i`, `P`, and `M`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted here.

Given that `q` is the next character in `e` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `q` should be the character following the current `q`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is `i + 1`, `q` is the next character in `e` after the current `q`. If `q` is '+', `P` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `M` is incremented by 1.**
