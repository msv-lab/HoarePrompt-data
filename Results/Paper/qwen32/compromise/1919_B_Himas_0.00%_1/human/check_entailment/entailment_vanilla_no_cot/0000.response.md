Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and then prints the difference, which is not related to the penalty calculation process described. 

The correct approach to solve this problem involves dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to determine the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. The given program does not implement any of these strategies and hence is incorrect.
