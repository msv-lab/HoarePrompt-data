Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case and prints this difference. However, the problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty based on the described process of splitting the array and calculating penalties for each subarray.

The penalty calculation involves splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The provided program does not perform any splitting or penalty calculation; it only counts the '+' and '-' characters and prints their difference, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
