The provided code snippet only includes `a = input()`, which means it is reading the binary string `a` from the input. The other variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and the binary string `b` remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The next line contains the binary string `a` of length `n`, and the following line contains the binary string `b` of length `m`. It is guaranteed that the sum of all `n` values does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer. `a` is a binary string of length `n`.**
