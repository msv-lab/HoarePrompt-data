The provided code snippet initializes a variable `k` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. The output state should reflect this change.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The next line contains the binary string `a` of length `n`. The variable `b` is now assigned the binary string of length `m` for the current test case. `k` is 0.**
