The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. The variable `j` and `k` are internal to the loop body and do not affect the loop's continuation.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has some value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n`.

State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
