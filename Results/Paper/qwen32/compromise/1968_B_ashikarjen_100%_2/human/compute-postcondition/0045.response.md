Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m` remain unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` are unchanged. The variable `i` remains 1, and `j` remains `m`. The execution of `break` causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
