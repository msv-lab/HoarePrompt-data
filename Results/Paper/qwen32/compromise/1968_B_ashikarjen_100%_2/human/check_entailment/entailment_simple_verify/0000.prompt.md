You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively. The next line contains the binary string a of length n, and the following line contains the binary string b of length m. It is guaranteed that the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Input:** Two binary strings `a` and `b`.
- **Output:** The maximum possible number `k` such that the prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`.
- **Subsequence Definition:** A sequence `a` is a subsequence of a sequence `b` if `a` can be obtained from `b` by deleting some elements (possibly zero or all) without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over each character in string `a` and tries to find it in the string `b` in order, incrementing the counter `k` each time a match is found.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization:** `k` is initialized to 0 and `j` is initialized to 0. `k` will count the number of matched characters from `a` that form a subsequence in `b`, and `j` will track the current position in `b`.
2. **Outer Loop:** Iterates over each character `a[i]` in string `a`.
3. **Inner Loop:** Iterates over each character `b[j]` in string `b` starting from the current position `j` until a match with `a[i]` is found or the end of `b` is reached.
4. **Match Found:** If a match is found (`b[j] == a[i]`), increment `k` and move to the next character in both `a` and `b` (`j += 1`).
5. **No Match Found:** If no match is found for `a[i]` in the remaining part of `b`, the loop breaks, and the current value of `k` is printed as the result.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program against the provided examples and consider potential edge cases.

#### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  ```
  6
  5 4
  10011
  1110
  3 3
  100
  110
  1 3
  1
  111
  4 4
  1011
  1111
  3 5
  100
  11010
  3 1
  100
  0
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  2
  2
  1
  1
  3
  0
  ```
- **Program Output:** The program correctly outputs the expected results for all test cases.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Strings:** Although the problem specifies that `n` and `m` are at least 1, we should consider what would happen if the input strings were empty. However, the problem constraints do not allow for empty strings, so this is not a concern here.
2. **All Characters Match:** When `a` is a subsequence of `b` entirely, the program should return the length of `a`.
3. **No Characters Match:** When `a` has characters that do not appear in `b`, the program should return 0.
4. **Single Character Strings:** The program should handle cases where `a` and `b` are single characters.
5. **Multiple Matches:** The program should handle cases where multiple characters in `b` can match the same character in `a`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given examples and edge cases. It iterates over each character in `a` and finds the corresponding subsequence in `b` efficiently. There are no apparent issues with the logic, and it adheres to the problem description.

**Correctness:** **True**

The program correctly determines the maximum possible number `k` such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b` for all provided test cases and potential edge cases.
