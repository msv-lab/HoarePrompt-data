You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged, `n`, `a`, and `b` hold the values from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total cost of `n` buns, considering that the first bun can be sold at a modified price `b` if `b` is less than the usual price `a`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `a`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The function handles different scenarios based on the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b` to determine the optimal total cost.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum profit in all cases. Specifically, it does not handle the optimal value of `k` properly. Let's examine the logic in the code:

1. If `b <= a`, then the function correctly returns `n * a` because it's better to sell all buns at the usual price if the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price.
2. If `b - a >= n`, the function correctly calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is the maximum profit when all buns are sold at the modified price.
3. However, the else case is incorrect. The calculation `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` does not correctly determine the maximum profit when `b - a < n`.

To find the optimal `k`, we need to iterate through possible values of `k` and calculate the profit for each. The correct approach involves comparing the profit for different values of `k` and choosing the maximum.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = (b - k + 1) * k // 2 + a * (n - k)
            if profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = profit
        print(max_profit)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This function iterates through all possible values of `k` and calculates the profit for each, ensuring that the maximum profit is found. The original code does not handle the general case correctly, especially when `b - a < n`. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
