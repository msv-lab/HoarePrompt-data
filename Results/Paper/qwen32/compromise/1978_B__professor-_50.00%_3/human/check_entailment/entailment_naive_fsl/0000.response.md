Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum profit in all cases. Specifically, it does not handle the optimal value of `k` properly. Let's examine the logic in the code:

1. If `b <= a`, then the function correctly returns `n * a` because it's better to sell all buns at the usual price if the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price.
2. If `b - a >= n`, the function correctly calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is the maximum profit when all buns are sold at the modified price.
3. However, the else case is incorrect. The calculation `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` does not correctly determine the maximum profit when `b - a < n`.

To find the optimal `k`, we need to iterate through possible values of `k` and calculate the profit for each. The correct approach involves comparing the profit for different values of `k` and choosing the maximum.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = (b - k + 1) * k // 2 + a * (n - k)
            if profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = profit
        print(max_profit)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This function iterates through all possible values of `k` and calculates the profit for each, ensuring that the maximum profit is found. The original code does not handle the general case correctly, especially when `b - a < n`. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
