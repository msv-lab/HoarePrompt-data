Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob sells `n` buns. The first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The goal is to find the maximum profit Bob can make by choosing the optimal `k`.

### Key Observations:
1. **If `b <= a`**: Selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal because the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price.
2. **If `b - a >= n`**: Selling all buns at the modified price is optimal because the price difference `b - a` is large enough to justify selling all buns at the decreasing price.
3. **Otherwise**: We need to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. The profit can be calculated as:
   - For the first `k` buns: Sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b-k+1` = `(b + (b-k+1)) * k / 2`
   - For the remaining `n-k` buns: `(n-k) * a`
   - Total profit = `(b + (b-k+1)) * k / 2 + (n-k) * a`

### Program Analysis:
The program reads `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then determines the maximum profit based on the conditions discussed above.

However, there is an issue with the formula used in the program when `b - a < n`:
- The formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` is incorrect. It seems to be a misinterpretation of the arithmetic series sum formula.

### Correct Formula:
- For the first `k` buns, the profit should be calculated as `(b + (b-k+1)) * k / 2`.
- The correct approach involves finding the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. This can be done by iterating through possible values of `k` or using a more analytical approach.

### Correct Implementation:
The correct implementation should look something like this:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            # Calculate the optimal k
            k = min(n, b - a + 1)
            profit = (b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2 + (n - k) * a
            print(profit)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the misuse of the formula for calculating the profit when `b - a < n`.

**Correctness: False**
