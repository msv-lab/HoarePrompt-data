Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is False.
- `i` is 3.
- `new` is a list containing elements from index 3 to the end of `a`.
- `check_all_new` is True if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`; otherwise, `check_all_new` is False.
- `new_all` is True if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element in `new`; otherwise, `new_all` is False.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'YES'`. This output does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
