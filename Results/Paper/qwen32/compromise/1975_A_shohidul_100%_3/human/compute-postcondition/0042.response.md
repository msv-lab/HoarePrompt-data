Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is True, it confirms that the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is False, it indicates that the list `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.**
