Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`; `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`; `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
