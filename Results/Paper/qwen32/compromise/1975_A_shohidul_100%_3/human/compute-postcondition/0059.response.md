Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; at index `i`, the element `a[i-1]` is greater than the element `a[i]`; `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`; `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`; `new_all` is False. If `check_all_new` is True and `new_all` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken due to either `check_all_new` being False or `new_all` being False (or both).**
