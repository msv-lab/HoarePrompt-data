Given the initial state, let's analyze the variables and the print statement:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`.
- `new_all` is `True` if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) affect the content of the print statement because it is a static string.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
