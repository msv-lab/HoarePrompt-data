To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the given for loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

The variable `i` is initialized to 1 in the first iteration of the loop, so there is no need to set `i` explicitly before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (this condition is unrelated to the loop execution and does not need adjustment).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `check_all` is False (this condition is unrelated to the loop execution and does not need adjustment).

The only variable that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `n`. It must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `check_all` is False**
