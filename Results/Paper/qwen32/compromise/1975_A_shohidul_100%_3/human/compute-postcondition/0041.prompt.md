Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `check_all` is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `check_all` is False. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`. If `check_all_new` is True and `new_all` is True, all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]` and in non-decreasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is False, `new_all` is False, or both, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, no changes are made to `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 2. If `a[1]` is greater than `a[2]`, then `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is True if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is False, `new_all` is True if each element in `new` is greater than or equal to the preceding element, otherwise `new_all` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether the if condition is met or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 3. If `a[2] > a[3]`, then `new` is a list containing elements from index 3 to the end of `a`. If `check_all_new` is True and `new_all` is True, the program continues without breaking out of the loop. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
