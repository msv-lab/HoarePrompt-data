Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, and `new_all` is False. The most internal loop or if statement is broken due to either `check_all_new` being False or `new_all` being False (or both). If `a[i-1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, no changes are made to `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`.**
