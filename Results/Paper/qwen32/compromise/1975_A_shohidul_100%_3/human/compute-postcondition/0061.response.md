To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- If `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from `a[i:]`, `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, and `new_all` is False.
- The inner loop or if statement is broken due to `check_all_new` being False or `new_all` being False.
- If `a[i-1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, no changes are made to `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since `n` does not change during the iterations, it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; other variables (`new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) remain unchanged unless `a[i-1] > a[i]` condition is met.**

However, since we do not know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as follows:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; other variables (`new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) remain unchanged unless `a[i-1] > a[i]` condition is met.**

For clarity, let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is `x + 1`; other variables (`new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) remain unchanged unless `a[x] > a[x+1]` condition is met.**

Since we don't have the specific value of `x`, we can represent it as:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; other variables (`new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) remain unchanged unless `a[i-1] > a[i]` condition is met.**

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
