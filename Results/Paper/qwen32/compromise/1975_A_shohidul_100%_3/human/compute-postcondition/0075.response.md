The initial state provides us with several conditions and definitions about the variables involved:

- `t` and `n` are both greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is a boolean indicating if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though its initial value is not specified).
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`.
- `new_all` is a boolean indicating if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('YES')`.

This means that regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all`, the output of the `print` statement will always be the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **YES**
