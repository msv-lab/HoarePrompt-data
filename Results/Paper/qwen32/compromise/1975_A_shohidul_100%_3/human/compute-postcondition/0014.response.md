The given initial state provides several conditions and descriptions about the variables and their relationships. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values or conditions of the variables described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- The variable `t` is greater than 0.
- The variable `n` is greater than 1.
- The variable `a` is a list of integers.
- The variable `check_all` is False.
- There is a condition that `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- The variable `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.
- The variable `check_all_new` is True.
- The variable `new_all` is True, indicating that all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]` and all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

Despite these detailed conditions, none of them affect the execution of the `print('YES')` statement. This statement will execute and print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values or states of the variables mentioned above.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
