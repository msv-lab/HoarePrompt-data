The code checks if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing each element with its predecessor. The result of this check is stored in the variable `check_all`.

Given that `t` must be greater than 1 and `n` is the length of the list `a`, the code updates `check_all` to `True` if every element in `a` is less than or equal to the next element, otherwise it sets `check_all` to `False`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**
