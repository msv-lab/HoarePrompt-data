Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, and `check_all` is `False` if `a[i - 1] > a[i]`. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `i` is an index where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, and `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end. The most internal loop or if statement is broken if both `check_all_new` (where `a[0] >= new[j]` for all `j` in the range of `len(new)`) and `new_all` (where `new` is non-decreasing) are `True`. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` or `new_all` is `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is also broken. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.**
