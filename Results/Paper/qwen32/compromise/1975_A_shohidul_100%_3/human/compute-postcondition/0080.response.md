Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end; `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`; `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order; and the most internal loop or if statement is exited regardless of whether `check_all_new and new_all` is true or false.**
