Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t > 1`: This indicates that `t` is an integer greater than 1.
2. `n > 1`: This indicates that `n` is an integer greater than 1.
3. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
4. `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
5. At index `i`, the element `a[i-1]` is greater than the element `a[i]`, implying that the list `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order at this point.
6. `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`.
7. `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`.
8. `new_all` is a boolean value initialized to `False`.
9. The current value of `check_all_new` is `True`.
10. The current value of `new_all` is `True`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or conditions affecting the content of the string being printed. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it is hardcoded to print `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
