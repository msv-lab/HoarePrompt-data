The given code snippet calculates whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order and assigns the result to the variable `new_all`. The list `new` contains elements of the original list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.

Here's the impact of the code on the program:

- `new_all` is assigned the result of the expression `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`. This checks if each element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element, indicating that `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`; `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`; `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**
