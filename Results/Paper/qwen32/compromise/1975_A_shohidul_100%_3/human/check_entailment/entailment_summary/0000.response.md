### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its logic against the problem requirements.

1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the entire array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' because no operation is needed to sort the array.

2. **Handling Unsorted Arrays**: If the initial check fails, the program iterates through the array to find the first point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. This indicates a potential split point where the array might need to be rearranged.

3. **Splitting and Checking**:
   - After identifying such a point, the program creates a new sub-array `new = a[i:]`.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`: This ensures that the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the new sub-array. This condition is necessary to ensure that when the two parts are swapped, the resulting array starts with the smallest possible values.
     - `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This ensures that the sub-array `new` itself is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the array can be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix.
   - If either condition fails, the program prints 'NO'.

### Issues in the Program:

The main issue lies in the logic used to determine if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and suffix. Specifically, the program only considers the possibility of splitting the array at the first point where `a[i-1] > a[i]` and does not explore other potential split points. This approach is too restrictive and can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`:
- The program identifies the first point of disorder at `i=1` (`3 > 1`).
- It then checks if `[3]` (prefix) and `[1, 4, 1, 5]` (suffix) can be rearranged to form a sorted array, which they cannot.
- However, another valid split point is at `i=2` (`4 > 1`), where `[3, 1]` (prefix) and `[4, 1, 5]` (suffix) can be rearranged to form `[4, 1, 5, 3, 1]`, and further splits can eventually lead to a sorted array.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases for determining if the array can be sorted by swapping prefixes and suffixes. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
