Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into a prefix and a suffix, and then the prefix and suffix are swapped.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve this problem by checking if the array is already sorted. If not, it tries to find a valid split point where the array can be divided into two parts such that swapping them results in a sorted array.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. **Check if the array is already sorted**: If the array is already sorted, it prints "YES".
2. **Find a valid split point**: If the array is not sorted, it looks for the first point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. It then checks if the suffix starting from `a[i]` is sorted and if the last element of the prefix is less than or equal to the first element of the suffix. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Single Split Point Check**: The code only checks the first split point where `a[i-1] > a[i]` and then breaks out of the loop. This means it doesn't consider other possible splits that might lead to a sorted array.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Validating Split**: The logic for checking if the suffix is sorted and if the last element of the prefix is less than or equal to the first element of the suffix is not sufficient. It should ensure that the entire array becomes sorted after the swap.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
2 3 1 4 5
```
The expected output is "YES" because the array can be split into `[2, 3]` and `[1, 4, 5]`, and swapping them results in `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, which is not sorted. However, another valid split is `[2, 3, 1]` and `[4, 5]`, and swapping them results in `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still not sorted. Another valid split is `[2, 3, 1, 4]` and `[5]`, and swapping them results in `[5, 2, 3, 1, 4]`, which is still not sorted.
