Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the values `v` and `v`, the list at index `v` contains the values `v`, `u`, and `u`, and all other lists remain empty; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 3; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 2; `u` and `v` are now the integers read from the input minus 1.**

Explanation: The value of `u` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `u` is the original value of `u` minus 1. The value of `v` remains unchanged. The structure of `u2vs` remains the same as described in the initial state.
