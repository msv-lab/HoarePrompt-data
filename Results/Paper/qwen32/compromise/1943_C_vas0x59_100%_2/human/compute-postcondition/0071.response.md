To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and understand the operations being performed.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `u2vs`: List of adjacency lists representing a tree.
2. `d`: List of distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices.
3. `a`: Return value of `func_1(d)`.
4. `previous`: List of previous vertices for the shortest path tree.
5. `b`: Return value of `func_1(d)`.
6. `path_ba`: List containing vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order.
7. `ops`: List of tuples that depends on the length of `path_ba`.

### Calculation of `ops`:
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2)]` where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains `2 * ((len(path_ba) // 2) - 1)` tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, where `c1` and `c2` are the elements at the middle indices `ci1` and `ci2` of `path_ba` respectively, and `ci1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`, `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`. The lambda function formats each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` as a string `{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}` and prints them separated by newlines.

### Precise Description:
1. **If `path_ba` is odd**:
   - `ops` contains `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2)]`.
   - The print statement will output:
     ```
     {c + 1} 0
     {c + 1} 1
     {c + 1} 2
     ```
   - Here, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.

2. **If `path_ba` is even**:
   - `ops` contains `2 * ((len(path_ba) // 2) - 1)` tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.
   - The print statement will output pairs of lines for each tuple:
     ```
     {c1 + 1} i
     {c2 + 1} i
     ```
   - Here, `c1` and `c2` are the elements at the middle indices `ci1` and `ci2` of `path_ba` respectively, and `i` ranges from 0 to `((len(path_ba) // 2) - 1)`.

### Final Output:
Based on the length of `path_ba`, the output will either be three lines with the middle element incremented by 1 and paired with 0, 1, and 2, or pairs of lines with the middle elements incremented by 1 and paired with the same index `i`.

Given the information, the final output can be described as follows:

Output: **{c + 1} 0\n{c + 1} 1\n{c + 1} 2 (if path_ba is odd, where c is the middle element of path_ba) OR {c1 + 1} i\n{c2 + 1} i (if path_ba is even, where c1 and c2 are the middle elements of path_ba and i ranges from 0 to ((len(path_ba) // 2) - 1))**
