The code snippet provided contains only a `break` statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the provided context, the `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices in the tree, as returned by the `bfs` function; `a` is assigned the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree from vertex `a`, as returned by the `bfs` function; `b` is assigned the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n`; `n` is `previous[n]`.**
