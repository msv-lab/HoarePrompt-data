Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v`, the list at index `v` contains the values `v` and `u`, and all other lists remain empty; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 2; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `u` has been decremented by 1, making it the first integer from the input minus 2. The value of `v` remains the second integer from the input minus 1. The structure of `u2vs` remains unchanged.
