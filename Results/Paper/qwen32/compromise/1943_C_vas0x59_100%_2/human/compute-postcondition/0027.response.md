The code snippet assigns the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to the variable `n`. Given that `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`, `path_ba[-1]` is `b`. Therefore, `n` is assigned the value of `previous[b]`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices in the tree, as returned by the `bfs` function; `a` is assigned the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree from vertex `a`, as returned by the `bfs` function; `b` is assigned the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`; `n` is `previous[b]`.**
