Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree; `n` is an input integer representing the number of vertices in the tree such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The precondition for `u2vs` remains unchanged as it still represents a list of lists containing integers that denote the neighbors of vertices in a tree.
