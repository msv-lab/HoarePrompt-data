The code snippet appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. The value of `n` is `previous[b]`, and it is not changed by the code. The list `path_ba` originally contains a single element `b`, and after the code is executed, it will contain two elements: `b` and `n`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices in the tree, as returned by the `bfs` function; `a` is assigned the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree from vertex `a`, as returned by the `bfs` function; `b` is assigned the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n`; `n` is `previous[b]`. If `n` is equal to -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
