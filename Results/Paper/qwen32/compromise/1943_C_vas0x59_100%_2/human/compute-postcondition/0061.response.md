Output State: **`u2vs` remains unchanged, `d` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `previous` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `path_ba` is a list with more than one element, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`**

The `ops` list now contains an additional tuple `(c2, i)`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
