Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements; `a` is the next element in `inp` after the previous value of `a`; `x` is equal to `a`; `y` has some value; `ans` has some value.**

In simple terms, the value of `x` is now equal to the value of `a`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
