The code snippet `x = a` updates the value of `x` to be equal to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `x` is `a`; `y` is `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is `a`; `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the next element in `inp`.**
