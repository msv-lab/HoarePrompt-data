Postcondition: **`inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `n + 1` if `a` is greater than `n + 1`, otherwise `x` is `a`. `y` is `a` if `a` is greater than `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is `n + 1`. `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1.**
