The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of the variable `ans` by 1. The values of other variables such as `inp`, `n`, `a`, `a_next`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an input integer, `a` is `a_next` (the integer following the current `a` in `inp`), `y` is equal to `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
