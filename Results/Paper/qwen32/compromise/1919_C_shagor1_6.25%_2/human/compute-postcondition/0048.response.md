Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `a`; `ans` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is greater than `x` and `a` is greater than `y`.**

In simple terms, the value of `y` has been updated to be equal to `a`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
