Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` has a hardcoded condition that returns 0 when `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, which is not a general solution to the problem. The program also does not correctly account for all possible optimal strategies for Alice and Bob.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Hardcoded Condition**: The condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0` is not a general solution and will fail for other test cases where `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, but the array elements are different.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements, and Bob should flip the smallest `x` elements to minimize the sum. The current implementation does not correctly handle the scenario where Bob flips elements after Alice removes some.

3. **Logic for Sum Calculation**: The logic for calculating the sum after removals and flips is flawed. The program incorrectly tries to calculate the sum by subtracting twice the sum of the largest `negatives` elements, which is not the correct approach.

To fix the program, the following steps should be taken:

- Sort the array.
- Alice removes the `k` smallest elements.
- Bob flips the smallest `x` elements from the remaining array.
- Calculate the final sum based on the remaining elements and the flips performed by Bob.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes the k smallest elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob flips the x smallest elements
        for i in range(min(x, len(a))):
            if a[i] < 0:
                a[i] = -a[i]
            else:
                break
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        print(sum(a))

func_1()
```

This corrected program first sorts the array, removes the `k` smallest elements, and then flips the smallest `x` elements. It then calculates and prints the final sum of the array.
