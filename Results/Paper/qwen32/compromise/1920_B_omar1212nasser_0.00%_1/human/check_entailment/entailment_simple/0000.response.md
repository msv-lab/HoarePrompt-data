Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem described but contains a significant flaw. Specifically, the function `func_2` has a hardcoded return statement that returns 0 when `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. This hardcoded value does not correctly compute the optimal sum for the game under these conditions or any other conditions, and it overrides the intended logic of the function.

The function `func_2` is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob play optimally. It does this by considering all possible numbers of elements Alice can remove (from 0 to `removals`) and then calculating the best possible sum Bob can achieve by flipping at most `negatives` elements to negative. However, the hardcoded return statement prevents this logic from executing correctly for the specified values of `removals` and `negatives`.

Since the program does not correctly implement the logic for all test cases and instead relies on an incorrect hardcoded value for certain inputs, it cannot be considered correct for the general problem.

Correctness: **False**
