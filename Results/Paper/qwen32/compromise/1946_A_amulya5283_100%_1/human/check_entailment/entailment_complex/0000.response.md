Reasoning:  
The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The current logic simply counts the occurrences of the median element (or the single element if `n` is 1) from the median index to the end of the sorted array. This count does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
1. If `n` is odd, the median is the middle element of the sorted array.
2. If `n` is even, the median is the element at index `n // 2` (0-based), but we need to ensure that the element at this index is greater than the element at index `n // 2 - 1` in the sorted array.
3. To increase the median, we need to increase the value of the median element (or the elements at indices `n // 2` and `n // 2 - 1` for even `n`) such that it becomes greater than the previous median.

The correct approach involves:
- Sorting the array.
- If `n` is odd, find the median and determine how many increments are needed to make it greater than the previous median.
- If `n` is even, find the two middle elements and determine how many increments are needed to make the element at index `n // 2` greater than the element at index `n // 2 - 1`.

The provided code does not implement this logic. Instead, it counts occurrences of the median element, which is not the correct approach.

Correctness: **False**
