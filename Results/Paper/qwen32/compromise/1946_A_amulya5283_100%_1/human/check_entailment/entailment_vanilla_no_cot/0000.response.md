Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The current logic incorrectly assumes that all elements from the median index to the end of the array need to be incremented to increase the median, which is not necessarily true.

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. The median is the middle element in the sorted array. For an odd-length array, it's the middle element, and for an even-length array, it's the lower middle element.
2. To increase the median, we need to increment elements such that the new median is greater than the current median.
3. The current logic simply counts how many elements are equal to the current median and increments the result by that count, which is incorrect because it doesn't account for the actual number of increments needed to make the median larger.

To correctly solve the problem, we should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Determine the current median.
3. Calculate the minimum number of increments needed to make the median larger than its current value. This involves incrementing the smallest elements necessary to increase the median.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = (n - 1) // 2
            current_median = a[mdx]
            target_median = current_median + 1
            res = 0
            for i in range(mdx + 1):
                if a[i] < target_median:
                    res += (target_median - a[i])
            print(res)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the minimum number of increments required to ensure that the new median is at least one greater than the current median.
