`t` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `t` is `t - 1`. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `mdx`, and `res`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, if `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer, if `n` is not 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**
