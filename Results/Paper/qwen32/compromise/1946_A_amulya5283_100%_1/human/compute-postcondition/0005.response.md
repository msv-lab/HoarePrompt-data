The code sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `a` is now ordered from the smallest to the largest integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
