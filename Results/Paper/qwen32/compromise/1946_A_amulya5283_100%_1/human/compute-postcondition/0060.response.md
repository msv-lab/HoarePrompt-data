To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `t` is at least 0
  - `n` is at least 1
  - `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user
  - `i` is `i + 1`
  - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
  - If `a[mdx] == a[i]`, `res` is its previous value plus 1. Otherwise, `res` retains its previous value.

The for loop is:
```python
for i in range(mdx, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the loop head**: The loop iterates over `i` from `mdx` to `n-1`.
2. **Current state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1.
3. **Condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments:
- Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

### State at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- Other variables (`t`, `a`, `mdx`, `res`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need adjustment.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i` (before it was incremented).

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is `i`, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`**
