Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer input by the user and is not equal to 1, `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is set to 2. Otherwise, `res` is incremented by 1 from its initial value.**
