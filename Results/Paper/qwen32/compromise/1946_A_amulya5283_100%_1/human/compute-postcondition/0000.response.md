The value of `t` is assigned the integer value obtained from the input. The other variables `n`, `a`, and the conditions on their values remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the code snippet provided. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
