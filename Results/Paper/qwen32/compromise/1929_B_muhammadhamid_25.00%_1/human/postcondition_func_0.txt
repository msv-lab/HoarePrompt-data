The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` is 1, it prints 1. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`. Otherwise, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
