### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it correctly solves the problem as per the given description.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is read to get the number of test cases.
   - `r` is initialized as an empty list to store the results of each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, `n` is read to get the number of constraints.
   - `cx` is initialized as an empty set to store values of `x` for constraints of type 3.
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`) to find the minimum `x` for constraints of type 2.
   - `bx` is initialized to `-1` to find the maximum `x` for constraints of type 1.

3. **Reading Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the type `a` and value `x` are read.
   - If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - If `a` is 3, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After processing all constraints, if `bx` (maximum `x` for type 1 constraints) is greater than or equal to `ax` (minimum `x` for type 2 constraints), it means there is no feasible `k` that can satisfy both types of constraints simultaneously. In this case, `0` is appended to `r`.
   - Otherwise, the code calculates how many integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) are not in the set `cx`. This is done by iterating over `cx` and counting how many values fall within the range `[bx, ax]`. The final count is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of such values in `cx`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the results are printed, each on a new line.

### Analysis:

- The logic correctly identifies the range `[bx, ax]` where `k` must lie.
- It correctly handles constraints of type 3 by excluding those specific values from the range.
- The condition `if bx >= ax` correctly identifies when there are no valid `k` values.
- The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly computes the number of valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
