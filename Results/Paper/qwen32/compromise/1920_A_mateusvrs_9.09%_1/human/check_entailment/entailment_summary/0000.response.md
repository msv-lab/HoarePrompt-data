### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step based on the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is read to determine the number of test cases.
   - `r` is initialized as an empty list to store results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, `n` (number of constraints) is read.
   - `cx` is initialized as a set to store values from constraints of type 3.
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the minimum upper bound.
   - `bx` is initialized to `-1` to represent the maximum lower bound.

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the type `a` and value `x` are read.
   - If `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - If `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - If `a == 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

4. **Determining Valid Range**:
   - After reading all constraints, if `bx >= ax`, it means there is no valid range for `k` (since the lower bound is greater than or equal to the upper bound), so `0` is appended to `r`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`:
     - `tmp` is initialized to `0` to count how many elements in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
     - For each element `i` in `cx`, if `i` is within `[bx, ax]`, `tmp` is incremented.
     - The final count of valid `k` values is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` and appended to `r`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the results stored in `r` are printed, each on a new line.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- **Constraints**:
  - `1 3`: k ≥ 3
  - `2 10`: k ≤ 10
  - `3 1`: k ≠ 1 (irrelevant since k ≥ 3)
  - `3 5`: k ≠ 5

- **Calculation**:
  - `bx` becomes `3` (max of lower bounds).
  - `ax` becomes `10` (min of upper bounds).
  - `cx` contains `{1, 5}`.
  - Since `bx < ax`, we calculate the number of integers in `[3, 10]` excluding `5`.
  - Valid integers are `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10` → Total 7 integers.

The program correctly computes `7` for this test case, matching the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
