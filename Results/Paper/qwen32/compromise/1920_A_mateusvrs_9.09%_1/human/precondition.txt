t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each of the n constraints is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. If a = 1, k must be greater than or equal to x; if a = 2, k must be less than or equal to x; if a = 3, k must not be equal to x. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.
