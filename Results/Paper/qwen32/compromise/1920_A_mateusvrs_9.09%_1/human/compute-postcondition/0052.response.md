The given code snippet only initializes an empty set `cx`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `r`, `tmp`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer; `cx` is a set; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` where `a` was 2; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` where `a` was 1. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains an additional element `0`. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx` ≤ `i` ≤ `ax`, and `r` now includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
