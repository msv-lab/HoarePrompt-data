The code updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given that `ax` was initially set to 1000000007, the new value of `ax` will be `x` if `x` is less than 1000000007; otherwise, it will remain 1000000007.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0; `cx` is a set; `ax` is min(x, 1000000007); `bx` is either `x` if `a` equals 1, or -1 otherwise; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input.**
