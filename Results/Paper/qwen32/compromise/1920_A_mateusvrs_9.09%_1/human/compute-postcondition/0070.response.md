The code snippet adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. This means that `cx` will now include `x` if it was not already present. The values of `t`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0; `cx` is a set containing `x`; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is either `x` if `a` equals 1, or -1 otherwise; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input.**
