Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0; `cx` is a set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is either `x` if `a` equals 1, or -1 otherwise; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input. If `a` equals 1, then if `bx` (which is `x`) is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains an additional element `0`. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx` ≤ `i` ≤ `ax`, and `r` now includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. If `a` does not equal 1, then if `a` equals 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` contains `x` and `a` is not equal to 2.**
