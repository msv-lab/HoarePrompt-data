The code snippet updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given that `bx` was initially either `x` (if `a` equals 1) or `-1` (otherwise), after executing the line `bx = max(x, bx)`, `bx` will definitely be `x` because `x` is always greater than or equal to `-1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0; `cx` is a set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is `x`; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input.**
