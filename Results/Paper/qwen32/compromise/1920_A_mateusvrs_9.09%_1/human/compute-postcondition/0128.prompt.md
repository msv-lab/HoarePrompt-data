Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is the input integer; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is -1; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `ax` is 1000000007; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `a` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input. If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` does not equal 1, then `bx` is -1. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`. If `a` does not equal 1 and `a` does not equal 2, then `cx` is a set containing the value `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`; `ax` is 1000000007 unless `a` equals 2 and `x` is less than 1000000007, in which case `ax` is `x`. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x_input` and `bx`, otherwise `bx` is -1. `cx` is a set containing the value `x_input` if `a_input` does not equal 1 and `a_input` does not equal 2. Additionally, if `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x_input` and 1000000007, and `cx` also includes `x` if `a_input` equals 2. `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `a` is `a_input`; `x` is `x_input`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `ax` is 1000000007 unless `a` equals 2 and `x` is less than 1000000007, in which case `ax` is `x`. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x_input` and the previous `bx`; otherwise, `bx` is the maximum of `-1` and `x`. `cx` is a set containing the value `x_input` if `a_input` does not equal 1 and `a_input` does not equal 2. Additionally, if `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x_input` and 1000000007, and `cx` also includes `x`. `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `a` and `x` are the values read from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
