The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `tmp` to 0. None of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `r`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is 0; `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values added when `a` was 3; `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered; `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is 0.**
