The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used for iteration. Since `_` does not hold any specific state that needs to be preserved or modified, the state of `_` itself doesn't change. However, the loop will continue to execute as long as the condition in the loop head is satisfied, which is determined by `n`.

Given that the loop runs `n` times, at the start of each iteration, `n` should be decremented by 1 until it reaches 0, at which point the loop terminates.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would involve decrementing `n` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`; `ax` is 1000000007; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `a` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input. If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` does not equal 1, then `bx` is -1. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`. If `a` does not equal 1 and `a` does not equal 2, then `cx` is a set containing the value `x`.**
