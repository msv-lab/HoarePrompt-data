The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `tmp` was either 0 or 1. After the increment, `tmp` will be either 1 or 2, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is 0; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a == 2`; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a == 1`; `cx` is a set of unique `x` values when `a` is neither 1 nor 2 and must contain at least one element; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is either 1 or 2; `i` is `next_x` where `next_x` is the next element in `cx`.**
