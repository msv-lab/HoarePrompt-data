The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Given the initial state, `tmp` is initially either 0 or 1. After the increment, `tmp` will be either 1 or 2 respectively.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is the total number of iterations; `cx` is a set containing at least one element; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` where `a` was 2; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` where `a` was 1; `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is either 1 or 2; `i` is an element from `cx` that hasn't been iterated over yet.**
