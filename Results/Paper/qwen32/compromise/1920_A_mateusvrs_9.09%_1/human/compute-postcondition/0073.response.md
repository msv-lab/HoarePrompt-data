The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a loop variable when its value is not used), and `n` (the number of iterations). Since `_` is not relevant to the state, we only need to consider `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the number of remaining iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. Since each iteration decrements `n` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `n` should be 1 less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `n` must be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would have `n` decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `cx` is a set containing `x` if `a` is not equal to 2, otherwise `cx` remains unchanged; `ax` is min(`x`, 1000000007) if `a` equals 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is `x` if `a` equals 1, or -1 otherwise; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input.**
