The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given that `ax` is initially set to 1000000007, the new value of `ax` will be `x` if `x` is less than 1000000007, otherwise it will remain 1000000007.

Since the initial state specifies that `a` is equal to 2 and `a` is not equal to 1, these conditions do not affect the execution of the given line of code. The variable `t`, `n`, `cx`, `bx`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is greater than 0; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007; `bx` is -1; `a` is 2; `a` is not equal to 1; `x` is an integer.**
