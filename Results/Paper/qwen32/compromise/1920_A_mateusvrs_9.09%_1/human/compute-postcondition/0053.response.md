The code snippet assigns a specific large integer value to the variable `ax`. This assignment does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer; `cx` is a set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` where `a` was 1. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains an additional element `0`. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx` ≤ `i` ≤ `ax`, and `r` now includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
