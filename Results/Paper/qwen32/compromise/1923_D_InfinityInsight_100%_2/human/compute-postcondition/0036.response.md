Postcondition: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans` at index `i` remains unchanged, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is equal to `inx2` or `inx` remains unchanged depending on the previous condition, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, and `inx` is less than 0.**
