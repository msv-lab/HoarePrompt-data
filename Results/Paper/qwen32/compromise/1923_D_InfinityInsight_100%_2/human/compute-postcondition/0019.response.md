The code snippet appends the sum of the last element in the `left` list and the variable `i` to the `left` list. Given the initial state, `left` is a list with a single element `[0]`. Therefore, the new element appended to `left` will be `0 + i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `left` is a list with two elements `[0, i]`, `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`, `last` is a list of indices where the slime sizes change, with the first element being `-1` and subsequent elements indicating the last index of a change.**

In simple terms, the `left` list now has two elements: the first is `0` and the second is `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
