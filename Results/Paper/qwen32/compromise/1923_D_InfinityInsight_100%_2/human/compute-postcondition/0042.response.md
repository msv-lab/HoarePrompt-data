The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. In this context, none of the variables are explicitly modified by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 4, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `inx` is equal to `inx2` if `inx` was less than 0; otherwise, `inx` remains unchanged, `i` is 4.**
