The code snippet `last.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `last`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3. Therefore, the list `last` will have its current elements plus the new element `3` appended to it.

Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes.
- `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`.
- Each element in `a` satisfies `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`.
- `left` is a list with a single element `[0]`.
- `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`.
- `i` is 3.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is `[-1, i, i]`.
- If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is `[-1, -1, i]`.

Since the exact values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are not specified, we consider both possible initial configurations of `last`:
1. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is initially `[-1, 3, 3]`. After appending `i`, `last` becomes `[-1, 3, 3, 3]`.
2. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is initially `[-1, -1, 3]`. After appending `i`, `last` becomes `[-1, -1, 3, 3]`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`, each element in `a` satisfies `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`, `left` is a list with a single element `[0]`, `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`, `i` is 3, and `last` is either `[-1, 3, 3, 3]` or `[-1, -1, 3, 3]` depending on whether `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]` or equal to `a[i - 1]`.**
