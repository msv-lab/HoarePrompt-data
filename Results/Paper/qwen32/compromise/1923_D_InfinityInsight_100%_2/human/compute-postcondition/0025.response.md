The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, so no adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts. The other variables (`a`, `left`, `ans`, `last`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than 1, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` is unchanged, `last` is unchanged**
