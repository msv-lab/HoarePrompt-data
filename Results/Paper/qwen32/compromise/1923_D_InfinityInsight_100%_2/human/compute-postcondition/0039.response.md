Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `i + 1 - inx`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, and `inx` is equal to `inx2` if `inx` was less than 0; otherwise, `inx` remains unchanged.**

The value of `ans` at index `i` is updated to `i + 1 - inx`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
