Postcondition: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 4, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1` if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`; otherwise, `ans` at index `i` remains `i + 1 - inx`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[4] - a[4] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[3]`, `i` is 4. If `inx < 0`, then `inx` is updated to `last[3]`.**
