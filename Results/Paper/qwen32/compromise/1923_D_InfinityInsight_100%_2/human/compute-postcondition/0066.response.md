Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes, where `n` is equal to the length of the list `a`. The function returns a value `ans` which is computed based on certain loop conditions applied to the elements of the list `a`.**
