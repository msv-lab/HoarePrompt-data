The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `last`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `last` is either `[-1, i]` or `[-1, -1]` depending on whether `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`. After appending `i` to `last`, the list `last` will have three elements.

If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` was initially `[-1, i]`, and after appending `i` again, it becomes `[-1, i, i]`.
If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` was initially `[-1, -1]`, and after appending `i`, it becomes `[-1, -1, i]`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Each element in `a` satisfies `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`. `left` is a list with a single element `[0]`. `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`. `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is `[-1, i, i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is `[-1, -1, i]`.**
