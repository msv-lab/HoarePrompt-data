You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t test cases consists of three integers n, a, and b such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.

        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each representing the result of the expression evaluated for each set of `n`, `a`, and `b` read from the input. Specifically, for each iteration, if `b <= a`, the result is `n * a`. If `b - a >= n`, the result is the integer value of `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`. Otherwise, the result is the integer value of `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` from the initial state remain unchanged except that `t` iterations of the loop have been executed, and the results have been printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic used to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling the buns under the given promotion rules.

### Problem Analysis

Bob has `n` buns, each of which can be sold at the usual price `a` or at a modified price. The modified price for the `i-th` bun (where `1 <= i <= k`) is `(b - i + 1)`. The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal `k`.

The formula used in the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **When `b <= a`:**
   - Selling all buns at the usual price `a` results in the maximum profit.
   - `n * a` is the total profit.

2. **When `b - a >= n`:**
   - Selling all buns at the modified price results in the maximum profit.
   - The sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence `(b, b-1, ..., b-n+1)` can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `((2 * b - n + 1) * n) // 2`.

3. **When `b - a < n`:**
   - Selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` results in the maximum profit.
   - The optimal `k` can be derived from the point where the modified price starts to be less than the usual price `a`. This happens when `b - k + 1 <= a` or `k >= b - a + 1`.
   - The total profit is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the modified price sequence plus the profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The sum of the first `b - a` terms of the modified price sequence is `((b - a) * (b - a + 1)) // 2`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a` is `a * (n - (b - a))`.

### Program Analysis

The program correctly handles the three cases as described above:

- **Case 1:** When `b <= a`, the profit is simply `n * a`.
- **Case 2:** When `b - a >= n`, the profit is `((2 * b - n + 1) * n) // 2`.
- **Case 3:** When `b - a < n`, the profit is `((b - a) * (b - a + 1)) // 2 + a * (n - (b - a))`.

The program correctly implements these cases and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules.
