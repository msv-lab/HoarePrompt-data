Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`, and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to find the value of `k` that maximizes the total profit.

### Key Observations

1. **If `b <= a`:** Selling all buns at the usual price `a` is the best option because the modified price would not yield more profit.
2. **If `b - a >= n`:** Selling all buns at the modified price is optimal because the highest price `b` is significantly higher than the usual price `a`, and the difference is large enough to justify selling all buns at the decreasing price.
3. **Otherwise:** We need to find the optimal `k` where the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price plus the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price is maximized.

### Mathematical Formulation

- **Sum of the first `k` terms of the modified price:** This is a sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`, which can be calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Sum} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2}
  \]
- **Total profit:** 
  \[
  \text{Profit} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - k)
  \]

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the given program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

- **Condition `b <= a`:** The program correctly calculates the profit as `n * a`.
- **Condition `b - a >= n`:** The program correctly calculates the profit as the sum of the first `n` terms of the modified price, which is \(\frac{n \times (2b - n + 1)}{2}\).
- **Otherwise:** The program incorrectly calculates the profit. The correct formula for the profit in this case should involve finding the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit, which is not done in the program. The provided formula \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\) does not correctly determine the optimal `k`.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where `b - a < n`. It does not find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. Instead, it uses an incorrect formula.

**Correctness: False**
