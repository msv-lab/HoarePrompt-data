### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and verify the correctness of the program using the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - **Logic:** If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` to maximize profit.
   - **Formula:** `n * a`
   - **Program Implementation:** Correctly implemented as `print(n * a)`.

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - **Logic:** If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is large enough such that selling all buns at the modified price still results in a higher profit than selling them at the usual price, then it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
   - **Formula:** The sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence `(b, b-1, ..., b-n+1)` is `((2 * b - n + 1) * n) // 2`.
   - **Program Implementation:** Correctly implemented as `print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))`.

3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
   - **Logic:** If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is not large enough to justify selling all buns at the modified price, we need to find the optimal number `k` of buns to sell at the modified price. The optimal `k` is the largest integer such that `b - k + 1 > a` or `k <= b - a`.
   - **Formula:** The profit from selling `k` buns at the modified price is the sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence `(b, b-1, ..., b-k+1)`, which is `((b - a) * (b - a + 1)) // 2`. The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `a * (n - k)` to the profit.
   - **Program Implementation:** Correctly implemented as `print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))`.

### Validation Using Annotations:

The annotations describe the state of the program at key points and match the logic described above. The program correctly handles each of the three cases and computes the maximum profit accordingly.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules.

**Final:** **True**
