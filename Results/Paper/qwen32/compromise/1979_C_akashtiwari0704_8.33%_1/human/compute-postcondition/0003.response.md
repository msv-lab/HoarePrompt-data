The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t`, `T`, and `bets` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `T` is 0, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
