The given code snippet increments the `sumo` variable by the integer value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `sumo`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `T` is 0
- `bets` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is `prod // a[i]`
- `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`
- `sumo` is the previous value of `sumo` plus `a[i]`
- `i` is incremented by 1

After executing the line `sumo += int(a[i])`, the new value of `sumo` will be the previous value of `sumo` plus the integer value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `T` is 0, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `sumo` is the previous value of `sumo` plus `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `sumo` is now the previous value of `sumo` plus `int(a[i])`.**
