In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `t`. The variables `n`, `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` are mentioned but are not part of the loop head. Therefore, the only variables we can adjust to ensure the loop executes are `T` and `t`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `T` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts. Thus, no adjustment is needed for `T` itself since it is automatically managed by the `range` function.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `T` is 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times as intended.
