The given code snippet modifies the value at the index `i - 1` of the list. Given that `i` is 4, the code will modify the value at index 3 (`list[3]`).

Initial State: The list is a list of integers where `list[2]` is 0, `list[1]` is 1, `list[3]` is 1, `list[4]` is greater than 1 and 2 less than its original value, `list[5]` is greater than 0 and `list[5]` is decremented by 1, and the remaining elements are either 0 or 1, with no element greater than 1, and `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 5.

The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` translates to `list[3] -= 1 * list[3]`, which means `list[3]` will be set to 0 because any number multiplied by 1 and then subtracted from itself results in 0.

Output State: **The list is a list of integers where `list[2]` is 0, `list[1]` is 1, `list[3]` is 0, `list[4]` is greater than 1 and 2 less than its original value, `list[5]` is greater than 0 and `list[5]` is decremented by 1, and the remaining elements are either 0 or 1, with no element greater than 1, and `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 5.**
