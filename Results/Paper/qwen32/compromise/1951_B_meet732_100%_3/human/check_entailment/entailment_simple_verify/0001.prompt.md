You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of matches cow `k` can win in a tournament where cows compete based on their Cowdeforces ratings. Cow `k` can swap positions with another cow once or choose not to swap at all. The goal is to maximize the number of wins for cow `k`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of a main loop that handles multiple test cases and a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum wins for cow `k` in each test case.

#### Key Points to Consider

1. **Initial Setup**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of cows `n`, the index of cow `k`, and the list of ratings `l`.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve.
   - It first identifies the rating of cow `k` and initializes an empty list `ind` to store indices of cows with ratings higher than cow `k`.
   - It then iterates through the list of ratings to find the first two cows with higher ratings than cow `k`. If it finds two such cows, it breaks out of the loop.
   - Based on the indices of these cows, it calculates the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve.

#### Issues in the Program

Let's examine the logic in `func_1` more closely:

- **Initialization of `n`**: The variable `n` is not defined within `func_1`. It should be passed as an argument to the function.
- **Logic for Calculating Wins**:
  - The function checks the indices of the first two cows with higher ratings than cow `k` and calculates the maximum wins based on these indices.
  - However, the logic for calculating the maximum wins is incorrect. The function does not consider all possible scenarios for the optimal swap.
  - For example, if there are more than two cows with higher ratings, the function only considers the first two, which may not be optimal.
  - Additionally, the function does not handle the case where cow `k` can win all matches by swapping positions with a cow with a lower rating.

### Correctness Evaluation

Given the issues identified in the logic and the lack of proper handling of all scenarios, the provided program is **incorrect**.

### Conclusion

Reasoning: The program does not correctly handle all scenarios for the optimal swap and the logic for calculating the maximum wins is flawed.
Correctness: **False**
