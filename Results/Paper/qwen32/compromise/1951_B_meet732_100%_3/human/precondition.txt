a is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It is guaranteed that all a_i's in each tuple are pairwise different. The length of the list a is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all tuples does not exceed 10^5.
