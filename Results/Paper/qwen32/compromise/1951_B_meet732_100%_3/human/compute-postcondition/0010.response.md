Given the initial state and the code snippet, the value of `k - 1` is returned. The value of `k - 1` is directly dependent on the value of `k`. However, the value of `k` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. Since the task is to provide the output state based on the given information and the return statement, we can only describe the return in terms of `k`.

Output State: **The program returns `k - 1`**.
