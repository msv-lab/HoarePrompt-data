a is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile for a single test case, 1 ≤ len(a) ≤ 2⋅10^5, and 1 ≤ each integer in a ≤ 10^9. The function will be called multiple times, once for each test case, with the total number of piles across all test cases not exceeding 2⋅10^5.
