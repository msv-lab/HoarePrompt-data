Let's analyze the provided program and the functions `func_1` and `func_2` to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where players remove stones from piles with certain rules. The key to solving this game is to understand the concept of "Nim-sum" and the Grundy number for each pile. However, in this specific problem, we can simplify the solution by observing the pattern of the game based on the number of unique pile sizes and their differences.

### Function Analysis

Let's break down the functions:

#### Function `func_1(a)`

1. **Sorting and Deduplication**: `a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))` creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes.
2. **Difference Calculation**: `a_new[i] = a_new[i] - a_temp[i - 1]` computes the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list of unique integers.

The resulting `a_new` list contains the smallest unique pile size and the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.

#### Function `func_2(a, n)`

1. **Base Cases**:
    - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins.
    - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), Alice wins if the smallest pile size is even, otherwise Bob wins.
2. **Recursive Case**:
    - For more than two piles, the function recursively determines the winner for the remaining piles (`a[1:]`).
    - If the next player to move (determined by the recursive call) is Bob (`winNext == 2`) or Alice can force a win by making a move that leaves Bob in a losing position (`winNext == 1` and `a[0] != 1`), then Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

### Correctness Analysis

The provided solution seems to attempt to determine the winner based on the number of unique pile sizes and their differences. However, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the game's rules or the optimal strategy for determining the winner.

For instance, the base case for two piles (`n == 2`) does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules. The condition `if (a[0] % 2 == 0)` is not a valid condition for determining the winner in this context. Similarly, the recursive case does not correctly handle the game's state transitions.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner based on the problem description and the optimal strategy for the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
