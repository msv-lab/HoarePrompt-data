### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to see if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The game involves multiple piles of stones, and players take turns removing the same number of stones from each nonempty pile. The player who cannot make a move loses. The goal is to determine if Alice (the first player) can win if both players play optimally.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: `func_1` seems to transform the list of pile sizes into a list of differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
- **Execution Summary**: It first creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes (`a_new`), then modifies `a_new` so that each element (except the first) is the difference between itself and the previous element in the sorted list of unique pile sizes.
- **Issue**: This transformation does not directly help in determining the winner of the game. The differences between unique pile sizes do not provide a straightforward way to determine the winning strategy.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: `func_2` is supposed to determine the winner based on the transformed list and the number of piles.
- **Execution Summary**:
  - If there is only one pile, Alice wins (`return 1`).
  - If there are two piles, Alice wins if the first pile size is even (`return 1`), otherwise Bob wins (`return 2`).
  - For more than two piles, it recursively determines the winner for the remaining piles (`a[1:]`).
  - The current player wins if the next player loses (`winNext == 2`) or if the next player wins but the current pile size is not 1 (`winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1`).
- **Issue**: The logic in `func_2` does not correctly handle the game's rules. The recursive strategy and the conditions for winning do not align with the actual game mechanics.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the winner, one should use the concept of the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero, the position is losing for the player about to move (Bob wins if both play optimally); otherwise, it is winning (Alice wins).

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not implement the correct logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
