### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM. The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm". It then converts this time to the 12-hour format and prints it.

The conversion logic is implemented using a series of `if-elif` statements that check the value of the hour (`h`) and determine the corresponding 12-hour format and period (AM/PM). Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Correct Conversion of Hours**:
   - Hours from '01' to '11' are directly mapped to the same values in the 12-hour format with "AM".
   - Hours from '13' to '23' are converted to '01' to '11' respectively in the 12-hour format with "PM".
   - '12' remains '12' in the 12-hour format with "PM".
   - '00' is converted to '12' in the 12-hour format with "AM".

2. **Handling Leading Zeros**:
   - The minutes (`m`) are directly taken from the input and printed as is, which means leading zeros are preserved.
   - The hours (`h1`) are also correctly formatted to maintain leading zeros when necessary.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The output is formatted as "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" without any extra spaces or characters, which matches the required output format.

### Issues:
- The program correctly handles all edge cases, including the conversion of '00:00' to '12:00 AM' and '12:00' to '12:00 PM'.
- The use of `map(str, input().split(':'))` is correct for splitting the input string into hour and minute components.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM and adheres to the specified output format. There are no logical errors or issues with the conversion or formatting.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
