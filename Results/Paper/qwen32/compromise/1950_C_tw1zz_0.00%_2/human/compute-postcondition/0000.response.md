In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. This means the loop will run `int(input())` times. To ensure the loop executes, the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer.

Given the state before the loop starts is `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` matches this condition. Since `t` already satisfies this condition, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is `t`.

Since the loop head only involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, and we can't directly adjust the input to `input()`, we can only ensure that the state before the loop starts is consistent with what the loop expects.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is indeed the value that will be read by `int(input())`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and `input()` will return `t` as a string**
