You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts is a non-negative integer, universals is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(extroverts, universals):
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None
            #The program returns None
        #State: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer that is not divisible by 3, and `universals` is a non-negative integer. Additionally, `extroverts % 3 + universals` is greater than or equal to 3.
    #State: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer, and `universals` is a non-negative integer. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, then `extroverts % 3 + universals` is greater than or equal to 3.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, which are non-negative integers. If a specific condition is met (not detailed in the output description), the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
