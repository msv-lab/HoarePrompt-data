To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop's header. The loop iterates over tuples `(w, x, y, z)` generated by `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of \(n+2\) integers starting with \(-1000000000.0\), followed by the original \(n\) integers, and ending with \(2000000000.0\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
- `b` is a list `[0, 0, v, v]` or `[0, 0, 1, 1]` or `[0, 0, v, 1]` or `[0, 0, 1, v]`, where \(v = y - x\).

In the loop, the variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated as follows:
- `w` takes the value of the current element in `a`.
- `x` takes the value of the next element in `a`.
- `y` takes the value of the element after the next in `a`.
- `z` takes the value of the element after `y` in `a`.

At the end of each iteration, the indices for `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` shift by one position forward in the list `a`.

### Analysis:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` were assigned values from `a`, `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]` respectively.
- For the next iteration, these variables need to be updated to the next set of values in the list `a`.

### Adjustment:
- Since the loop uses `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])`, the next iteration will take the next set of four consecutive elements from `a`.
- Therefore, `w` should be the next element after the current `x`, `x` should be the next element after the current `y`, `y` should be the next element after the current `z`, and `z` should be the next element after the current `z + 1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated indices for `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n+2\) integers starting with \(-1000000000.0\), followed by the original \(n\) integers, and ending with \(2000000000.0\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `b` is a list `[0, 0, v, v]` or `[0, 0, 1, 1]` or `[0, 0, v, 1]` or `[0, 0, 1, v]`, where \(v = y - x\)**.

Since the loop updates the indices automatically through `zip`, no explicit adjustment is needed for `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` other than ensuring the list `a` remains unchanged and the loop continues to iterate over it correctly.

Thus, the state remains essentially the same except for the implicit update of the loop variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` to the next set of values in `a`.
