To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of \(n+2\) integers starting with \(-1000000000.0\), followed by the original \(n\) integers, and ending with \(2000000000.0\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
- `b` is a list `[0, 0, v, v]` or `[0, 0, 1, 1]` or `[0, 0, v, 1]` or `[0, 0, 1, v]`, where \(v = y - x\).

The code appends two new elements to the list `b`. These elements are calculated based on the existing elements of `b` and the values of `v`, `x`, `w`, `y`, and `z`.

Let's break down the calculations:
1. `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`: This means the second last element of `b` plus `v` raised to the power of 1 if `v > x - w`, otherwise 0.
2. `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`: This means the last element of `b` plus `v` raised to the power of 1 if `v > z - y`, otherwise 0.

Since the exact values of `x`, `w`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, we can only express the new elements of `b` in terms of these variables.

Thus, the new elements added to `b` are:
- `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`
- `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`

Therefore, the updated list `b` will be:
\[ b = [0, 0, v, v, b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)] \]

Given the initial forms of `b`, the specific values of the last two elements will depend on the conditions `v > x - w` and `v > z - y`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n+2\) integers starting with \(-1000000000.0\), followed by the original \(n\) integers, and ending with \(2000000000.0\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `b` is a list `[0, 0, v, v, b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)]`, where \(v = y - x\)**.
