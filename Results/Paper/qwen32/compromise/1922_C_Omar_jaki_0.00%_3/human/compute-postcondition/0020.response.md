The value of `u` is decremented by 1. Given that `u` must be a truthy value initially, after decrementing, `u` will still be truthy unless it was equal to 1 before the operation, in which case it would become 0 (falsy). However, since the precondition specifies `u` must be truthy, we assume `u` was greater than 1.

The list `[0, 0, v1, v2, ..., vk]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`[0, 0, v1, v2, ..., vk]; u` is a truthy value decreased by 1**.
