Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list that contains values from `r` followed by `2000000000.0`.
- `u` is a non-zero value returned by `r()` minus 2.
- `t` is `False`.
- `b` is a list `[0, 0, accumulated_values_based_on_conditions]`.
- `c` is `return_value_1`.
- `d` is `return_value_2`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `b`**: 
   - `b` is defined as `[0, 0, accumulated_values_based_on_conditions]`.
   - This means `b` has at least three elements: `b[0] = 0`, `b[1] = 0`, and `b[2]` is some accumulated value.

2. **Indices Calculation**:
   - The print statement accesses `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]`.
   - Since `b` only has three elements, valid indices are 0, 1, and 2.

3. **Possible Values of `c` and `d`**:
   - Given that `b` has three elements, `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` must result in 0, 1, or 2.
   - Let's consider the possible values:
     - If `c = 1`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 1`.
     - If `c = 2`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 3` (which is out of bounds).
     - Similarly, if `d = 1`, then `d * 2 - 1 = 1`.
     - If `d = 2`, then `d * 2 - 1 = 3` (which is out of bounds).

4. **Valid Indices**:
   - Since `c` and `d` must be such that `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` are valid indices for `b`, the only feasible values are `c = 1` and `d = 1`.

5. **Calculation**:
   - If `c = 1` and `d = 1`, then `b[c * 2 - 1] = b[1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1] = b[1]`.
   - Both `b[1]` and `b[1]` are `0` according to the definition of `b`.

6. **Result**:
   - The expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` simplifies to `0 - 0`, which equals `0`.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the structure of the list `b`, the print statement will always output `0` when `c` and `d` are such that they point to valid indices within `b`.

Output: **0**
