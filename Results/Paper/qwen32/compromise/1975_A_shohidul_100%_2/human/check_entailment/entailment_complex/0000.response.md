### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the entire array `a` is already non-decreasing using the condition `check_all`. If `check_all` is `True`, it means the array is already sorted, and the code correctly prints "YES".

2. **Splitting and Checking**: If the array is not initially sorted, the code iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. At this point, it considers the possibility of splitting the array into two parts:
   - `new = a[i:]` (the suffix starting from the point where the order breaks)
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: All elements in `new` should be less than or equal to `a[0]` (the first element of the original array).
     - `new_all`: The `new` array itself should be non-decreasing.
   
   If both conditions are satisfied, the code prints "YES" because it means that by swapping the prefix and suffix, the array can be made non-decreasing.

3. **Break Statement**: The `break` statement ensures that once a valid split is found, the code does not continue checking further splits. If no valid split is found after the loop, the code prints "NO".

### Issues in the Code:

The main issue with the code lies in the handling of the `break` statements and the logic when no valid split is found. Specifically:

- If the code finds an invalid split, it immediately prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop. This means it does not check other possible splits that might be valid.
- The logic for checking splits should allow for multiple checks until a valid split is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

### Corrected Logic:

To fix the code, we need to ensure that we check all possible splits before concluding that the array cannot be sorted by swapping prefixes and suffixes. Here is the corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already sorted
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Try all possible splits
        found_valid_split = False
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                if all(a[0] >= new[j] for j in range(len(new))) and all(new[j - 1] <= new[j] for j in range(1, len(new))):
                    found_valid_split = True
                    break
        
        if found_valid_split:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

#State: `t` is the number of iterations completed; `n` is the integer from the last iteration; `a` is the list of integers from the last iteration; the loop has printed "YES" or "NO" for each of the `t` iterations.
```

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the original code does not correctly handle all possible splits and may incorrectly conclude that the array cannot be sorted by swapping prefixes and suffixes.

**Correctness: False**
