The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list `a` can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is both non-decreasing and less than or equal to the first element of the list. It prints "YES" if such a split exists and "NO" otherwise.
