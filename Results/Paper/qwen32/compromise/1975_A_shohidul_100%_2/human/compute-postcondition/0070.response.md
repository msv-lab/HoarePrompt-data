Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `new` is `a[i:]`, `check_all_new` indicates whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, `new_all` indicates whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited regardless of the condition `check_all_new and new_all`.**
