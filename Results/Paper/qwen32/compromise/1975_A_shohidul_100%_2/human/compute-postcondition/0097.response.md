Given the initial state, let's break down the context and determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
2. `n` is an integer greater than 1.
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each element `a_i` is between 1 and 1,000,000 inclusive.
4. `check_all` is a boolean flag that is `True` if the list `a` was sorted in non-decreasing order up to the point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. Otherwise, it is `False`.
5. At the current index `i`, `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]`, indicating a point where the list stops being sorted in non-decreasing order.
6. `_` is incremented by 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
7. `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list.
8. Either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (these variables are also not used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. This output does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It is a constant string.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
