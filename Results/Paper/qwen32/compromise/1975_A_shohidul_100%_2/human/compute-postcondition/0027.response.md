The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of any other variables or conditions in the program. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`), but none of these affect the execution of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
