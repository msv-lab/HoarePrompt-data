The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads a new integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the original value of `n` provided by the user input is replaced by a new value. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `check_all`, and `_`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the new integer provided by user input; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; `_` is incremented by 1**.
