Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (This variable does not affect the print statement directly).
- `n`: Greater than 1 (This indicates that the list `a` contains more than one element).
- `a`: A list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.
- `check_all`: Set to `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order. This means there is at least one index `i` such that `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
- `new`: A list of integers starting from `a[i]` to the end of `a`. This list is derived from the point where the list `a` stops being sorted.
- `check_all_new`: Set to `True` because `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`. This implies that the first element of `a` is larger than or equal to all elements in the sublist `new`.
- `new_all`: Set to `True` because `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This means that within the sublist `new`, the elements are in ascending order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) are used in the print statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
