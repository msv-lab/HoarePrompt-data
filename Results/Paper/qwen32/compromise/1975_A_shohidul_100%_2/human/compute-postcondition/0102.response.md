The code snippet creates a new list `new` that contains all elements of the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list. This means that `new` will be a sublist of `a` starting from the `i`-th element.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes its value due to the execution of the code is `new`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `_`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; `_` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting at index `i` to the end of `a`.**
