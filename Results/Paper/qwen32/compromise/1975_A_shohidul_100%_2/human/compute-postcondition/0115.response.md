Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (This seems to be related to the number of test cases but does not affect the current print statement directly).
- `n`: Greater than 1 (the length of the list `a`).
- `a`: A list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.
- `_`: Incremented by 1 (This variable is not used in the provided print statement, so it doesn't affect the output).
- `i`: `i + 1` (This indicates that `i` is being incremented, but without knowing the initial value of `i`, we can't determine its exact value here).
- `new`: A list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of the list (`new = a[i:]`).
- `check_all_new`: A boolean value that is True if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise False.
- `new_all`: A boolean value that is True if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise False.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The provided print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) are used in this print statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
