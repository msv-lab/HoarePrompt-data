Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`.
- `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains only one line, which is a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. This print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`, the output will always be `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
