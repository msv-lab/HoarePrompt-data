To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step by step.

The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it does the following:
1. It calls `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` and stores the result in `ans1`.
2. If `ans1` is '<', it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
3. If `ans1` is '=', it calls `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` and stores the result in `ans2`.
   - If `ans2` is '>', it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.

The key to understanding the output state is to understand the behavior of `func_1`. However, since `func_1` is not defined, we need to infer its behavior based on the context provided.

Given the context, `func_1` likely compares elements in the permutation `p` based on the indices provided. Here's a plausible interpretation:
- `func_1(a, b, c, d)` might be comparing `p[a]` with `p[d]` or some combination of elements at these indices.

Let's consider the possible outcomes:
- If `ans1` is '<', it means `p[max_item_idx]` is less than `p[i]`, so `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.
- If `ans1` is '=', it means `p[max_item_idx]` is equal to `p[i]`, and then `ans2` is checked.
  - If `ans2` is '>', it means `p[pair_idx]` is greater than `p[i]`, but since `pair_idx` is initially `max_item_idx` and `p[max_item_idx]` is equal to `p[i]`, this condition is unlikely to be true unless there's a specific rule or context we're missing. However, if we assume `func_1` is consistent with the usual comparison logic, `ans2` being '>' would imply `p[i]` is smaller than `p[pair_idx]`, which contradicts `p[max_item_idx]` being equal to `p[i]`. Thus, `pair_idx` remains unchanged in this case.

Given these points, the loop essentially finds the index of the maximum element in the permutation `p` that is encountered during the iterations. Since `max_item_idx` is initially the index of the maximum element, and the loop only updates `pair_idx` if it finds a greater element (which it won't since `max_item_idx` is already the maximum), `pair_idx` will remain equal to `max_item_idx`.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **max_item_idx is the index of the maximum element in the permutation p; pair_idx is equal to max_item_idx.**
