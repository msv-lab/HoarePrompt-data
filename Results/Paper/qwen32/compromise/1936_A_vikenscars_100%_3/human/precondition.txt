t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and there exists a permutation p of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function `ask(a, b, c, d)` is used to query the comparison between (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d) for indices a, b, c, d where 0 <= a, b, c, d < n. The total number of queries across all test cases does not exceed 3n.
