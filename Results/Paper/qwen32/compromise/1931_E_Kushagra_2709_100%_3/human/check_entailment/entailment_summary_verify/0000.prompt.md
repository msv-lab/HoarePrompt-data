You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, nums):

    tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

#Function 2:
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        tot += 1
    return tot



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts an integer `num` within the range 1 to 1,000,000,000 and returns the count of trailing zeros in its string representation.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the game rules and logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Anna's Move**: The code does not correctly simulate Anna's move of reversing the digits of an element. The function `zerocnts` only counts the trailing zeros, which is not what Anna's move should do. Anna's move involves reversing the entire number, removing any leading zeros, and then considering the new number.

2. **Sasha's Move**: The code does not simulate Sasha's move of concatenating two numbers in any order. Instead, it only considers the total length of the numbers and the count of trailing zeros, which does not account for the actual value of the concatenated numbers.

3. **Game Logic**: The code does not correctly determine the winner based on the value of the final number after all moves. It only checks if the total length of the numbers minus the trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, which is not a correct way to determine the winner.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Anna can reverse either 14 to 41 or 2 to 2.
- If Anna reverses 14 to 41, Sasha can concatenate 41 and 2 to get 412, which is greater than 10^2 = 100.
- If Anna reverses 2 to 2, Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than 10^2 = 100.
- In both cases, Sasha wins.

**Actual Output of the Code:**
The code will not correctly simulate the game and will likely output "Anna" for this input, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
