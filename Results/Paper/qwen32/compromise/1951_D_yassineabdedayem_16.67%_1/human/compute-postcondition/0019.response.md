The given code snippet updates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the values of `n` and `k`. Since `n` is initially equal to `k`, the calculations for `Min` and `Max` will be as follows:

- `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`. Since `n` is equal to `k`, `n // k` is 1. Therefore, `Min` becomes `min(1, k)`, which is 1.
- `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`. Since `n` is equal to `k`, `int(n / k)` is 1. Therefore, `Max` becomes `max(1, k)`, which is `k`.

The other variables (`t`, `rep`, `tab`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is `k`**.
