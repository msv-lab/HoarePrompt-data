To determine the output state, we need to calculate the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the given initial state values.

Given:
- `n` is 10
- `k` is 5

The code snippet is:
```python
Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
```

First, let's calculate `n // k`:
- `n // k` is `10 // 5` which equals `2`.

Next, let's calculate `int(n / k)`:
- `n / k` is `10 / 5` which equals `2.0`. Converting `2.0` to an integer using `int()` gives `2`.

Now, we can determine `Min` and `Max`:
- `Min` is the minimum of `2` and `5`, which is `2`.
- `Max` is the maximum of `2` and `5`, which is `5`.

The other variables (`t`, `rep`, `tab`, `number`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is 10, `k` is 5, `rep` is 0, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is 0, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5**.
