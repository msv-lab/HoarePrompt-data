The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `Min * Max` from it. Given that `Min` is 1 and `Max` is 5, `Min * Max` equals 5. Therefore, `n` is updated from 5 to 0. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is `['5', '5']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 5, `k` is 0, `number` is 5**
