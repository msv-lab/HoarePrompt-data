The provided initial state does not include a definition for the variable `i`. This variable is referenced in the `print` statement but does not have a known explicit value or formula based on the given information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` from the given precondition.

Since `i` is not defined, we cannot provide a precise description of what will be printed. However, if we assume that `i` is intended to be defined elsewhere in the code (which is not shown here), the output would simply be the value of `i` followed by a space, as specified by the `end=' '` argument in the `print` statement.

Given the lack of information about `i`, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
