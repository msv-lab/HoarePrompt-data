The code snippet assigns the value of `Max` to the variable `number`. Given the initial state, `Max` is equal to `k`. Therefore, `number` will now hold the value of `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is `k`, `number` is `k`**.
