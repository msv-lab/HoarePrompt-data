The code reads a line from standard input, splits it into two parts, converts these parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The previous value of `n` (which was 0) is overwritten, and the previous value of `k` (which was a non-negative integer) is also overwritten with the new value read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `rep` is the number of iterations the loop executed (<= 60), and `tab` is a list containing `rep` string representations of the values of numbers calculated in each iteration.**
