The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is a literal string and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.
3. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
