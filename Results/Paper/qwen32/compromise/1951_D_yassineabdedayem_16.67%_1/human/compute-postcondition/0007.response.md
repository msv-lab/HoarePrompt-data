The code calculates the minimum and maximum values between `n // k` and `k`. Given that `n` is equal to `k`, `n // k` will be 1. Therefore, the minimum value (`Min`) will be 1, and the maximum value (`Max`) will be `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is 1, `Max` is `k`**.
