The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab` and the variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last element of `tab` ('5'), and `tab` is ['5', '5']. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the next element in the iteration process, which means it should be the first element of `tab` since the loop is just starting.

State: **`k` is 0, `t` is 1, `n` is 0, `rep` is 2, `tab` is ['5', '5'], `number` is 5, `i` is '5'**
