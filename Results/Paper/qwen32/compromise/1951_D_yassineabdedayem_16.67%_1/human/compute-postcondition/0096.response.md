Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1` (This is not providing a specific value for `t`, but rather a relationship. Since we don't have the original value of `t`, we can ignore this for the print statement.)
- `n` is `0`
- `k` is `0`
- `rep` is `1`
- `tab` is `['5', '6']`
- `number` is `5`
- `i` is `'6'`

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given the value `'6'`.
- The `print` function is used to output the value of `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of `i`, which is `'6'`, followed by a space.

### Output:
Output: **6 ** (where the double asterisks `**` indicate the actual output, and the space after `6` is represented by ` `)
