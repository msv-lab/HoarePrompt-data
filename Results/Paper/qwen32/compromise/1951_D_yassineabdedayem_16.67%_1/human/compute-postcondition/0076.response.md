The code appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`. After the code executes, `tab` will have an additional element, which is the string representation of `number`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing either ['2', str(number)] or ['5', str(number)], `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `n // k` and `k`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - Min` and `number` is `Max`.**

In simpler terms: The list `tab` now includes an additional element, which is the string version of `number`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
