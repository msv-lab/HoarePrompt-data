To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the variables and their values based on the given initial state.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations that are supposed to be processed, but it does not directly influence the length of `tab` in this specific print statement.
- `n` and `k` are both initialized to 0. These variables are not directly used in the print statement.
- `rep` is the number of iterations the loop executed, and it is specified to be less than or equal to 60. This variable indicates how many times a loop has run.
- `tab` is a list that contains the string representations of values calculated in each iteration of the loop. The length of `tab` is directly related to the number of iterations the loop has executed, which is represented by `rep`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(len(tab))
```
This statement will print the length of the list `tab`. Since `tab` is populated during the loop iterations and `rep` is the count of these iterations, the length of `tab` will be equal to `rep`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of `rep`, which is the number of iterations the loop executed.

Output: **rep (where rep is the number of iterations the loop executed)**
