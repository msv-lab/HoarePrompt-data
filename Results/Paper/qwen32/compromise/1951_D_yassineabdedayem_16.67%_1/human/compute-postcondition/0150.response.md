The loop iterates over the elements of the list `tab`, which contains two elements: '5' and '5'. The loop prints each element of `tab` followed by a space. Since `tab` has only two elements, the loop will execute exactly two times.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations (which are actually only two iterations since `tab` only has two elements), we can determine that the loop will complete after these two iterations.

Here's the breakdown:
- After the first iteration, `i` is '5', and it prints '5 '.
- After the second iteration, `i` is again '5', and it prints '5 '.

The loop does not modify any of the variables `k`, `t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, or `number`. The variable `i` is only used within the loop and does not persist after the loop completes.

Thus, the final output state of the loop after all iterations is:

Output State: **`k` is 0, `t` is 1, `n` is 0, `rep` is 2, `tab` is ['5', '5'], `number` is 5**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the values of `k`, `t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number` remain unchanged from their initial values. The variable `i` does not exist outside the loop, so it is not part of the final output state.
