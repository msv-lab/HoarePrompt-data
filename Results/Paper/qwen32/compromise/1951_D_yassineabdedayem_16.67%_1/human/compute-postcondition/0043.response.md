To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state. Here is the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is the number of iterations the loop executed (<= 60).
- `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of a number.

However, the variable `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since the variable `i` is not defined in the given information, we need to infer where it might come from. Typically, `i` is used as a loop variable in a `for` loop. Given that `rep` is mentioned as the number of iterations the loop executed, we can infer that `i` is likely the loop variable in a loop that runs `rep` times.

Assuming `i` is the loop variable, the value of `i` will depend on the current iteration of the loop. The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space, without moving to a new line.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided and can vary depending on the iteration, we can describe the output in terms of `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the current iteration value of the loop, ranging from 0 to rep-1)**
