The given initial state provides specific values for several variables. The variable `i` is explicitly set to the string `'6'`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`). Since `i` is `'6'`, the output will be the string `'6'` followed by a space.

Output: **6 **
