The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it determines whether it's possible to reduce `k` to 0 by repeatedly subtracting the minimum of `n // k` and `k` (or the maximum of `n // k` and `k` under certain conditions) from `k`, while also decrementing `n` accordingly. If `k` can be reduced to 0, it outputs "YES", followed by the number of operations performed and the sequence of numbers used in the operations. If `k` cannot be reduced to 0, it outputs "NO".
