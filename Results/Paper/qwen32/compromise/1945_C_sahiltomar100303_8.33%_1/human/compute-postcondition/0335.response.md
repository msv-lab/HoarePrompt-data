The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`left` is 1, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 10, `t` is `t - (2 - 1)`, `s` is a string, `tleftZero` is `count_zero`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is -2, `leftOne` is `count_one - 1`, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`**

In natural language: The value of `rightZero` has increased by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
