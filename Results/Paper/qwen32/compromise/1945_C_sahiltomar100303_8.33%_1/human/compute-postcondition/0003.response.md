The code snippet `s = input()` assigns the value of the user input to the variable `s`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is still an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is still an input integer, and `s` is the value provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value provided by the user input.**
