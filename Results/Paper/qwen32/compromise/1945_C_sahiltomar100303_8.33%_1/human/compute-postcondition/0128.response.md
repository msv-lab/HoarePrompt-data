Postcondition: **`tleftZero` is at least `(final_right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is at least `(n - final_right + 1) // 2`, `right` is `final_right`, `left` is not 0, `right` is not equal to `n`. If the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, then the condition in the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition in the else statement is satisfied, and `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left)` is greater than `abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
