Based on the provided initial state, let's analyze the value of the variable `right` that will be printed by the `print(right)` statement.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `tleftZero` is at least `(final_right + 1) // 2`
- `trightOne` is at least `(n - final_right + 1) // 2`
- `right` is `final_right`
- `left` is not 0
- `right` is not equal to `n`
- `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left)` is greater than `abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`

From the initial state, we know that `right` is explicitly defined as `final_right`. Therefore, the value that will be printed is `final_right`.

Since `final_right` is not explicitly given a numerical value, we can only describe the output in terms of `final_right`.

Output: **final_right (where final_right is the value of the variable right)**
