The value of `mid` is assigned the integer division of `n` by 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value provided by the user input; `mid` is `n // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value provided by the user input; `mid` is `n // 2`.**
