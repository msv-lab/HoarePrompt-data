The code snippet `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `trightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `trightOne` was 0, so after the increment, `trightOne` becomes 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 1, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is 1, `i` is `mid`, and `s[i]` is not '0'**.
