Postcondition: **`leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `mid` is less than `n`; `i` is `mid + 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is incremented by 1.**
