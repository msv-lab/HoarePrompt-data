Output State: **`leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` is less than `n`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1, `trightOne` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1', `i` is `mid + 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `rightZero` has been incremented by 1. The values of other variables (`leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `mid`, `trightOne`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
