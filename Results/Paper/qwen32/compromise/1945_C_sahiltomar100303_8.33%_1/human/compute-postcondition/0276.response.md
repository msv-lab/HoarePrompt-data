The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. The values of `mid`, `s[i]`, and `leftZero` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `mid` is at least 1, the current value of `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is incremented by 1, and `tleftZero` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`mid` is at least 1, the current value of `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is incremented by 1, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1.**
