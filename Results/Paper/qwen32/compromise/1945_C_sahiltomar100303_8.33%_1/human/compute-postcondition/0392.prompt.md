Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tleftZero` is at least `(final_right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is at least `(n - final_right + 1) // 2`, `right` is `final_right`, and other variables remain unchanged. If `left` is 0, the conditions specified in the if part hold, and if `right` is equal to `n`, `rightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is not 0, the conditions specified in the else part hold, and if `right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: left is 0, mid is 5, n is 10, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 5, rightOne is 1, and right is 10. If `left` is 0 and `right` is not equal to `n`, the condition holds without further changes to the variables. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 or less than (n + 1) // 2. If `left` is not 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to 6, otherwise `tleftZero` is less than (n + 1) // 2. If `left` is not 0 and `right` is not equal to `n`, then the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `right`, or the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `right`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `left` is 0 if the initial condition is met, otherwise `left` is not 0. `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 2, `t` is `t - 3`, `s` is a string, and `leftMove` is 0. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1 and `trightZero` is -1; otherwise, `tleftZero` is 0 and `trightOne` is 1. If `right` is equal to `n`, then in the if part, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than 1, and in the else part, `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the condition in the if part holds if the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2 - left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2 - right`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
