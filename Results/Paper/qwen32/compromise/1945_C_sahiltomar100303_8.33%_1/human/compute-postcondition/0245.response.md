Postcondition: **left is 0, mid is 5, n is 10, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 5, rightOne is 1, and right is 10. If right is not equal to n, the condition holds without further changes to the variables. If right is equal to n, then rightOne is either greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 or less than (n + 1) // 2.**
