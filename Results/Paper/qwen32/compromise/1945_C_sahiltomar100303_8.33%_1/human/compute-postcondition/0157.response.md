The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `mid` is `n // 2` and must be at least 1. Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `mid` must be greater than 1. The value of `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` will be 2.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are increased by 1.**
