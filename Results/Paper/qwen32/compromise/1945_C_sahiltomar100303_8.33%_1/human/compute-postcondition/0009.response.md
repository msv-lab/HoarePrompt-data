The code snippet provided initializes the variable `tleftZero` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value provided by the user input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 0.**
