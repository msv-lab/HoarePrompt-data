Output State: **`left` is 2, `mid` is 5, `n` is 10, `rightOne` is less than 4, `s[2]` is '0'. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` is updated to 2 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, changing it from 3 to 2. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
