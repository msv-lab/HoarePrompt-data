The code snippet provided initializes `leftZero` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will include the initial conditions for all variables except `leftZero`, which is now 0.

Output State: **`s` is an input string; `tleftZero` is at least `(final_right + 1) // 2`; `trightOne` is at least `(n - final_right + 1) // 2`; `right` is `final_right`; `n` is an input integer; if `left` is 0, the conditions specified in the if part hold, and if `right` is equal to `n`, `rightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`; if `left` is not 0, the conditions specified in the else part hold, and if `right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`; otherwise, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0.**
