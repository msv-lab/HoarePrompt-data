The code snippet provided initializes the variable `rightOne` to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `rightOne` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value provided by the user input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0.**
