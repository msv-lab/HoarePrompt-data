The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `mid`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `mid`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `mid`.

Given that `mid` is at least 1 and `i` is currently at a value that has just completed an iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration. Since `mid` is at least 1 and the loop is currently executing, `mid` should remain unchanged for the next iteration to potentially continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`mid` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.
State: **`mid` is at least 1, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize it as:
State: **`mid` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.
