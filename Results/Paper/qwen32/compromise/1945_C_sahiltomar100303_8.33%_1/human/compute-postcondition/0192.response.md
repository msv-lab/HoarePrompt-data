Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid` (which is 5). `leftZero` is 2. `rightOne` is 2. `n` is 10. The character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0'. `leftOne` is 4.**

In natural language, the output state is: `left` remains 5, `mid` remains 5, `leftZero` remains 2, `rightOne` remains 2, `n` remains 10, and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is still not '0'. The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1, so it is now 4.
