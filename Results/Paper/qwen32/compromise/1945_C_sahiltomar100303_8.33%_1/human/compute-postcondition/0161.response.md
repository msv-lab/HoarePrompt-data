Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `leftZero` is unchanged, `tleftZero` is unchanged, `leftOne` is increased by 1, `tleftOne` is increased by 2.**

In simpler terms, the value of `tleftOne` is now increased by 2, while all other variables retain their previous states or constraints.
