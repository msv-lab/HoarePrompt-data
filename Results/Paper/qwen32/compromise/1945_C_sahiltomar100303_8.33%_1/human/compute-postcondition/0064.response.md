Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is -1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` + 1, and `rightOne` is 0. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s`, and `rightOne` is 1. The counts `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged.**
