The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. 

Initial State: `rightZero` is 0. After the increment, `rightZero` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `leftZero` is `count_zero`, `rightZero` is 1, `leftOne` is `count_one`, `rightOne` is 0, `right` is 10, `t` is `t - 1`, `s` is `s`, the current character `s[i]` is '0', `tleftZero` is `count_zero + 1`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is `count_one`, `trightOne` is 0.**
