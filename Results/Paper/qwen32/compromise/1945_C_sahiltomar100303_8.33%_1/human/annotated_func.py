    #State: t is 0, left, right, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, rightOne, tleftZero, and trightOne are in a state that meets the conditions of the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a binary string `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the optimal split point in the string such that the number of '0's and '1's on each side of the split point meet specific balance conditions.
