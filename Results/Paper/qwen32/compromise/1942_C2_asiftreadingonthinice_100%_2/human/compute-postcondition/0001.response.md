The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, which is the loop variable for iterating over the range of `tt`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `tt` is at least 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to make the loop execute.

Given the constraints, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `tt` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The other variables should remain as they are described in the problem statement.

State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `ii` is 0**
