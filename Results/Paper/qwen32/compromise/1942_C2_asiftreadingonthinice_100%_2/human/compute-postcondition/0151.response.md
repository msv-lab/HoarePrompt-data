Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer minus (`i - 1`) if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is now `y - (i - 1)` and `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `i`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `ans` remains unchanged.**
