Output State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `tmp` and `i` remain unchanged. The code simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it is contained within.
