The code snippet appends the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given the initial state, `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing a single element based on the condition checked before the code snippet. After executing the code, `tmp` will definitely contain at least one element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.

Output State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`; `ii` is 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input and has at least 2 elements; `i` is 2; `ans` is `x + y - 1` if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2`; `tmp` is a list containing the element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`**.
