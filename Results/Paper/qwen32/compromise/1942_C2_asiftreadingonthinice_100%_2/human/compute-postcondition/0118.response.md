The code snippet appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given the initial state, `tmp` was an empty list. After the execution of the code, `tmp` will contain one element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.

Here are the conditions and values that remain unchanged:
- `ans` is `x + y - 2`
- `y` is an input integer
- `ii` is `ii + 1`
- `tt` remains unchanged
- `n` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements
- `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2
- `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even

The only change is that `tmp` now contains the new element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.

Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, `tmp` is a list containing the element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**
