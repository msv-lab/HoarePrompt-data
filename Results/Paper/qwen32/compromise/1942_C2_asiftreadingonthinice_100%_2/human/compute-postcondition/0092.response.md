The `break` statement will terminate the innermost loop it is in, but it does not affect the values of the variables `tmp`, `y`, or `i`. Therefore, the values of `tmp` and `y` remain unchanged, and the condition `y` is less than `i - 1` still holds true.

Output State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list, and `y` is less than `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
