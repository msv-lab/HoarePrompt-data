Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is the total number of vertices, `x` is the number of chosen vertices, and `y` is an additional parameter (its exact role is not specified in the provided output description). It also receives a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a value or performs an action based on these inputs for each test case.**
