Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `ans` is calculated based on the initial conditions, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer minus (`i - 1`) if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `ans` is calculated based on the initial conditions plus `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer minus (`i - 1`) if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is now `y - (i - 1)` and `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `i`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer minus (`i - 1`) if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`. If `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `i` and `y` is further decreased by `i - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
