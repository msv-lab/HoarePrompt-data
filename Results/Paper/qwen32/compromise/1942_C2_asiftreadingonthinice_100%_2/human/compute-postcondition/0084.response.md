Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times a difference of 2 was found between consecutive elements in `a`. `tmp` is a list of half the even differences (excluding 2) between consecutive elements in `a`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, then `tmp` includes `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2.**
