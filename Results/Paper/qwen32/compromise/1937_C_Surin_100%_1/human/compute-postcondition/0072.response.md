The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This line flushes the internal buffer for the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. However, it does not change the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, the values of `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `prev` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`.**
