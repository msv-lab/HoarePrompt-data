Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the new integer input by the user, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i
    elif r == '=':
        print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r2 = input('')
        if r2 == '<':
            prev = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `r` is the user input. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is `i`. Otherwise, `prev` is `i` if `r` was `'<'` and `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `r` is the value of `input()`. If `r` equals `>`, `prev` is equal to the incremented value of `i`. If `r` equals `=`, `r2` is the value of the new input, and if `r2` equals `<`, `prev` is set to the previous value of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is the value of user input. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is undefined. If `r` is `'='`, `r2` is the value of user input, and if `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is set to the value of `i` before the increment. Otherwise, `prev` remains undefined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
