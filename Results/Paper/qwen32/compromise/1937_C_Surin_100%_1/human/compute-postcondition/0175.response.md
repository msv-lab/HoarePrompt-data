Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `r` is the user input.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains greater than 1. The value of `g` remains 0. The value of `v1` remains the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received). The value of `v2` remains `n-1`. The value of `prev` remains 0. The value of `kp` is incremented by 1. The variable `r` is assigned the value of the user input.
