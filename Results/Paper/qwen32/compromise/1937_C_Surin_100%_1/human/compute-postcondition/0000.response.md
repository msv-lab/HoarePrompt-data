The provided code snippet is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split element to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers. This function does not modify any existing variables or affect the state of any other variables outside of what is provided as input. The initial state describes a context involving multiple test cases with permutations and queries, but the given code snippet does not interact with that context directly.

Output State: **The function `I` is defined to read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and return the list of integers. The initial state regarding test cases, permutations, and queries remains unchanged.**
