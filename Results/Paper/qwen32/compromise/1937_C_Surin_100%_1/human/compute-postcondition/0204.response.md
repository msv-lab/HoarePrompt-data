The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `n` and `r` remain unchanged. The output state is: `n` is greater than `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is the value of user input, and `prev` is equal to the value of `i` before the increment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is the value of user input, `prev` is the value of `i` before the increment.**
