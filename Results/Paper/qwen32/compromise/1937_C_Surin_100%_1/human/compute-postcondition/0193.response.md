To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`n`**: It is mentioned that `n` must be greater than 1. However, `n` is not directly used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output of this specific statement.
2. **`i`**: It is stated that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. This means that `i` has some value before the increment, and after the increment, it will have a new value. Let's denote the value of `i` after the increment as `i_new`.
3. **`r`**: The value of `r` is set to the result of `input()`, which means `r` will hold whatever the user inputs. However, `r` is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.
4. **`prev`**: The variable `prev` is used in the print statement twice. The exact value of `prev` is not provided in the initial state, so we can only refer to it as `prev`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```
This statement prints a formatted string where:
- The first placeholder `{i}` is replaced by the value of `i` after it has been incremented.
- The second placeholder `{i}` is also replaced by the same value of `i` after the increment.
- The third and fourth placeholders `{prev}` are both replaced by the value of `prev`.

### Output:
Based on the analysis, the output will be a string starting with `?` followed by the value of `i` (after increment) repeated twice, and then the value of `prev` repeated twice.

Output: **? [i_new] [i_new] [prev] [prev] (where [i_new] is the value of i after it has been incremented and [prev] is the value of prev)**
