The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, or `v2`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 1
- `v2` is equal to `i`

Since `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables, the values of `n`, `i`, and `v2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 1, `v2` is equal to `i`.**
