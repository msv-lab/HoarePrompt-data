To determine what will be printed by the given print statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 1.
- `v2` is equal to `i`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is a formatted string that includes the values of `v1` and `v2`.
- `v2` is explicitly stated to be equal to `i`.
- However, `v1` is not mentioned in the initial state, which means we do not have an explicit value for `v1` from the given information.

### Conclusion:
Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `v1` and `v2`.

Given that `v2` is equal to `i`, the output will be a formatted string where the first and second placeholders are `v1`, and the third and fourth placeholders are `v2` (which is `i`).

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [i] [i] (where v1 is an undefined variable and i is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 1)**
