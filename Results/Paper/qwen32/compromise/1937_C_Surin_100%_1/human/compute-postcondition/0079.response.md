Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is at least 2.
2. `g` is initialized to 0.
3. `v1` is initialized to 0.
4. `prev` is defined as the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`.
5. `v2` is defined as the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`.

### Key Observations:
- Both `v1` and `v2` are defined in the same way, as the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`.
- Since `v1` and `v2` are defined identically, their values will be the same.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement formats a string that includes the values of `v1` and `v2` twice each.
- Since `v1` and `v2` are the same, the string will contain the same value repeated four times.

### Output:
- The output will be in the format `? [value] [value] [value] [value]`, where `[value]` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v1] [v1] (where [v1] is the largest integer i (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's response was '>' or '=' followed by '<')**
