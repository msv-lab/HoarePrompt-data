The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. Given that `i` is `v1 + 1`, the value of `prev` will be `v1 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `v1 + 1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `i` is `v1 + 1`, `r` is the user's input, `kp` is unchanged, `prev` is `v1 + 1`.**
