The code snippet initializes a variable `g` to 0. The initial state specifies that the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer and that `n` is a positive integer. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected by the code.

Output State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer; `n` is a positive integer; `g` is 0.**
