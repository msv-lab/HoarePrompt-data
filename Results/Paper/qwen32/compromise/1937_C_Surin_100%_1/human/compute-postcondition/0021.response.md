The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than `i`.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is equal to `i` if `r` is `<`, otherwise `v1` is equal to `i - 1`.
- `r` is the new user input string.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `v2` is equal to `i`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next value it should take at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 again to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Note: The values of `g`, `v1`, `r`, and `v2` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
