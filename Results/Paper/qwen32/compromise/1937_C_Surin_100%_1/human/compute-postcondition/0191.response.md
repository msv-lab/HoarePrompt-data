The code snippet assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `r`. The previous value of `r` is unknown, but now it holds the value provided by the user input. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `r` is the value of `input()`**.
