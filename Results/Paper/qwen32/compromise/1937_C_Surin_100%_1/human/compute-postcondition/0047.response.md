Let's break down the given initial state to understand the values of the variables and how they will be printed.

1. **n**: A positive integer greater than 1.
2. **g**: Initialized to 0.
3. **v1**: The largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`.
4. **r**: Remains unchanged (its value is not specified in the initial state, so we will not consider it further for this print statement).
5. **prev**: Determined based on the conditions given (its exact value is not specified, so we will keep it as `prev`).
6. **i**: Set to `v1 + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

To determine the output, we need to understand the values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev`.

- `v1` is the largest integer from 1 to `n-1` for which the user's response was `'<'`. This means `v1` is a specific integer value based on the user's responses.
- `i` is `v1 + 1`, so it will be the next integer after `v1`.
- `prev` is some value determined by the conditions, but its exact value is not specified, so we will represent it as `prev`.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
- The character `'?'`
- The value of `v1`
- The value of `i` which is `v1 + 1`
- The value of `v1` again
- The value of `prev`

Given the above, the output will be formatted as follows:
Output: **? [v1] [v1 + 1] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the largest integer from 1 to n-1 for which the user's response was '<', and prev is determined based on the conditions)**
