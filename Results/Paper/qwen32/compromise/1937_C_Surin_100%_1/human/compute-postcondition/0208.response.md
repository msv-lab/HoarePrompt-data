The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `prev`. No other variables are modified. The condition `n` is greater than `i+1` and the increment of `i` by 1 are part of the initial state and remain unchanged. The values of `r` and `r2`, which are the result of user input, are also not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is the value of user input, `r2` is the value of user input, `prev` is the value of `i` before the increment.**
