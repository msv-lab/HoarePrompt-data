The value of `v2` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `n` remains greater than 1 as per the precondition. The value of `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 2, and this value is now also assigned to `v2`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 2, `v2` is equal to `i`.**
