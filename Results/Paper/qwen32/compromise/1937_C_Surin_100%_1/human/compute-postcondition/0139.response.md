Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than `v1 + 2`, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `kp` is unchanged, `i` is `v1 + 2`, `r` is the user's new input. If `r` is `'='`, `prev` is set to `v1 + 2` if `r2` is `'<'`; otherwise, `prev` remains 0. If `r` is not `'='`, `prev` remains 0.**
