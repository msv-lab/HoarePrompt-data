Postcondition: **`n` is greater than `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is the value of user input. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is undefined. If `r` is `'='`, `r2` is the value of user input, and if `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is set to the value of `i` before the increment. Otherwise, `prev` remains undefined.**
