The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `v1 + 1` and `n` must be greater than `v1 + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `v1 + 2`. The condition `n` must be greater than `v1 + 1` still holds, but now it must also be greater than `v1 + 2` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than `v1 + 2`, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `kp` is unchanged, `i` is `v1 + 2`, `r` is the user's input. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `v1 + 2`. If `r` is `'='`, `r2` is the user's input, and if `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is set to `v1 + 2`. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**
