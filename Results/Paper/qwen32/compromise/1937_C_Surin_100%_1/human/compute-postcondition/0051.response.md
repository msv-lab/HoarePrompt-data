Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`.
- `r` is the user's input.
- `prev` is determined based on the conditions given (the exact value of `prev` is not explicitly stated, but it is some value determined by the program's logic).
- `i` is `v1 + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is defined as `v1 + 1`. Since `v1` is the largest integer from 1 to `n-1` for which the user's response was `'<'`, `i` will be one more than that value.
- `prev` is a value that is determined by the program's logic, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state. We will denote it as `prev`.

### Output:
The print statement will output a formatted string with `i`, `i`, `prev`, and `prev` in the specified order.

Given the information, the output can be described as:
Output: **? [i] [i] [prev] [prev] (where i is v1 + 1 and prev is the value determined by the program's logic)**

Since `i` is explicitly `v1 + 1` and `prev` is a value determined by the program, we can write the final output as:
Output: **? v1+1 v1+1 prev prev (where v1 is the largest integer from 1 to n-1 for which the user's response was '<' and prev is the value determined by the program's logic)**
