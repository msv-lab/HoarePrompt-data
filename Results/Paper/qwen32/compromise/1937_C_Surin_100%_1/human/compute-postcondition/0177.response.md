The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `r` is `'>'`, `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we can't determine the exact value of `prev` after the execution, but we know it will be the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `r` is `'>'`**
