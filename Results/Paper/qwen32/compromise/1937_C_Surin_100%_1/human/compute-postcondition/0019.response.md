The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given the initial state, `v1` was equal to `i - 1` and `v2` is equal to `i` (since `i` was incremented by 1 before this line). After the assignment, `v1` will now hold the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i`, `g` is 0, `v1` is equal to `i`, `r` is the new user input string, `i` is incremented by 1, `v2` is equal to `i`.**
