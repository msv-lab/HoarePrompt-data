Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 1, `v2` is equal to `i`, `v1` is equal to `v2`, `r` is the user's input.**

In simple terms, the value of `v1` has been updated to be equal to the value of `v2`, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
