The line `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program. It merely flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the console immediately. Therefore, none of the variables `n`, `i`, or `r` are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is the value of user input.**
