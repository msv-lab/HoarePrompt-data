Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `r` is the user input. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is `i`. Otherwise, `prev` is `i` if `r` was `'<'` and `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged.**
