Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, where `⊕` denotes the bitwise XOR operation. We can ask queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation `p`.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps for each test case:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `v1` to 0, which will be used to track a candidate index that could potentially lead to the maximum XOR value.
   - `g` is initialized to 0, but it is not used in the program.

2. **Finding a Candidate Index**:
   - The program iterates over all indices from 1 to `n-1` and asks queries of the form `? v1 v1 i i`.
   - The query compares `p[v1] | p[v1]` (which is `p[v1]`) with `p[i] | p[i]` (which is `p[i]`).
   - If the result is `<`, it means `p[v1] < p[i]`, so `v1` is updated to `i`.
   - After this loop, `v1` should be the index of the maximum element in the permutation `p`.

3. **Finding the Optimal Pair**:
   - The program initializes `prev` to 0, which will be used to track another candidate index.
   - The program iterates over all indices from 1 to `n-1` and asks queries of the form `? v1 i v1 prev`.
   - The query compares `p[v1] | p[i]` with `p[v1] | p[prev]`.
   - If the result is `>`, it means `p[v1] | p[i] > p[v1] | p[prev]`, so `prev` is updated to `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it means `p[v1] | p[i] = p[v1] | p[prev]`. To resolve this, another query is made to compare `p[i] | p[i]` with `p[prev] | p[prev]` (which is `p[i]` with `p[prev]`).
   - If the result of this second query is `<`, `prev` is updated to `i`.
   - After this loop, `prev` should be an index such that `p[v1] ⊕ p[prev]` is maximized.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints `! prev v1` to indicate the indices that yield the maximum XOR value.

### Correctness:
The program correctly identifies a pair of indices `(prev, v1)` such that `p[prev] ⊕ p[v1]` is maximized. The key steps are:
- Finding the maximum element in the permutation `p` using `v1`.
- Finding another element `prev` such that the XOR with `p[v1]` is maximized.

The reasoning and implementation are correct, and the program adheres to the constraints of using at most `3n` queries.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
