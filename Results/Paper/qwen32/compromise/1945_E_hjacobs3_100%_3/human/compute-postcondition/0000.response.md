The code snippet assigns the length of the `array` to the variable `n`. Since `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `n` will be equal to the number of elements in `array`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), and `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation; `n` is the length of `array`.**
