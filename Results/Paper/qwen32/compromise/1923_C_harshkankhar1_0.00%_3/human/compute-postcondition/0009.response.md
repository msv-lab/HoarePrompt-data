Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `c`, an integer `q` representing the number of queries, and a list `c` of `n` integers. For each query, which is defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i`, the function processes the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive). The function returns the result of each query, which is not specified in the given constraints and relationships. The function handles up to `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of all `q` values across test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
