The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. Given that the initial state only describes the input operation, let's determine the output state.

Since the code directly assigns the values from the input to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`, we do not have any prior values for these variables before the assignment. The output state will reflect the values that these variables hold after the assignment.

Output State: **`u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input.**
