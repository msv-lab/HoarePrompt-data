Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with `m` lines of edge data. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific value `s` based on the given parameters and edge values, ensuring the result is within a modulo `10^9 + 7`.**
