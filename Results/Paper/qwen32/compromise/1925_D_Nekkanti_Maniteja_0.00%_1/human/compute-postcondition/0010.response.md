The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are overwritten by the new values read from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `f`, `i` is 1, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers as read from the input.**
