The code snippet reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input and assigns them to the respective variables. This overwrites the previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` with the new values read from the input. The values of `t`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `s_0 + c * a * k + c^2 * m * (k * (k - 1)) // 2`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop, `i` is incremented by 1**.
