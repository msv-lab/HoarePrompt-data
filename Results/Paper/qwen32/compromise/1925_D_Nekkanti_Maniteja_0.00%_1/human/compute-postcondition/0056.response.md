The value of `a` is incremented by the value of `f`. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is an integer read from the input, `v` is an integer read from the input, `f` is an integer read from the input, `a` is increased by `f`.

Output State: **`u` is an integer read from the input, `v` is an integer read from the input, `f` is an integer read from the input, `a` is increased by `f`.**
