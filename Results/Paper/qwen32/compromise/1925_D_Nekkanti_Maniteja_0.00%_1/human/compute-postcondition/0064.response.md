To ensure that the for loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `k`. 

The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0, because `range(k)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `k-1`. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute because `range(k)` will be empty.

The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in each iteration of the loop.

So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure that it is greater than 0.

State: **`i` is uninitialized (or 0, but it will be set by the loop), `k` must be greater than 0**
