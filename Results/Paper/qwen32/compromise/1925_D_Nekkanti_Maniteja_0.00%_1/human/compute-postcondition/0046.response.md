To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop updates the variables. The loop iterates `k` times, and in each iteration, it updates the variable `s` based on the formula provided.

Let's break down the loop:

```python
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
```

Here, `s` is updated in each iteration. The initial value of `s` is 0, and `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`.

The update formula for `s` in each iteration can be written as:
\[ s = s + c^2 \cdot i \cdot m + c \cdot a \]

Summing this over all iterations, we get:
\[ s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (c^2 \cdot i \cdot m + c \cdot a) \]
\[ s = c^2 \cdot m \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i + c \cdot a \cdot k \]

The sum of the first `k-1` integers is given by:
\[ \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i = \frac{(k-1) \cdot k}{2} \]

Thus, the formula for `s` becomes:
\[ s = c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{(k-1) \cdot k}{2} + c \cdot a \cdot k \]

After all iterations, the value of `i` will be `m + k - 1` because `i` starts at `m` and increments by 1 in each iteration.

The final output state is:
\[ s = c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{(k-1) \cdot k}{2} + c \cdot a \cdot k \]
\[ i = m + k - 1 \]

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c^2 * m * (k-1) * k / 2 + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input, `i` is `m + k - 1`.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, the variable `s` is updated using the derived formula, and `i` is incremented by `k-1` from its initial value `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
