The code snippet `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. This means the initial values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are overwritten with the new values from the input. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u` is a new integer read from the input, `v` is a new integer read from the input, `f` is a new integer read from the input, `a` is increased by `f`, `i` is `i + 1`, `m` is the same**.
