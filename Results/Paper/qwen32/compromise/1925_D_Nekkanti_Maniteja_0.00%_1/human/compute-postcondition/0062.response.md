The value of `a` is incremented by the value of `f`. The values of `i`, `m`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`, `m` is the same, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the three integers read from the input, and `a` is `a + f`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `m` is the same, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the three integers read from the input, `a` is `a + f`.**
