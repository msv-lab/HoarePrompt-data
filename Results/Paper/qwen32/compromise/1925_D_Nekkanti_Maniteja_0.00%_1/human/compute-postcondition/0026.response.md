Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `s_0 + c * a * k + c^2 * m * (k * (k - 1)) // 2`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop, `i` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The value of `M` is updated to be \(10^9 + 7\). All other variables retain their previous values and states as described in the initial state.
