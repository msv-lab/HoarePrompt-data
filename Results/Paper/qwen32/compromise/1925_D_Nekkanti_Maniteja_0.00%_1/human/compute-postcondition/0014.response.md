The code snippet `a += f` modifies the value of `a` by adding `f` to it. Given the initial state where `a` is defined as `2 * f`, after the operation, `a` will be `2 * f + f`, which simplifies to `3 * f`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `i`, `u`, `v`, and `f`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `3 * f`, `i` is 2, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers read from the input.**
