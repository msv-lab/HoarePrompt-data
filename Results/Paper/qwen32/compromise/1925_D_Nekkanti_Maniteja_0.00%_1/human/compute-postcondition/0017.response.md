The given code snippet modifies the variable `s` by adding to it the result of the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a`. Since `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, and `M` is a constant, the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` can be simplified to `c * c * i * m + c * a`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `t` are not modified by the code snippet and remain as they were in the initial state. The variable `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop and is also not modified by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * c * i * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop, `k` must be greater than 0**.
