Reasoning:

The given program attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions, but there are several issues in the logic and implementation that make it incorrect.

1. **Combinatorial Calculation Error**: The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of `n*(n-1)//2`, which is the number of possible pairs of children. However, the way `s` is calculated does not correctly reflect the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The formula used in the loop `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not match the problem's requirements.

2. **Incremental Friendship Value Calculation**: The problem requires that for each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent excursions. The program does not correctly simulate this process. It should consider the probability of choosing each pair of friends and the incremental increase in their friendship values over `k` excursions.

3. **Summation of Expected Values**: The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends and then summing these values over all excursions. The program does not do this correctly.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**: While the program uses modular arithmetic, it does not correctly apply it to the expected value calculation. The final result should be the expected sum of friendship values modulo `10^9 + 7`, but the program's logic does not ensure this.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
