### Reasoning:

Let's evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the annotated code, and the original assessment.

**Problem Overview:**
- We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen.
- The final expected value should be expressed as a fraction and then converted to a modular inverse modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of pairs and their initial friendship values.

2. **Calculation of `c`:**
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, `n * (n - 1) // 2`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is correct for the probability of selecting any particular pair.

3. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program sums up all initial friendship values in `a`.
   - This is correct.

4. **Updating `s` in the Loop:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` incorrectly updates `s` with `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly reflect the expected sum of friendship values.
   - The expected sum should account for the probability of selecting each pair and the incremental increase in friendship values.

5. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program uses modular arithmetic correctly for the inverse, but the overall sum `s` should be calculated correctly first before taking the modulo.

**Original Assessment:**
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the sum `s` is not calculated correctly.
- It suggests a corrected version of the program that properly calculates the expected sum of friendship values by considering the initial sum and the expected increase over `k` excursions.

**Corrected Program:**
- The corrected program calculates the expected sum of friendship values correctly by considering the initial sum of friendship values and the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.
- It correctly handles the probability of selecting each pair and the incremental increase in friendship values.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The corrected version provided in the original assessment addresses these issues.

**Final: False**
