Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the provided function summary.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) in a permutation \(p\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. The program can ask queries of the form `? a b c d` to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.

### Code Analysis

Here is the provided code again for reference:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        maxi = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        arr = [0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        mini = arr[0]
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code

1. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The code initializes `maxi` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the array from index 1 to \(n-1\).
   - For each index `i`, it queries `? maxi maxi i i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `maxi` to `i`.
   - This step correctly identifies the index of the maximum element in the permutation.

2. **Finding Candidates for Minimum Element**:
   - The code initializes `arr` with the index 0.
   - It then iterates through the array from index 1 to \(n-1\).
   - For each index `i`, it queries `? maxi arr[0] maxi i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it sets `arr` to `[i]`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `arr`.
   - This step aims to find indices that, when ORed with `maxi`, yield the same result as `maxi OR maxi`.

3. **Choosing the Minimum Element**:
   - The code initializes `mini` to the first element of `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining elements of `arr`.
   - For each element `item`, it queries `? mini mini item item`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mini` to `item`.
   - This step aims to find the smallest element among the candidates.

### Evaluation and Reasoning

The code's logic is flawed in several ways:

1. **Finding Candidates for Minimum Element**:
   - The condition `? maxi arr[0] maxi i` checks if `maxi OR arr[0]` is less than `maxi OR i`. However, this does not necessarily identify indices that will maximize the XOR with `maxi`.
   - The correct approach should involve more sophisticated queries to identify the correct candidates for maximizing the XOR.

2. **Choosing the Minimum Element**:
   - The logic to find the minimum element among the candidates is incorrect for the same reason as above. It does not guarantee that the chosen element will maximize the XOR with `maxi`.

### Conclusion

The provided code does not guarantee to find the pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. The approach taken in the code is flawed and does not cover all possible cases.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
