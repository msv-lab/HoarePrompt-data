Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` includes the new element `i`. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged. `res` is the input string, `i` is `x + 1`.**
