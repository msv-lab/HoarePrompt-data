Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, and `res` is the input string. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is updated to `[0, i]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains `[0]`.**
