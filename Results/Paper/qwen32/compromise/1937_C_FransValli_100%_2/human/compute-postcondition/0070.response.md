The code snippet `res = input()` reads an input value from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. This input value can be any string, and it does not affect the values of the other variables directly. The variables `t`, `n`, `maxi`, and `arr` retain their initial values, while `mini` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be at least 2, `maxi` is 0, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, `res` is the input string.**
