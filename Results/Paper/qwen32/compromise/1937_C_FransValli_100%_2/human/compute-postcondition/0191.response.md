Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received, `mini` is `item`, `arr` contains at least two elements where the response was `'='`, `item` is `arr[3]`, `res` is the value of the user input.**

The value of `mini` has been updated to be equal to `item`. All other variables retain their initial values.
