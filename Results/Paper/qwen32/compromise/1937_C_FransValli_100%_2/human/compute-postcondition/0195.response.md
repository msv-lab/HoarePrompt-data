Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and for each test case, maxi is the index of the largest element in the permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}, mini is the index of the smallest element in the permutation, and the loop has finished processing all test cases.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains unchanged as the number of test cases, `n` is the size of the permutation for the current test case, `maxi` is the index of the largest element in the permutation, and `mini` is the index of the smallest element in the permutation. The loop has processed all the test cases as specified by `t`.
