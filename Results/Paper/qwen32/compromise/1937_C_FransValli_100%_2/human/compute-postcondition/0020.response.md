The given code snippet initializes a list `arr` with a single element `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `maxi` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `arr` is `[0]`.**
