The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is `i` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise `maxi` remains unchanged, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`, `res` is the new input value, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is `i` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise `maxi` remains unchanged, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`, `res` is the new input value, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**

To make it more explicit, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is `i` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise `maxi` remains unchanged, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`, `res` is the new input value, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the loop, we can state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is `i` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise `maxi` remains unchanged, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`, `res` is the new input value, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**

Since the only change is in `i`, we can write:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is `i` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise `maxi` remains unchanged, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`, `res` is the new input value, `i` is incremented by 1.**
