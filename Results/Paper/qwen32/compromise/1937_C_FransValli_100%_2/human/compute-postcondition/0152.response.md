Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). (This value is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.)
- `n` is at least 2. (This value is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.)
- `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or `0` if no such response was received. Since there is no information provided about any responses, we assume `maxi` is `0`.
- `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`. The value of `mini` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
- `arr` is `[0]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is assumed to be `0` based on the initial state.
- `arr[0]` is `0` since `arr` is `[0]`.
- `maxi` is again `0`.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, so it will raise a `NameError` if the code tries to execute as is. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume `i` is also `0` based on the pattern of `maxi`.

### Output:
Given the above assumptions:
- The print statement will output: `? 0 0 0 0`

Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
