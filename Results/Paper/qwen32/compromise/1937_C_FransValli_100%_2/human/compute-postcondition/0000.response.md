To ensure the for loop executes correctly, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which should be the number of iterations, `t` in this context.

Given the task, we need to ensure that `t` is correctly set to an integer such that the loop can execute the required number of times. The variable `_` is a conventional throwaway variable used in Python loops when the loop variable is not needed, so we don't need to adjust its state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the adjusted state:

1. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer provided by the input.
2. The value of `t` must be within the range 1 to 10^3 as specified.
3. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is not used within the loop body.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that the input value `t` is within the specified range and correctly represents the number of iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3**
