The code snippet `res = input()` takes an input string and assigns it to the variable `res`. This input string can be any string, but based on the initial state, we know that `res` is the new input string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains unchanged, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
