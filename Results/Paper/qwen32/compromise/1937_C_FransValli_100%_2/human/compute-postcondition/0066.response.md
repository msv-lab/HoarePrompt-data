The provided code snippet only includes `n = int(input())`, which means that `n` is being reassigned to the integer value of the user input. None of the other variables (`t`, `maxi`, `arr`, `mini`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `maxi`, `arr`, and `mini` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`**.
