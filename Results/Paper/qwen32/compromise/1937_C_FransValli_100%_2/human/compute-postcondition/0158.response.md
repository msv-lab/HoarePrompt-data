The code `arr.append(i)` modifies the list `arr` by adding the value of `i` to it. Given the initial state, `arr` is initially `[0]`. After the execution of the code, `arr` will be `[0, i]`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or `0` if no such response was received, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` is `[0, i]`, `res` is the input value, `res` is not `'<'`, and `res` is `'='`**.
