The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Therefore, `arr` will now contain `[0, i]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, `res`) remain unchanged. The output state should reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `arr` contains `[0, i]`, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, `res` is the input string, and `res` is `'='`**.
