To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. **`n`**: At least 2.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received.
4. **`mini`**: 
   - `arr[2]` if `res` is `'>'`.
   - Otherwise, `mini` remains `arr[0]`.
5. **`arr`**: Contains at least two elements where the response was `'='`.
6. **`item`**: `arr[3]`.

### Given Code:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- **`mini`**: This value depends on the condition involving `res`. If `res` was `'>'`, `mini` is set to `arr[2]`. Otherwise, `mini` is `arr[0]`.
- **`item`**: This is explicitly defined as `arr[3]`.

### Output Determination:
- The print statement will output a string that starts with `'?'` followed by four values: `mini`, `mini`, `item`, and `item`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Determine `mini`**:
   - If `res` was `'>'`, `mini` is `arr[2]`.
   - If `res` was not `'>'`, `mini` is `arr[0]`.
2. **Determine `item`**:
   - `item` is `arr[3]`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output `'?'`, followed by the value of `mini` twice, and the value of `item` twice.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is arr[2] if res was '>', otherwise arr[0], and [item] is arr[3])**
