Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `res` is the value of the latest user input. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is modified to include the current value of `i`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
