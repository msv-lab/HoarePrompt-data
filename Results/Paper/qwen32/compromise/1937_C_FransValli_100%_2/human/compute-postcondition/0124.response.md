To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`.
- `mini` is `item` if `res` equals `'>'`, otherwise `mini` remains `arr[0]`.
- `arr` must have at least two elements.
- `res` is the new user's input.
- `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]` after the current `item`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

### Determining the Values:
1. **`mini`**:
   - `mini` is set to `item` if `res` is `'>'`.
   - Otherwise, `mini` remains `arr[0]`.
   - Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we can't determine if `mini` is `arr[0]` or `item`. However, we know that `mini` will be either `arr[0]` or `item`.

2. **`item`**:
   - `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]` after the current `item`.
   - This means `item` is a specific element in the list `arr`, but without knowing the exact list or the current position of `item`, we can't determine its specific value.

### Output Description:
Given the above analysis, the output will consist of the following:
- `'?'` (a literal question mark).
- Two occurrences of `mini` (which could be either `arr[0]` or `item`).
- Two occurrences of `item` (which is a specific element in `arr`).

Since the exact values of `mini` and `item` are not explicitly provided, we describe them in terms of the conditions given.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is either arr[0] or item, and [item] is an element in arr[1:])**
