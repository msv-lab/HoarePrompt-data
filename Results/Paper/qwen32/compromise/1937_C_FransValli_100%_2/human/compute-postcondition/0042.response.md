The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, and `res` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but since the increment operation is not part of the provided code snippet, `i` retains its current value in the output state. Therefore, `arr` now includes the previous elements plus the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `res` is the value of the latest user input, `arr` is modified to include the current value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
