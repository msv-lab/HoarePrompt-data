Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `arr` is `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        arr = [i]
    elif res == '=':
        arr.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains `[0]`. `res` is either `'<'`, `'='`, or some other value not equal to `'<'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`. `res` is the value of the user input. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]` or `[i, i]` depending on previous appends, and `maxi` is updated to `i`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]` or `[0, i, i]` depending on previous appends. Otherwise, `arr` remains `[0]`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `res` is the value of the latest user input, `arr` is modified based on the value of `res`. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` contains only the value `i`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` includes the current value of `i`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
