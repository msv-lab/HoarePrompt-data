Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `res` is the value of the latest user input, `arr` is modified based on the value of `res`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated to the latest user input. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, `arr`, and `i` remain as per their previous states except for `res` and `i`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `res` now holds the new input value.
