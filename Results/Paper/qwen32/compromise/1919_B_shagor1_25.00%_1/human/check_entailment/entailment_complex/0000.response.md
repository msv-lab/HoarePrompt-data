Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task requires calculating the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array optimally, which involves considering the sum of subarrays and their lengths. The given program simply calculates `n - 2 * neg` or `n` based on the count of '-' characters, which does not account for the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- For the input `s = "--+++++++-"`, the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, resulting in penalties `0 + 4 = 4`.
- The provided program would calculate `n - 2 * neg = 10 - 2 * 3 = 4`, which happens to be correct for this specific case, but this is not a general solution. For other cases, the program does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

The program needs to implement a strategy to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty, which is not done by the current logic.

Correctness: **False**
