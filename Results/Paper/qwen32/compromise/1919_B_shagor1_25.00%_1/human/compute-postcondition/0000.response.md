The code snippet `n = int(input())` will update the value of `n` with the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'. The value of `t` (which is the number of test cases) remains unchanged.

After executing the code snippet, `n` will be assigned the integer value from the input, which could be any integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive. The string `s` and the integer `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'**.
