To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given print statement and the initial state provided.

The initial state gives us:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'.
- `neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```

Let's break down the print statement:
- The expression `n - 2 * neg` computes the difference between `n` and twice the count of '-' characters in the string `s`.
- The condition `if n != neg` checks if the total length of the string `s` is not equal to the count of '-' characters in `s`.
- If the condition `n != neg` is true, it prints `n - 2 * neg`.
- If the condition `n != neg` is false (i.e., `n` is equal to `neg`), it prints `n`.

Since `n` is the length of the string `s` and `neg` is the count of '-' characters, `n` will be equal to `neg` only if the string `s` consists entirely of '-' characters.

Therefore, the output can be described as:
- If the string `s` contains any '+' characters, it prints `n - 2 * neg`.
- If the string `s` consists entirely of '-' characters, it prints `n`.

Output: **n - 2 * neg if the string s contains any '+' characters, otherwise n (where n is the length of the string s and neg is the count of '-' characters in the string s)**
