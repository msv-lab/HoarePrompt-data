The variable `bc` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is the next character in the string `s`; `bc` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is the next character in the string `s`; `bc` is incremented by 1.**
