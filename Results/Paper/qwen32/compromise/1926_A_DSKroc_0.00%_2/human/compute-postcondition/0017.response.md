Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`. If `i` is 'A', `ac` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bc` is incremented by 1; `bc` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `bc` is increased by 1. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition regarding `ac` and `i` is still valid.
