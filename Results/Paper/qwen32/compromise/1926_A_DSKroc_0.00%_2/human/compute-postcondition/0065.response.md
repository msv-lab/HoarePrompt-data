Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a distinct string of length 5 containing only the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. After processing all test cases, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A's in the last string is greater than the count of 'B's; otherwise, it prints 'B'.**
