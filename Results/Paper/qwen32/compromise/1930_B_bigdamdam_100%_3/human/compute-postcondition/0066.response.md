The code snippet `ind = 1 + n % 2` changes the value of `ind`. The value of `ind` is now 1 if `n` is odd, and 2 if `n` is even. The values of `p`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is a list where elements at even indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2*((n-1)//2) are `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., `n-2*((n-1)//2)` respectively, and the rest are zeros; `ind` is 1 + n % 2; `i` is `2*((n-1)//2)`; `n` is the same as the input.**
