Output State: **`p` is a list where the first element is `n`, the second element is 0, the third element is `n - 2`, the fourth element is `n - 4`, and the rest are zeros; `ind` is `n - 4`; `i` is 4; `n` is greater than 4.**

Natural language explanation: The list `p` now has its fourth element (at index 4) set to the value of `ind`, which is `n - 4`. The other elements and variables remain unchanged.
