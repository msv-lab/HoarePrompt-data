To determine the necessary adjustments for the given loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variables `i` and `n`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The `range(1, n, 2)` function generates a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`, with a step of 2. This means the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1.

Let's analyze the provided state:
- `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n-2`, `p[4]` is `n-4`, ..., `p[floor(n/2) * 2]` is `n - 2 * floor(n/2)`.
- `ind` is `1 + n % 2`.

The state of `p` and `ind` does not affect the execution of the loop directly, as they are not part of the loop head. The only variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The initial value of `i` is not relevant before the loop starts, as `i` is initialized by the `range` function at the start of the first iteration.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n-2`, `p[4]` is `n-4`, ..., `p[floor(n/2) * 2]` is `n - 2 * floor(n/2)`, `ind` is `1 + n % 2`, `n` must be greater than 1**
