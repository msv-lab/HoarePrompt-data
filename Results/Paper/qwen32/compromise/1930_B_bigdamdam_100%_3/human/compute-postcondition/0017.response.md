Output State: **`p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n-2`, `p[4]` is `n-4`, ..., `p[floor(n/2) * 2]` is `n - 2 * floor(n/2)`, and `p[i]` is `1 + n % 2`; `ind` is `3 + n % 2`; `n` must be greater than 1**

In simple terms: The list `p` remains unchanged, and the variable `ind` is incremented by 2, making its new value `3 + n % 2`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 still holds.
