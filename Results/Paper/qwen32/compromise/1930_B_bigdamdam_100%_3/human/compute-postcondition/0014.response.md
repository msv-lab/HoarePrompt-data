The code snippet `ind = 1 + n % 2` updates the value of `ind`. The previous value of `ind` was `n - 2 * floor(n/2)`, but this value is overwritten by the new assignment.

- If `n` is even, `n % 2` is `0`, so `ind` becomes `1 + 0 = 1`.
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is `1`, so `ind` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.

The list `p` remains unchanged as the code snippet only modifies `ind`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n-2`, `p[4]` is `n-4`, ..., `p[floor(n/2) * 2]` is `n - 2 * floor(n/2)`, `ind` is `1 + n % 2`**.
