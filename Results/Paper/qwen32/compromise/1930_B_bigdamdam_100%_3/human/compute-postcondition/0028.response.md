The code snippet `p = [0] * n` replaces the existing list `p` with a new list containing `n` zeros. This means all the previous values in `p` are lost and replaced by zeros. The values of `n`, `ind`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is a list of `n` zeros; `ind` is `n + n % 2`; `i` is `2`; `n` is the first integer from the input.**
