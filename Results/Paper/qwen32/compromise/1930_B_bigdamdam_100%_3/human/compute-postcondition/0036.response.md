The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `2`, `n` is greater than `0`. The loop increments `i` by `2` in each iteration.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `4` to continue the loop. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `4` (since `i` is incremented by `2` and must be less than `n`).

State: **`p` is a list where the first element is `n`, the element at index `2` is `n - 2`, and the rest are zeros; `ind` is `n - 4`; `i` is `4`; `n` must be greater than `4`**
