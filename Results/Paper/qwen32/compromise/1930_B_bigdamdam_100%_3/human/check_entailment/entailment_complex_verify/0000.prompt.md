You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: For each test case, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the first `floor(n/2)` even indices are filled with values `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-1)` and the odd indices are filled with values `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., n-1 + n % 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each test case, it generates a list `p` of length `n` where the even indices are filled with descending even numbers starting from `n` and the odd indices are filled with ascending odd numbers starting from `1 + n % 2`. The function prints this list for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description:

The problem requires finding a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) where both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

The provided solution constructs the permutation by placing the largest numbers in the even indices and the smallest numbers in the odd indices. Let's verify if this construction satisfies the problem's conditions.

### Analysis:
1. **Even indices (0-based):** The largest numbers are placed here.
2. **Odd indices (0-based):** The smallest numbers are placed here.

### Verification:
- For any \( p_i \) at an even index \( i \), the next element \( p_{i+1} \) is at an odd index and is a smaller number. Therefore, \( p_i \) cannot divide \( p_{i+1} \) because \( p_i \) is larger than \( p_{i+1} \).
- For any \( p_j \) at an odd index \( j \), the next element \( p_{j+1} \) is at an even index and is a larger number. Therefore, \( p_j \) cannot divide \( p_{j+1} \) because \( p_j \) is smaller than \( p_{j+1} \).

### Edge Cases:
- **Small \( n \):** For \( n = 3 \), the output is \( [1, 2, 3] \). There are no pairs \( (i, j) \) that satisfy the condition.
- **Larger \( n \):** For \( n = 4 \), the output is \( [4, 1, 2, 3] \). There are no pairs \( (i, j) \) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution appears to correctly generate a permutation for all values of \( n \) within the constraints. It ensures that no two adjacent elements in the permutation can divide each other, satisfying the problem's conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program constructs the permutation by placing the largest numbers at even indices and the smallest numbers at odd indices, ensuring that no two adjacent elements in the permutation can divide each other, thus satisfying the problem's conditions for all valid inputs.
