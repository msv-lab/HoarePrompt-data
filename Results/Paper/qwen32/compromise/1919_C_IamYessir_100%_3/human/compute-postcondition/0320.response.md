The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Here's how it affects the variables:

- `a` was either an empty list or not an empty list. After appending `lit[i]`, `a` is no longer empty.
- `b` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged because the condition for changing `s` is based on elements in `b`, not `a`.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.
- `n` remains greater than `i`.
- `x` was `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty. After appending `lit[i]`, `x` is now the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`.
- `y` remains unchanged because it is based on the elements of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a list with `lit[i]` appended; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `x` is `lit[i]`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**
