Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element plus 1 if `b[i] > b[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. `i` is 2.**
