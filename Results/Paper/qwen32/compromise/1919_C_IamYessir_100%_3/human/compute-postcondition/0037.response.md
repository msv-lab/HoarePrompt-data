The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the current value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` will now include the element `lit[i]` as its last element. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `a` now contains an additional element, which is `lit[i]`. The conditions and constraints provided in the initial state remain valid, except that `a` is no longer empty (assuming it was empty before the operation, as `x` was `float('inf')`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is less than `y` and `x` is not equal to `y`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, and `a` now contains `lit[i]` as its last element. If `b` is an empty list, then `x` is `float('inf')` and `y` is `float('inf')`. If `b` is not an empty list, then `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` (before appending) is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a` (before appending), and `y` is the last element of `b`.**
