The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This affects the list `b` by adding a new element to it. Since the value of `i` is either 0 or `len(b)` based on the initial state, the new element is added at the end of `b`.

- If `a` was initially empty, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is `float('inf')`, and `y` is `float('inf')`. After appending `lit[i]` to `b`, `b` now contains one element, so `y` becomes `lit[0]`. The value of `s` remains 0 because no comparison has been made yet to determine if the new element is greater than the previous one (which doesn't exist). The value of `i` remains 0 as it is not modified by this code snippet. The value of `x` remains `float('inf')` as it is not affected by the code snippet.

- If `a` was not initially empty, `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `i` is `len(b)`, `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is the last element of `b`. After appending `lit[i]` to `b`, `b` now has an additional element, so `y` becomes `lit[i]`. The value of `s` remains unchanged unless the new element is compared with the previous one in subsequent code (which is not done in this snippet). The value of `i` remains `len(b)` as it is not modified by this code snippet. The value of `x` remains the last element of `a` as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list with `lit[i]` appended; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b)`; `n` is greater than `i`; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]`.**
