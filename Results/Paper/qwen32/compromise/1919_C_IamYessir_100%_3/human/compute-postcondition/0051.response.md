The given code snippet assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. `y` is positive infinity.**
