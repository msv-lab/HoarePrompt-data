Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` or `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > y` or if `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`. If `x >= lit[i]`, `a` is not an empty list and `lit[i]` has been appended to `a`. If `x < lit[i]`, `b` is updated to `b + [lit[i]]` if `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`.**
