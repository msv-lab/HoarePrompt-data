The code snippet provided is `cp = 0`, which sets the variable `cp` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, and `s`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is [], `b` is [], `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element.**
