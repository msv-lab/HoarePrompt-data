Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list that includes the element `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is a list (either empty or not empty), `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. Additionally, `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]`. Furthermore, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`. The current value of `lit[i]` satisfies `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` if the if condition is met, otherwise `a` remains the same.**
