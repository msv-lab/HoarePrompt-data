Output State: **`a` is a list that includes the element `lit[i]` at the end, `b` is a list (either empty or not), `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is `lit[i]` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, `y` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`.**

In simpler terms, the list `a` now includes the element `lit[i]` at the end. The other variables remain unchanged except for `x`, which now holds the value of `lit[i]` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise it holds the last element of `a`.
