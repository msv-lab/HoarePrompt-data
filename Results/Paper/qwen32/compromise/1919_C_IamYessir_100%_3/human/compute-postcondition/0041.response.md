Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, and `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`. If `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, then `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. The condition `x < y` remains true, and `x` is less than `lit[i]` which is less than or equal to `y`.**
