Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list named `lit`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `s`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged.
