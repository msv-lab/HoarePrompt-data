Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is `b + [lit[i]]` if `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged.**
