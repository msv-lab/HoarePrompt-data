In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `input()`. However, the context of the loop body suggests that for each iteration, `n` and `a` will be defined and used. Still, we can only adjust the state of objects in the loop head.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute based on the integer value obtained from `int(input())`. This value must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be initialized or adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
