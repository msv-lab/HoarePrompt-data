Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x` equals `y`, `a` includes `lit[i]`, and `x` and `y` are updated based on the last elements of `lit` and `b` respectively (or set to positive infinity if the respective lists are empty). If `x` does not equal `y`, the following applies: If `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, `a` contains `lit[i]`, `x` is set to the last element of `lit` (or positive infinity if `a` was empty), and `y` is set to the last element of `b` (or positive infinity if `b` is empty). If `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. If `x < y` and `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If none of these conditions are met, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. `x` is set to the last element of `lit` (or positive infinity if `a` is empty), and `y` is set to the last element of `b` (or positive infinity if `b` is empty).**
