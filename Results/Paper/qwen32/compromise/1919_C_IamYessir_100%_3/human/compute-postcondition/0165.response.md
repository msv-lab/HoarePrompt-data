Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `x > y`, then the following occurs: if `y >= lit[i]`, `b` includes `lit[i]`, `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i] > y`, and `y` is set to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]`, `s` is incremented by 1, and `y` is set to `lit[i]`. If `x >= lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is added to `a`, `b` remains unchanged, and `y` is set to `float('inf')` if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if not. If `x <= y`, then the following occurs: if `x == y`, `a` includes `lit[i]`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]`, and `y` remains the same. Otherwise, `a` includes `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i]` or `lit[i] > y`, `b` includes `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i] > x` and `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of the previous `b`, `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of the previous `b` and `y >= lit[i] > x`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `b` was empty or the last element of `b` after the append operation if `b` was not empty. In all cases, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, and `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.**
