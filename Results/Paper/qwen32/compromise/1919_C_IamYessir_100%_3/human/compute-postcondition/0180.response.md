The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` will now include one additional element, which is `lit[i]`. 

Since `a` has been modified by appending `lit[i]`, the value of `x` will change. Specifically, `x` will no longer be `float('inf')` (if it was previously) because `a` is no longer empty. Instead, `x` will be set to the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `s`, `i`, and `y`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list that includes the element `lit[i]`, `b` is a list that is modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer that is incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is `lit[i]`, `y` is updated to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty.**
