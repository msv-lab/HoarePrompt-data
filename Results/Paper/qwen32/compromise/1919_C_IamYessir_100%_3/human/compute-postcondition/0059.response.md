Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `y` ≥ `lit[i]`, `b` now contains the previous elements of `b` plus the element `lit[i]`. If `y` < `lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]` at the end, `x` is set to positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `lit`, and `y` is set to `lit[i]`. If `y` < `lit[i]` and `lit[i] ≤ x`, and `lit[i] > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` at the end, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` remains unchanged. If `y` < `lit[i]` and `lit[i] ≤ x` and `lit[i] ≤ y`, no changes are made to `a` or `x`, and `y` remains unchanged.**
