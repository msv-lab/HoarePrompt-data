To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `b` is a list of integers.
- `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element.
- `i` is `len(b) - 1`.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(s)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `s` is described as the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element in `b`. This implies that `s` is the result of iterating through the list `b` and comparing each element with its predecessor.
- The variable `i` is `len(b) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `b`. However, `i` is not used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.
- The `print(s)` statement will output the value of `s`.

### Determining the Value of `s`:
- To find the exact value of `s`, we would need the specific elements of list `b`. Since the elements of `b` are not provided, we can only describe `s` in terms of the list `b`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `s` is the number of times an element in list `b` is greater than the element immediately preceding it.

### Final Output:
Output: **s (where s is the count of times an element in list b is greater than the previous element)**
