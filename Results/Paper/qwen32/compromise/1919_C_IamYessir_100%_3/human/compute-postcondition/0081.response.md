Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `lit[i]` > `x`, then the list `b` includes the element `lit[i]`. Otherwise, if `x` was originally greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` was greater than `y`, then `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` remains as the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, or positive infinity if `b` is empty. Otherwise, `x` and `y` retain their original values.**
