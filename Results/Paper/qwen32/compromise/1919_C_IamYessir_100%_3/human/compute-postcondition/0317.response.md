Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; if `x` was initially `lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, then `x` is updated to `lit[i]`; otherwise, `x` remains unchanged; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**
