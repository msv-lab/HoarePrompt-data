Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0. If `b` is an empty list, then `x` is `float('inf')` and `y` is `float('inf')`. If `b` is not an empty list, then `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is greater than `y`. The current value of `i` is such that `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**
