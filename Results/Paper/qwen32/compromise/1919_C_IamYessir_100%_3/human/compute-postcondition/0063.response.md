The code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means the list `b` will now contain one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, so the element that gets appended is the one at the index that `i` was pointing to before the increment.

The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is an empty list or contains some integers, `x` is set to positive infinity if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `lit`, `b` is a list that now includes the element `lit[i]` from the previous value of `i`, `y` is set to positive infinity if `b` was empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` before the append operation.**
