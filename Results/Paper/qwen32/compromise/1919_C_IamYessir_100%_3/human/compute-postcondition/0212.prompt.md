Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is [], `b` is [], `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `x > y`, then the following occurs: if `y >= lit[i]`, `b` includes `lit[i]`, `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i] > y`, and `y` is set to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]`, `s` is incremented by 1, and `y` is set to `lit[i]`. If `x >= lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is added to `a`, `b` remains unchanged, and `y` is set to `float('inf')` if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if not. If `x <= y`, then the following occurs: if `x == y`, `a` includes `lit[i]`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]`, and `y` remains the same. Otherwise, `a` includes `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i]` or `lit[i] > y`, `b` includes `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i] > x` and `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of the previous `b`, `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of the previous `b` and `y >= lit[i] > x`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `b` was empty or the last element of `b` after the append operation if `b` was not empty. In all cases, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, and `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element if `x >= lit[i] > y`, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If `x > y` and `lit[i] <= y` or `lit[i] <= x`, no changes are made to `a`, `x`, or `y`. If `x <= y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element if `x < lit[i]`, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` remains unchanged if `x == y` or is updated to the last element of `b` if `x < y` and `lit[i] > y`. If `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= y`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is updated to the last element of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `x > y`, then if `y` ≥ `lit[i]`, `b` contains an additional element `lit[i]`. If `y` < `lit[i]`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element if `lit[i]` > `x`. If `x` ≥ `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` > `y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. The value of `y` remains the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If the condition `x ≥ lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y` is not met, `a` and `x` remain unchanged. If `x <= y`, then if `x == y`, `a` includes the new element `lit[i]` and `x` is the last element of the list `a`. If `x < y`, then if `x >= lit[i]`, `a` includes the new element `lit[i]` and `x` is the last element of the list `a`. Otherwise, if `lit[i] > y`, `a` includes the new element `lit[i]` and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `a` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of the list `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If `x >= y`, no changes are made to `a`, `x`, `y`, or `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
