Output State: **`a` is no longer an empty list, `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `a` now contains at least one element, which is `lit[i]`. The state of `b`, `s`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remains unchanged except for `a` and `x`. The variable `x` is now the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`.
