Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `lit[i] > x`, then `b` has the new element `lit[i]` appended, `s` is incremented by 1, and `y` is now equal to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `a` includes the element `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, `b` remains unchanged, and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. In both cases, `x` remains the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`. Additionally, `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]`.**
