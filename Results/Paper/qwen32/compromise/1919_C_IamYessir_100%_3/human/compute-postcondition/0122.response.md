The code snippet provided initializes two empty lists, `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `s`). Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a` and `b` are now empty lists, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is [], `b` is [], `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element.**
