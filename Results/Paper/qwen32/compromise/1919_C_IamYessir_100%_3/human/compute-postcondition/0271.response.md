The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This will change the value of `a` by adding a new element to it.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list
- `b` is a list (either empty or not)
- `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element
- `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `cp` is 0
- `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`
- `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`
- `x` is not equal to `y`
- `x` is less than `y`
- `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`

After executing `a.append(lit[i])`:
- `a` will no longer be empty (if it was initially empty) and will have `lit[i]` as its last element.
- `x` will be updated to `lit[i]` because `x` is the last element of `a` after the append operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is a list with `lit[i]` appended to it; `b` is a list (either empty or not); `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `x` is not equal to `y`; `x` is less than `y`; and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**
