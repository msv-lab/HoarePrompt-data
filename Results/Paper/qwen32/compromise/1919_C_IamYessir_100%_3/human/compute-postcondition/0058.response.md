Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]` at the end, `x` is set to positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `lit`, and `y` is set to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i] <= x`, and `lit[i] > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` at the end, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` remains unchanged. If `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[i] <= y`, no changes are made to `a` or `x`, and `y` remains unchanged. `x` is set to positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. `y` is set to positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**

This postcondition summarizes the changes made to the variables based on the conditions in the if-else block, ensuring that all cases are covered and the relationships between the variables are clearly described.
