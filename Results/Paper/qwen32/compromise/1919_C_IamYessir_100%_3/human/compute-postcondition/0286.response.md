Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b)`; `n` is greater than `i`; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty; `y` is updated based on the conditions described.**

In natural language: If `a` is not an empty list, `x` is now assigned the value of the last element of `a`. All other variables retain their initial values. If `a` is empty, the value of `x` remains unchanged, but since `x` is not defined in the initial state, it is now assigned the last element of an empty list, which would raise an error in practice, but for the sake of this exercise, we assume `x` is undefined or retains its previous value if it had one.
