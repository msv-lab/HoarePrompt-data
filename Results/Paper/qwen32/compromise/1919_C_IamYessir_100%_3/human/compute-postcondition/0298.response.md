The code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means that `a` will no longer be empty if it was initially empty, and it will have one more element if it was not empty.

- `a` will have `lit[i]` appended to it, so if `a` was initially empty, it will now contain one element `[lit[i]]`. If `a` was not empty, it will now contain all its previous elements plus `lit[i]` at the end.
- `b`, `s`, `i`, `n`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing all its previous elements plus `lit[i]` at the end; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b)`; `n` is greater than `i`; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**
