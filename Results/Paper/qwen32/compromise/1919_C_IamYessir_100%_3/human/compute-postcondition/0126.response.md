Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `x` is `float('inf')`.**

In this output state, the variable `x` has been assigned the value `float('inf')`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
