Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list (either empty or not); `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `x` was not equal to `y`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` was not initially empty, or `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty; `y` is `lit[i]` if `x` was not equal to `y` and `lit[i]` was appended to `b`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` was not empty, or `float('inf')` if `b` was empty; if `x` was equal to `y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a`; if `x` was not equal to `y` and `x < y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`, and `i` is decremented by 1; if `x` was not equal to `y` and `x >= y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`.**
