Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `p`, a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s`, a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) where 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n; and `k`, an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9. The function returns `mx`, which is the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered.**
