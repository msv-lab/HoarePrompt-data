The code snippet `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the value of `k` is now `k - 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s` is an index in `p` such that `vis[s]` is 1; `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\) and `k` is now `k - 1`; `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is `max(max(0, a[0] + k * a[0]), a[0] + k * a[s])`; `cur` is `a[0] + a[s]`; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1 and `vis[s]` set to 1.**
