The code snippet `cur += a[s]` increments the value of `cur` by the value of `a[s]`. Given the initial state, `s` is 0, so `cur` is incremented by `a[0]`. 

Therefore, the new value of `cur` is `a[0]`. The variable `mx` is initially set to `max(0, cur + k * a[0])`, but since `cur` has now changed, `mx` would need to be recalculated as `max(0, a[0] + k * a[0])`. However, the code snippet does not affect `mx`, `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `n`, or `vis`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, `n` is the length of the list `p`, `mx` is max(0, cur + k * a[0]), `cur` is `a[0]`, `vis` is a list of n zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1.**
