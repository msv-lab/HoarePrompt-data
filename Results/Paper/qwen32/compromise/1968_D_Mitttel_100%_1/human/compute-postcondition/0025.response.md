Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, a permutation list `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, an integer `s` (initial state), and an integer `k`. It returns the maximum value encountered for the expression `cur + k * a[s]` as it iterates through the list based on the permutation `p`, updating `cur` with the sum of visited `a[s]` values and decrementing `k` until `k` reaches zero or a cycle is detected.**
