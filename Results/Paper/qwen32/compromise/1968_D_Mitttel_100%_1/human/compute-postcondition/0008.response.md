Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9 - 1, `n` is the length of the list `p`, `mx` is max(0, cur + k * a[0]), `cur` is `a[0]`, `vis` is a list of n zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1.**

In natural language: The value of `k` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
