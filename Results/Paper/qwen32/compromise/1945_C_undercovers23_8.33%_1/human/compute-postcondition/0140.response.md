Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed by the `print(final[0])` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`final` List**: 
   - If `final` was initially empty, it will contain either `[0]` or `[n]` based on the value of `c1`.
   - If `final` was not initially empty, it contains elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`.

2. **`c1` Calculation**:
   - `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.
   - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` becomes `[0]`.
   - If `c1 < 50`, `final` becomes `[n]`.

3. **`pk` Calculation**:
   - `pk` is calculated as `n // 2`.

4. **`mini`**:
   - `mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`.

### Conditions and Outcomes:
- If `final` was initially empty:
  - Depending on `c1`, `final` will be either `[0]` or `[n]`.
  - Therefore, `final[0]` will be `0` if `c1 >= 50` or `n` if `c1 < 50`.

- If `final` was not initially empty:
  - `final` contains elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`.
  - `final[0]` will be the smallest element in this filtered list because `final` is sorted.

### Conclusion:
- If `final` was initially empty, `final[0]` will be either `0` or `n` based on the value of `c1`.
- If `final` was not initially empty, `final[0]` will be the smallest element in the filtered list.

Given the above conditions, we can summarize the output as follows:

Output: **final[0] (where final[0] is either 0 or n if final was initially empty based on the value of c1, or the smallest element in the filtered list if final was not initially empty)**
