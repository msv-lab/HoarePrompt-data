The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since the value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value being appended, but we know that `lst` will now contain one more element than it did before.

Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged except for `lst`, which now includes the new element `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string provided by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1`, `mini` is \(10^8\). The current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.**
