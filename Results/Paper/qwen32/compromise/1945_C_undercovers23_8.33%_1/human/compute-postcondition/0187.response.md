To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the given information about the initial and intermediate states.

Here's a summary of the loop and its effects:
- The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `lst`.
- For each iteration, it updates `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- `lst` must contain at least 3 elements since the loop executed 3 times.
- `mini` is updated based on the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in `lst`.

After all iterations (which is equal to the length of `lst`), `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`.

Let's denote the length of `lst` as `len(lst)`. After `len(lst)` iterations, the loop will have considered all elements in `lst`, and `mini` will be the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for any `ele` in `lst`.

Therefore, the final output state will be:
- `final` remains unchanged unless initially empty and `c1` met the condition.
- `t` is decremented by `n - 1`.
- `zero` and `one` reflect counts of '0's and '1's.
- `lst` contains indices where `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were both >= 50.
- `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.

Output State: **`final` remains unchanged unless initially empty and `c1` met the condition; `t` is decremented by `n - 1`; `zero` and `one` reflect counts of '0's and '1's; `lst` contains indices where `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were both >= 50; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `mini` will hold the smallest distance between `pk` and any index in `lst` where the percentage of '0's and '1's were both at least 50%. All other variables remain as described in the initial state with the exception of `mini`.
