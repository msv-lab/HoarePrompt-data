The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since the length of `final` was initially 0, after appending `n`, the length of `final` becomes 1 and contains the element `n`. The other variables (`mini`, `lst`, `c1`, `o`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. `final` is a sorted list containing the single element `n`. All elements of `lst` have been processed. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. `c1` is less than 50.**
