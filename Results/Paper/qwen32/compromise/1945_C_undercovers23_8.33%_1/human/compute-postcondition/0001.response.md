In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that doesn't affect the loop's execution directly; it just serves as a placeholder since the loop body is omitted.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t`, as it is the only one mentioned in the loop head. The variable `n` and `a` are mentioned in the context of what happens inside each test case, but they are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to control the loop's execution.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes, as it is already within the valid range.

Here is the state before the loop starts, adjusted if necessary:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\)**

Since `t` is guaranteed to be within the specified range, no further adjustments are required for the loop to execute.
