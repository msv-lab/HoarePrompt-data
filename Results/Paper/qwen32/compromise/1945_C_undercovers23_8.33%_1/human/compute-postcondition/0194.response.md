Output State: **`final` is a list containing `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, otherwise `final` contains `elem`; `t` has been decremented by `n - 1`; `zero` and `one` reflect counts of '0's and '1's; `lst` is a list containing at least one element; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `final` list now includes `elem` regardless of the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. All other variables retain their previous values.
