The code snippet provided is `s = input()`, which means the variable `s` is assigned the value of whatever is input by the user. This does not affect any of the previously mentioned variables (`mini`, `final`, `c1`, `lst`, `t`, `n`). 

Therefore, the only change in the state is the introduction of the new variable `s` which holds the user's input.

Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; if `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing the single element `0`, otherwise `final` is a sorted list containing the single element `n`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; all elements of `lst` have been processed; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the user's input.**
