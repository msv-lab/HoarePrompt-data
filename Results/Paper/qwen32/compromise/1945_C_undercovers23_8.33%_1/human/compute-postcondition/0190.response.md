Postcondition: **`final` is an empty list; `t` has been decremented by `n - 1`; `zero` and `one` reflect counts of '0's and '1's; `lst` is a list containing at least one element; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; the current value of `elem` satisfies `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
