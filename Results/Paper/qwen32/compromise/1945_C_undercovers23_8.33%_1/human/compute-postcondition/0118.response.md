To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it affects the variables involved. The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`, updating the variable `mini` based on the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the current element `ele`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mini` starts with a very large value (100000000).
   - `pk` is calculated as `n // 2`.
   - `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50%.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `ele` in `lst`, the loop updates `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After all iterations, `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`.
   - `pk` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `ele` will be the last element processed in `lst`.

Since the loop processes all elements in `lst`, the final value of `mini` will be the smallest absolute difference found during these iterations.

### Final Output State
- `mini` will be the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.
- `pk` remains `n // 2`.
- `ele` will be the last element in `lst` after the loop completes.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `pk` is `n // 2`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`.**

In simpler terms, `mini` will be the closest value to `pk` among all elements in `lst`, and `pk` will remain the same as initially calculated.
