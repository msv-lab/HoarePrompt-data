Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. All elements of `lst` have been processed. The length of `final` is 0. `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and its current value is greater than or equal to 50.**
