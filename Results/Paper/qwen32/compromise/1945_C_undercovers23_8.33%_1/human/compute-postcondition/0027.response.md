The code snippet provided increments the variable `zero` by 1. Since there is no initial value given for `zero` in the Initial State, we can only describe its new state relative to its previous state.

Given the Initial State, all other variables remain unchanged except for `zero`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string provided by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is 1, `zero` is incremented by 1.**
