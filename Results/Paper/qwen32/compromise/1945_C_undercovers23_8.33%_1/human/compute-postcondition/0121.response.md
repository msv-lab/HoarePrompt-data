Postcondition: **`lst` is a list with at least one element, `n` is the length of `lst`, `pk` is `n // 2`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `final` is an empty list. The current value of `elem` is such that `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
