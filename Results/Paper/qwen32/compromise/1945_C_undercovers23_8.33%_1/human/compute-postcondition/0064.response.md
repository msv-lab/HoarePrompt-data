The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `c1` using the expression `o * 100 // n`. This operation does not affect the variables `mini`, `final`, or `lst` as they are not referenced in the given code snippet. The variable `c1` is introduced and calculated based on the values of `o` and `n`.

Given that the initial state does not provide specific values for `o` and `n`, the value of `c1` will be `o * 100 // n`.

Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. All elements of `lst` have been processed. The length of `final` is 0. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**
