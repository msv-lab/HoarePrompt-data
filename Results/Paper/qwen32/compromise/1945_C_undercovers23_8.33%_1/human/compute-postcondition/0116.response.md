The only variable in the loop head is `ele`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `lst`. If there are more elements in `lst`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ele` was the current element being processed, and `mini` was updated to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ele` needs to be the next element in `lst`.

State: **`mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`, `pk` is unchanged, `ele` is the next element in `lst`**
