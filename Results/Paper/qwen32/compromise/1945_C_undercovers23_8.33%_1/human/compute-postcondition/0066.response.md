The code appends the value `0` to the list `final`. Since the length of `final` was initially `0`, after appending `0`, the length of `final` becomes `1`. The values of `mini`, `lst`, `pk`, `c1`, `o`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. `final` is a list containing the single element `0`. The length of `final` is 1. `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and its current value is greater than or equal to 50.**
