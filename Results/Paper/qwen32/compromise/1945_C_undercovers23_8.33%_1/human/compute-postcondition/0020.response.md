Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string provided by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is \(10^8\). If `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. Otherwise, `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1.**
