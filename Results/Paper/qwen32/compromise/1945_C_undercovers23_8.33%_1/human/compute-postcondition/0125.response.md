The code appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially empty (as per the condition that `final` is a list containing `elem` only if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`), after appending `elem`, `final` will contain one element, which is `elem`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`lst` is a list with at least one element, `n` is the length of `lst`, `pk` is `n // 2`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `final` is a list containing `elem`.**
