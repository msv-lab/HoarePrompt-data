Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the value of the integer input. The preconditions for `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are described for each test case that will follow.
