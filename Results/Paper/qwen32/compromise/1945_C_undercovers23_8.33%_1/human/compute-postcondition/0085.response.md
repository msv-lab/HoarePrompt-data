Postcondition: **`mini` is 100000000; `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing the single element `0`, otherwise `final` is a sorted list containing the single element `n`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; all elements of `lst` have been processed; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of `'1'` in `sl`; `z` is the count of `'0'` in `sl`; `zero` is `0`; `one` is `0`; `lst` is an empty list; `s[i]` is `'0'`.**
