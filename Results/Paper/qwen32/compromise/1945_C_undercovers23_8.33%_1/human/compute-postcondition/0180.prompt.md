Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `final` is a sorted list; if `final` was initially empty, it now contains either one element `[0]` if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or the single element `n` if `c1` is less than 50; otherwise, `final` remains unchanged as a sorted list containing elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and the element is equal to `mini`; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the user's input string; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list; `mini` is 100000000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `final` is a sorted list; if `final` was initially empty, it now contains either one element `[0]` if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or the single element `n` if `c1` is less than 50; otherwise, `final` remains unchanged as a sorted list containing elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and the element is equal to `mini`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains the single element `i + 1`. `t` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2. `s` is the user's input string. `pk` is `n // 2`. `sl` is a list of characters from `s`. `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`. `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`. If the current character `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. If the current character `s[i]` is not '0', `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1. `mini` is 100000000. `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `final` is a sorted list; `t` is decremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration; if `s[i]` was '0', `zero` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` includes `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `final` is a sorted list; `t` is decremented by 1; `i` is 4; if `s[i]` was '0', `zero` is incremented by either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false; `one` is incremented by 1 in the if part and by 2 in the else part; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))` in both parts. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` includes `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
