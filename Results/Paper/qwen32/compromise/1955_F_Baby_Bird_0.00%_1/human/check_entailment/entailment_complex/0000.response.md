### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

**Problem Understanding:**
- We have a sequence of numbers consisting of ones, twos, threes, and fours.
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
- Eve removes one number after each game, and our goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

**Key Observations:**
1. XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the count of each number contributing to a non-zero XOR bit is even.
2. Numbers 2 and 4 do not affect the XOR result because their binary representations are `10` and `100` respectively, and they do not affect the least significant bit (LSB) which is the only bit that can be affected by 1 and 3.
3. Therefore, the XOR of the sequence is determined by the counts of 1s and 3s.
4. If the counts of 1s and 3s are both even, the XOR is zero.
5. If the counts of 1s and 3s are both odd, the XOR is non-zero.
6. To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the counts of 1s and 3s even as many times as possible.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
- It then modifies the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s to be even by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2.
- It calculates the result as the sum of half the total count of these numbers (rounded down) plus 1 if all of the counts of 1s, 3s, and the modified counts of 2s are odd.
- The sum of half the total count of these numbers represents the number of games where Bob can win if Eve removes one number each time, potentially making the counts of 1s and 3s even.
- Adding 1 if all counts of 1s, 3s, and the modified counts of 2s are odd ensures that if initially all these counts are odd, Bob can win once at the beginning.

**Verification with Examples:**
- For the first example, `1 1 1 0`, the counts of 1s and 3s are odd, so Bob wins once at the beginning. The result is `1`.
- For the second example, `1 0 1 2`, the counts of 1s and 3s are odd, so Bob wins once at the beginning. The result is `1`.
- For the third example, `2 2 2 0`, the counts of 1s and 3s are even, so Bob wins in each game. The result is `3`.
- For the fourth example, `3 3 2 0`, the counts of 1s and 3s are odd, so Bob wins once at the beginning. Then, after removing one number, the counts can be made even, and Bob wins in the remaining games. The result is `3`.
- For the fifth example, `0 9 9 9`, the counts of 1s and 3s are odd, so Bob wins once at the beginning. Then, after removing one number, the counts can be made even, and Bob wins in the remaining games. The result is `12`.

The program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
