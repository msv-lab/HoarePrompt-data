You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers p1, p2, p3, and p4 (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: 3, 4, 5, 6
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value that is the sum of half the total count of these numbers (rounded down) plus 1 if all of the counts of ones, twos, and threes are odd.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem description carefully.

The problem description states that Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize the number of times Bob wins. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is 0. The program aims to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

Let's break down the program:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads four integers (the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s).
3. It modifies the counts by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2 (`p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`), effectively making all counts even.
4. It then checks if the sum of the first three counts modulo 2 is 3 (which is always false since the sum modulo 2 can only be 0, 1, or 2).
5. Finally, it prints the result of the above check plus half the sum of the modified counts.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Modification of Counts**: The program modifies the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s by making them even. This step is not explained in the problem description and seems arbitrary.
2. **Checking the Sum of First Three Counts**: The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the sum of the first three counts modulo 2 is 3, which is logically impossible. This part of the code does not make sense and seems to be incorrect.
3. **Calculating the Result**: The result is calculated as the sum of the above check (which is always 0) plus half the sum of the modified counts. This does not align with the problem's goal of determining the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Correctness Check

Let's consider a few test cases to see if the program works as expected:

1. **Test Case 1**: Input `1 1 1 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program's logic does not seem to handle this correctly.

2. **Test Case 2**: Input `1 0 1 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program's logic does not seem to handle this correctly.

3. **Test Case 3**: Input `2 2 2 0`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - The program's logic does not seem to handle this correctly.

4. **Test Case 4**: Input `3 3 2 0`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - The program's logic does not seem to handle this correctly.

5. **Test Case 5**: Input `0 9 9 9`
   - Expected Output: `12`
   - The program's logic does not seem to handle this correctly.

### Conclusion

The program does not follow the problem description and does not handle the test cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**.
