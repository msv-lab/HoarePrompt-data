To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to carefully analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements. Let's break down the problem and the solution approach.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the game continues until the sequence is empty.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

3. **Observations**:
   - XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.
   - Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in binary are:
     - 1: `001`
     - 2: `010`
     - 3: `011`
     - 4: `100`
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero as many times as possible by removing numbers optimally.

4. **Strategy**:
   - For each bit position (0, 1, 2), count how many numbers contribute a `1` to that bit.
   - If the count of `1`s for a bit position is odd, Eve can make it even by removing one number that contributes a `1` to that bit.
   - The maximum number of times Bob can win is determined by the number of bit positions that can be made even by removing numbers optimally.

### Program Analysis

The given program attempts to solve the problem using the following approach:

```python
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

Let's break down the program logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

2. **Calculation**:
   - For each count `x` of numbers (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s), it calculates `(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3))`.
   - This expression seems to be an attempt to count how many times Eve can make the XOR zero by removing numbers.
   - The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to get the final result.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the correctness of the program by comparing it with the problem requirements and the provided examples.

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `1 1 1 0`
  - XOR of `[1, 2, 3]` is `0`, so Bob wins once.
  - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `1 0 1 2`
  - XOR of `[1, 3, 4, 4]` is `2`, but by removing one `1` and one `3`, XOR becomes `0`, so Bob wins once.
  - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `2 2 2 0`
  - XOR of `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]` can be made zero three times by removing numbers optimally.
  - Program Output: `3` (Correct)

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `3 3 2 0`
  - XOR of `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]` can be made zero three times by removing numbers optimally.
  - Program Output: `3` (Correct)

- **Example 5**:
  - Input: `0 9 9 9`
  - XOR of `[2, 2, 2, ..., 3, 3, 3, ..., 4, 4, 4, ...]` can be made zero twelve times by removing numbers optimally.
  - Program Output: `12` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program seems to be correctly implementing the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
