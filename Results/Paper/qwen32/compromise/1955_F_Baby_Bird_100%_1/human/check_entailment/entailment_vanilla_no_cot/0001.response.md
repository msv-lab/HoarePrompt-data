To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the problem and the logic behind the solution.

### Problem Breakdown

The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve, the judge, removes one number at a time, and we need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Key Observations

1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is 0.
   - Alice wins otherwise.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**:
   - Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the remaining numbers' XOR is 0 as many times as possible.

4. **Counting Numbers**:
   - The sequence is defined by the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - The XOR of the sequence depends on the parity (odd or even) of the counts of 1, 3, and 4 (since 2 XOR 2 = 0, pairs of 2s do not affect the XOR result).

5. **Calculating Bob's Wins**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to create sequences with an even count of 1s, 3s, and 4s.
   - The number of times Bob can win is determined by how many times Eve can reduce the sequence to have an even count of 1s, 3s, and 4s.

### Program Analysis

The provided program uses the following logic:

```python
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

2. **Calculation**:
   - For each count `x` of numbers (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s), it calculates `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)`.
     - `x // 2` gives the number of pairs, and each pair can be removed to maintain even parity.
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder, and if the number is 1, 3, or 4 (i.e., `i < 3`), it adds 1 if there is an odd count.
   - The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to determine the number of times Bob can win.

### Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 0) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Result: `3 // 3 = 1`
   - Output: `1`

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 0) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 0) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 5`
   - Result: `5 // 3 = 1`
   - Output: `1`

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 0) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 0) = 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 9`
   - Result: `9 // 3 = 3`
   - Output: `3`

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 0) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 0) = 5 + 5 + 3 + 0 = 13`
   - Result: `13 // 3 = 4`
   - Output: `4` (Note: The expected output is `3`, not `4`. This indicates an error in the program logic.)

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * 0) + (3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * 1) = 0 + 13 + 14 + 14 = 41`
   - Result: `41 // 3 = 13`
   - Output: `13` (Note: The expected output is `12`, not `13`. This indicates an error in the program logic.)

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win. The logic for determining the number of times Bob can win is flawed, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

**Correctness: False**
