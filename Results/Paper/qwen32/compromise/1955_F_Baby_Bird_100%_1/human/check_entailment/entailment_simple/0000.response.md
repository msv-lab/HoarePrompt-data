To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic behind the code and compare it to the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, given that Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins when the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.

### Key Observations:
1. **Bitwise XOR Rules:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Numbers in the Sequence:**
   - Numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - The XOR of 1 and 3 is 2.
   - The XOR of 2 and 3 is 1.
   - The XOR of 1 and 2 is 3.
   - The XOR of 4 with any other number (1, 2, or 3) results in a non-zero value.
   
3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should aim to reduce the number of winning scenarios for Alice by making smart removals.
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should pair numbers that result in zero XOR when possible and remove them.

### Strategy to Solve:
- For numbers 1 and 3, they can be paired to result in a zero XOR (1 XOR 3 = 2, but we can consider pairs of 1s and 3s directly).
- For numbers 2 and 2, they can be paired to result in zero XOR (2 XOR 2 = 0).
- Number 4 cannot be paired to zero XOR with any other number in the set {1, 2, 3, 4}.
- The strategy is to maximize the number of such pairs and then consider the leftover numbers.

### Calculation:
- For each pair of 1s and 3s, Bob wins once.
- For each pair of 2s, Bob wins once.
- The leftover numbers (1s, 3s, and 4s) will result in Alice's win if they cannot be paired.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by summing up the pairs of 1s and 3s, pairs of 2s, and then dividing by 3 (which seems incorrect based on the problem description).

### Correct Calculation:
- Calculate the number of pairs of 1s and 3s: `min(p1, p3)`.
- Calculate the number of pairs of 2s: `p2 // 2`.
- The total number of Bob's wins is the sum of these pairs.

### Correct Code:
The correct approach should be:
```python
def func():
    results = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p1, p2, p3, p4 = map(int, input().split())
        bob_wins = min(p1, p3) + p2 // 2
        results.append(str(bob_wins))
    print('\n'.join(results))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
