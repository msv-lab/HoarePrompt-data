You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. The issue lies in the way the `char_map` is constructed. The program is replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric character from the string `r`, but the mapping is incorrect. Specifically, the program is mapping each character to the wrong symmetric character.

Let's break down the problem and the code:

1. **Constructing `r`:** `r` is the string of all distinct characters in `b` sorted alphabetically.
2. **Mapping Characters:** Each character in `b` should be replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. The symmetric character of the first character in `r` is the last character in `r`, the second character in `r` is replaced by the second last character in `r`, and so on.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
char_map = {}
for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
    char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
```
This code attempts to map each character `c` in `r` to a character starting from 'a' + (len(b) - i - 1). However, this is incorrect because it does not map to the symmetric character in `r` but rather to a character in the alphabet.

The correct way to construct `char_map` is to map each character `c` in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`:
```python
char_map = {}
r = sorted(set(b))
for i in range(len(r)):
    char_map[r[i]] = r[len(r) - i - 1]
```

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
Input:
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```
Expected Output:
```
codeforces
```
The string `r` would be `"cdefors"`. The correct mapping should be:
```
c -> s
d -> r
e -> o
f -> e
o -> f
r -> d
s -> c
```
However, the provided code incorrectly maps each character to a character in the alphabet starting from 'a', which results in an incorrect decoded string.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
