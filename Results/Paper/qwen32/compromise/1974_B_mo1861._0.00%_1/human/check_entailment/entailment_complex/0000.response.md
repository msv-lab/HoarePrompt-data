Reasoning:
The program provided is intended to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves creating an auxiliary string `r` which consists of all distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order. Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character from `r`. For decoding, the program needs to reverse this process.

The function `func_1` in the program attempts to do this by:
1. Creating a set of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorting them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
2. Mapping each character in `r` to its symmetric character in reverse order.
3. Using this mapping to construct the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value.

However, there is a critical flaw in the mapping process. The code currently maps each character in `r` to a character from 'a' to 'z' in reverse order, which is incorrect. Instead, it should map each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r` itself, not to characters from 'a' to 'z'.

Here's the correct mapping process:
- Create a set of unique characters from `b` and sort them to form `r`.
- Create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
- Use this mapping to reconstruct the original string `s`.

The current code incorrectly maps characters to 'a' to 'z', which leads to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
