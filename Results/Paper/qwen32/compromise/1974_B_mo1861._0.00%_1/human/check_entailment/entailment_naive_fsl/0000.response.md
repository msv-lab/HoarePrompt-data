Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. The issue lies in the way the `char_map` is constructed. The program is replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric character from the string `r`, but the mapping is incorrect. Specifically, the program is mapping each character to the wrong symmetric character.

Let's break down the problem and the code:

1. **Constructing `r`:** `r` is the string of all distinct characters in `b` sorted alphabetically.
2. **Mapping Characters:** Each character in `b` should be replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. The symmetric character of the first character in `r` is the last character in `r`, the second character in `r` is replaced by the second last character in `r`, and so on.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
char_map = {}
for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
    char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
```
This code attempts to map each character `c` in `r` to a character starting from 'a' + (len(b) - i - 1). However, this is incorrect because it does not map to the symmetric character in `r` but rather to a character in the alphabet.

The correct way to construct `char_map` is to map each character `c` in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`:
```python
char_map = {}
r = sorted(set(b))
for i in range(len(r)):
    char_map[r[i]] = r[len(r) - i - 1]
```

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
Input:
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```
Expected Output:
```
codeforces
```
The string `r` would be `"cdefors"`. The correct mapping should be:
```
c -> s
d -> r
e -> o
f -> e
o -> f
r -> d
s -> c
```
However, the provided code incorrectly maps each character to a character in the alphabet starting from 'a', which results in an incorrect decoded string.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
