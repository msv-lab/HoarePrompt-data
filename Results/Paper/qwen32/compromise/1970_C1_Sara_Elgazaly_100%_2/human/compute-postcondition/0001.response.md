The provided code snippet initializes a defaultdict with a list as the default factory. This will be used to store the adjacency list of the tree. However, the code does not modify the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `u_1`, `x`, or `y`. It only creates a new variable `lst`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node of the stone. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**
