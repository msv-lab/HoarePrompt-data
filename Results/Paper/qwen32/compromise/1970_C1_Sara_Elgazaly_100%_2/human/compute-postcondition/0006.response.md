Output State: **`lst` and `rev` are defaultdicts where `lst[a]` contains all `b` such that a pair (a, b) was read, and `rev[b]` contains all `a` such that a pair (a, b) was read. `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is assigned the value of `z`.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `lst` and `rev` remain unchanged as defaultdicts storing the relationships between pairs (a, b). The variable `z` retains its input value, and a new variable `tmp` is introduced with the same value as `z`.
