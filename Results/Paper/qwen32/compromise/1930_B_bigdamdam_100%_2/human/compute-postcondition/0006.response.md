The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Given that `ind` was initially equal to `n`, after the operation, `ind` becomes `n - 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 2, `p` is a list of `n` zeros with the `i`-th element set to `n`, `ind` is `n - 2`.**
