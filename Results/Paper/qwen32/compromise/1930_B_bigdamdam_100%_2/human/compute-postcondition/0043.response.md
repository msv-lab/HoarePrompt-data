Output State: **`p` has values `[ind, ind-2, ind-4, ..., ind-2*(floor(n/2)-1), 0, 0, ..., 0]` with the element at index `i` set to `ind`, `ind` is `3 + n % 2`, `n` must be greater than 1.**

In natural language: The list `p` remains structured as described, with the element at index `i` set to the new value of `ind`. The value of `ind` has been incremented by 2, making it `3 + n % 2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than 1.
