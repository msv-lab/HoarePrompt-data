The code snippet `ans += m - hmp[i]` increases the value of `ans` by the difference between `m` and the count of the current character `i` in the `hmp` Counter object. Since `hmp[i]` is less than `m` (as per the precondition), `m - hmp[i]` is a positive value, and `ans` will be incremented by this positive value.

Output State: **`s` is the new input string that must contain at least one character, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in `s` with at least one character having a count greater than zero. The current character `i` in `hmp` has a count less than `m`. `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.**
