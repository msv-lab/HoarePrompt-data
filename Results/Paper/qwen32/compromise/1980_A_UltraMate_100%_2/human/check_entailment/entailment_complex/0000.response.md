### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, and each round must have one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - Vlad already has `n` problems, each with a specific difficulty level.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create so that he can have at least `m` problems of each difficulty level.

2. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the given string `s`.
   - It iterates through each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - For each difficulty level:
     - If the difficulty level is not present in the `Counter` (i.e., `hmp`), it adds `m` to `ans` because Vlad needs `m` problems of that difficulty level.
     - If the difficulty level is present but the count is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans`.
   - The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

3. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where a difficulty level is completely missing by adding `m` to `ans`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where a difficulty level is present but not enough by adding the required difference.
   - The program processes multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case (`n=10`, `m=1`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`):
     - The difficulties 'A' and 'F' are missing, so `ans = 1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the second test case (`n=10`, `m=2`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`):
     - The difficulties 'A', 'F', and 'G' are missing or not enough, so `ans = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - For the third test case (`n=9`, `m=1`, `a='BBCDEFFGG'`):
     - The difficulty 'A' is missing, so `ans = 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
