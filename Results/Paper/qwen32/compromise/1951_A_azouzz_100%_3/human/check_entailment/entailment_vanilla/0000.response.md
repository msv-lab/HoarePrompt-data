Reasoning:  
The given problem description and the provided program do not match. The problem description describes a Python function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` which scans a directory for subfolders within a specified numerical range, checks for `.html` files in those subfolders, and then generates corresponding `-ac.py` and `-wa.py` files for each `.html` file found. 

However, the provided program defines a function `func_1` that reads input values, performs some checks on a string `s` to count occurrences of the character '1', and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. This program does not perform any file operations or directory scanning as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the provided program is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
