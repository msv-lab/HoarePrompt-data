Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `new_arr` as an empty list, while the values of `cur_arr` and `bit` remain unchanged from their initial states.
