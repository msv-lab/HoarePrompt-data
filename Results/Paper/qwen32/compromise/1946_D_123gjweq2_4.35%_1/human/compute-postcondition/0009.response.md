Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, new_arr is a list of xor values where the bit-th bit was 0, xor is the result of XORing elements that did not reset xor, and the bit-th bit of xor is 1, thing1 is -1.**

In the output state, `thing1` has been updated to -1. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
