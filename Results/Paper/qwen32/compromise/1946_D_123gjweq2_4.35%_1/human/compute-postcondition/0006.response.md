The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over `cur_arr`. For the loop to execute, `cur_arr` must have at least one element. The states of `bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`, and `thing1` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself, as they are not mentioned in the loop head.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `cur_arr` to have at least one element. The values of `i`, `bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`, and `thing1` can remain as they are since they do not affect the execution condition of the loop.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30 and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0**
