Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `slength` is an input integer, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `counter` is 3, `x` is `c[4]`, `no` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
