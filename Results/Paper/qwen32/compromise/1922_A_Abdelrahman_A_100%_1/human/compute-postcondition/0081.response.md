Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `tests` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- `a` is a new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `b` is a new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `c` is a non-empty string.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 1.
- `no` is False.
- `counter` is 0.
- `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

**Explanation:**
- The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `tests`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `slength`, `i`, `no`, `counter`, or `x`.
- It directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **YES**
