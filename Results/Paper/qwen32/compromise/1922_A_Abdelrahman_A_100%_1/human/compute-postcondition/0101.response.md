Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string, `slength` is an input integer, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 1. If `no` is `True`, it indicates that the loop did not break and `c` is neither equal to `a` nor `b`, and `counter` is the length of `c`. If `no` is `False`, it indicates that either the loop broke or `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, and `counter` is the position where the loop broke if it broke, otherwise the length of `c`.**
