Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s])`, `bm` is `max(a[b], max(0, bp))`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Since the condition `k == 0` is not met (as `k` is -2), no changes occur to the variables based on the if part.**
