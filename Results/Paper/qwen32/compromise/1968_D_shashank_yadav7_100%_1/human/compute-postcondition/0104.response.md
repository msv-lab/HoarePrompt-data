The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `min(n, k) - 1`, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is `min(n, k)`; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer minus `min(n, k)`; `b` is `p[p[p[...[b]...]] - 1]` (updated `min(n, k)` times); `s` is `p[p[p[...[s]...]] - 1]` (updated `min(n, k)` times); `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `a[s] * (min(n, k) + 1)`; `bp` is `a[b] * (min(n, k) + 1)`; `sm` is the maximum of all computed values of `a[s] * k + sp` across iterations; `bm` is the maximum of all computed values of `a[b] * k + bp` across iterations; `p` is a list of integers read from the input. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**
