Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each testcase, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` are integers such that 1 <= `P_B`, `P_S` <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^9. `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The sum of all `n` values across all testcases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is `n-1`; `n` is the number of iterations; `k` is 0; `b` is `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1` (nested `p` operations `n` times); `s` is `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1` (nested `p` operations `n` times); `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration; `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration; and `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is `min(n, k) - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer minus `min(n, k)`; `b` is `p[p[p[...[b]...]] - 1]` (updated `min(n, k)` times); `s` is `p[p[p[...[s]...]] - 1]` (updated `min(n, k)` times); `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `a[s] * (min(n, k) + 1)`; `bp` is `a[b] * (min(n, k) + 1)`; `sm` is the maximum of all computed values of `a[s] * k + sp` across iterations; `bm` is the maximum of all computed values of `a[b] * k + bp` across iterations; `p` is a list of integers read from the input. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, i is 0, n is unchanged, k is 0, b is p[b] - 1, s is p[s] - 1, a is unchanged, sp is 2 * a[s], bp is 2 * a[b], sm is a[s], bm is max(0, bp), and p is unchanged. If bm is greater than sm, then bm is greater than sm. Otherwise, bm is less than or equal to sm.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
