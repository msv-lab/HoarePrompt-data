Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `k` is an input integer minus 2; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`; `sm` is the maximum of `(a[s] - 1) * (k + 1)` and `a[s] * k + (a[s] - 1)`; `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k + 1), a[b] * k + bp - a[b])`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input. If `k` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

Given the code snippet:
```
b = p[b] - 1
```

The variable `b` is reassigned to the value of `p[b] - 1`. 

Since `b` was initially `p[b] - 1`, the new value of `b` will be `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `k` is an input integer minus 2; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`; `sm` is the maximum of `(a[s] - 1) * (k + 1)` and `a[s] * k + (a[s] - 1)`; `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k + 1), a[b] * k + bp - a[b])`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input. If `k` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
