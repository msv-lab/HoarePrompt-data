The given code snippet contains a print statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state provides various variable definitions and constraints, but none of these variables are used in the print statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'Draw'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged (its initial value is not specified).
   - `k` is initialized to 0.
   - `b` is set to `p[b] - 1`.
   - `s` is set to `p[s] - 1`.
   - `a` remains unchanged (its initial value is not specified).
   - `sp` is calculated as `2 * a[s]`.
   - `bp` is calculated as `2 * a[b]`.
   - `sm` is set to `a[s]`.
   - `bm` is initially set to `max(0, bp)`.
   - `p` remains unchanged (its initial value is not specified).
   - `bm` is then set to `sm`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('Draw')`.
   - This statement directly outputs the string `'Draw'` without using any of the variables defined in the initial state.

**Output**: **Draw**
