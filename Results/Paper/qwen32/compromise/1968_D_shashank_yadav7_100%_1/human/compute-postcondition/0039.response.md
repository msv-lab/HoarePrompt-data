The code snippet `sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` updates the value of `sm` by comparing its current value with `a[s] * k + sp` and assigning the larger of the two to `sm`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `sm` is the maximum value among `a[s] * k`, `a[s] * k + sp`, and `a[s] * k + sp` (which is redundant and can be simplified to `max(a[s] * k, a[s] * k + sp)`).
- `sp` is `2 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[s]`.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `s` is an index used to access elements in the list `a`.
- `k` is an integer that has been decremented by 3 from its initial value.

The expression `a[s] * k + sp` simplifies to `a[s] * k + 3 * a[s]`, which is `a[s] * (k + 3)`.

Thus, the new value of `sm` will be the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * (k + 3)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is an integer that has been decremented by 3 from its initial value; `b` is `p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `3 * a[s]`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `bm` is `max(max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * (k + 3))`.**
