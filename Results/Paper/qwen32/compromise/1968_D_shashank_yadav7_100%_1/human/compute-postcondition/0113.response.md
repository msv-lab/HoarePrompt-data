Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is `min(n, k)`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `b` is the third integer from the input minus 1; `s` is the fourth integer from the input minus 1; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `sm` is `a[s] * k`; `bm` is `a[b] * k`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**

Explanation: The value of `sm` has been updated to `a[s] * k`. All other variables retain their previous values.
