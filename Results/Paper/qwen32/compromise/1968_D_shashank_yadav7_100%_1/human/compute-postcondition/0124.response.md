The code snippet `bp += a[b]` updates the value of `bp` by adding `a[b]` to it. Given the initial state, `bp` is initially `a[b]`. After the operation, `bp` becomes `a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[b]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s]`, `bm` is `max(0, bp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
