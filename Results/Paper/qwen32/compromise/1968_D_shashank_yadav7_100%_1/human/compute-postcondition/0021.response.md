The code provided increments the value of `bp` by `a[b]`. Therefore, the value of `bp` will be updated to `bp + a[b]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an integer that has been decremented by 1 from its initial value; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]` (or `2 * a[b]`); `bm` is `max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `max(a[s] * k, a[s] * k + sp)`; If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
