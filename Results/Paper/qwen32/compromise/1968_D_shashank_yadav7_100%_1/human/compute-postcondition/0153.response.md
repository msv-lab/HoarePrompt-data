Given the initial state provided, we need to analyze the variables and their relationships to determine what will be printed by the `print('Draw')` statement.

Let's break down the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is unchanged (but its value is not provided).
- `k` is 0.
- `b` is defined as `p[b] - 1` (where `p` is a list, and `b` is an index into this list).
- `s` is defined as `p[s] - 1` (where `p` is a list, and `s` is an index into this list).
- `a` is unchanged (but its value is not provided).
- `sp` is defined as `2 * a[s]` (where `a` is a list, and `s` is an index into this list).
- `bp` is defined as `2 * a[b]` (where `a` is a list, and `b` is an index into this list).
- `sm` is defined as `a[s]` (where `a` is a list, and `s` is an index into this list).
- `bm` is defined as `max(0, bp)` (where `bp` is calculated as `2 * a[b]`).
- `p` is unchanged (but its value is not provided).
- `bm` is explicitly stated to be equal to `sm`.

The `print('Draw')` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `sm`, or `bm` directly. It simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print('Draw')` statement is:

Output: **Draw**
