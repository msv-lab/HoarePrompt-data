The code snippet `bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` updates the value of `bm` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is an integer that has been decremented by 1 from its initial value.
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`.
- `p` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `sp` is `a[s]`.
- `bp` is `a[b]`.
- `bm` is `a[b] * k`.
- `sm` is `a[s] * k`.
- If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The value of `bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value (`a[b] * k`) and the new value (`a[b] * k + bp`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an integer that has been decremented by 1 from its initial value; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `a[s] * k`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
