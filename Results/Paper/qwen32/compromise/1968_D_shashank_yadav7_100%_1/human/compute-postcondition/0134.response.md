The code snippet provided increments the variable `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. 

Given the initial state, `bp` is initially `2 * a[b]`. After the code snippet is executed, `bp` becomes `2 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[b]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s])`, `bm` is `max(a[b], max(0, bp))`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
