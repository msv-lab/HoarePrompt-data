Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n, k)`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `b` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer from the input minus 1, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `k` has been decreased by 1. All other variables retain their original values.
