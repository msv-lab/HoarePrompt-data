The value of `b` is decremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers read from the input with `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
