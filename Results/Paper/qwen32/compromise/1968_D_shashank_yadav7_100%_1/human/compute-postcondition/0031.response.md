The code snippet provided modifies the value of `bp` by adding `a[b]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, the value of `bp` is `2 * a[b]`. After the operation `bp += a[b]`, the new value of `bp` becomes `2 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[b]`.

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is an integer that has been decremented by 2 from its initial value; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s] + a[s]`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `bm` is `max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `max(max(a[s] * k, a[s] * k + sp), a[s] * k + sp)`; If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
