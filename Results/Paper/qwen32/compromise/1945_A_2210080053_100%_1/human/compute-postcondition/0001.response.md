To understand the output state, let's analyze the provided loop code and the transformations it applies to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The loop processes each line of input (except the first line, which presumably contains the number of test cases `t`). For each line, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then updates `b` by adding `c` to it (`b += c`). The core of the loop is the print statement, which outputs a value based on the condition `c < b % 3`.

- If `c < b % 3` is `True`, it prints `-1`.
- Otherwise, it prints `(a - -b // 3)`, which simplifies to `(a + b // 3)`.

Since the loop does not modify `t` or any other variables outside of the loop, the only changes occur to `a`, `b`, and `c` within each iteration. After the loop completes, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the last iteration will be the final values of these variables, but they do not affect the output state as described because the loop prints the result for each test case immediately.

Given this, the output state is simply a series of printed values for each test case, which are not stored back into variables but are part of the program's output.

However, if we need to describe the final state of `a`, `b`, and `c` after the loop, it will be the values from the last test case processed.

Output State: **the values of a, b, and c from the last test case will be the final values, but the primary output is a series of printed values for each test case.**
