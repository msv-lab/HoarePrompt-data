The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Given that `i` is 0 initially, `i % 2` is 0, so 'A' will be appended to `pattern`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` remains 0 as it is not modified in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `pattern` is ['A']**.
