The code appends a character to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2 ^ 1`. Given that `i` is 0, we can calculate `i % 2` which is 0. Then, `0 ^ 1` results in 1. Therefore, `'AB'[1]` is `'B'`. So, 'B' is appended to the `pattern` list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `pattern` is ['A', 'B']**.
