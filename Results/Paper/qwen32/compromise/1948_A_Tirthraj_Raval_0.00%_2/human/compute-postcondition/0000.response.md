Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned to the value of an integer input, but the constraints on `t` (1 <= t <= 50) remain valid. The variable `n` and its constraints (1 <= n <= 50) are still valid as they are not affected by this code snippet.
