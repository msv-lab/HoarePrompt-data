The code appends an element to the `pattern` list. The element is determined by the expression `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]`. Here, `i % 2` alternates between 0 and 1, and `^ 1` flips the bit, so the expression effectively alternates between 1 and 0. This means the expression `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]` alternates between 'B' and 'A'. 

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we can only say that the new element appended to `pattern` will be either 'A' or 'B', depending on the value of `i`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 2, `pattern` is a list with two additional elements where the last element is either 'A' or 'B'.**
