You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` takes no arguments but operates on input provided through standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if (len(nums) == 1) :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program returns Alice
    #State: `N` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the unique numbers from the input line, and the length of `nums` is greater than 1.
    if (len(nums) == 2) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program returns None because `print('Bob')` outputs 'Bob' to the console and does not return a value.
    #State: `N` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the unique numbers from the input line, and the length of `nums` is greater than 2.
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: N is unchanged; nums is unchanged; cd is the count of consecutive elements in nums (starting from index 0) where the difference between consecutive elements is 1.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program returns None because `print('Bob')` outputs 'Bob' to the console and returns None.
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program returns None, as the print function returns None and Alice is printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any explicit parameters. It reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it evaluates the number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. The function either prints "Alice" or "Bob" to the console based on the evaluation, but it does not return any value. If "Alice" is printed, the function returns `None`. If "Bob" is printed, the function also returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns Alice

Case_2: The program returns None because `print('Bob')` outputs 'Bob' to the console and does not return a value.

Case_3: The program returns None because `print('Bob')` outputs 'Bob' to the console and returns None.

Case_4: The program returns None, as the print function returns None and Alice is printed to the console.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
