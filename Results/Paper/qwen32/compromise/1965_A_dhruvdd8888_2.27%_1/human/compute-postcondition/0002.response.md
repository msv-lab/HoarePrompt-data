The code snippet converts the set of strings `nums` into a list of integers, sorts this list in ascending order, and reassigns it back to `nums`. The value of `N` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the unique numbers from the input line.**
