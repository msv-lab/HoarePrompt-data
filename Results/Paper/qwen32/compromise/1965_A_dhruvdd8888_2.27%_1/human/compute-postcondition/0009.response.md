The code `nums.insert(0, 0)` inserts the value `0` at the beginning of the list `nums`. This means the length of `nums` will increase by 1, and all the original elements in `nums` will be shifted one position to the right. The value of `N` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the unique numbers from the input line with `0` inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is greater than 3.**
