Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum difference \( D \) that Vasya can obtain. The logic in the program is flawed in how it selects elements from the array \( b \) to maximize the total difference.

Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Selection of Elements from \( b \)**: The program sorts the array \( a \) in ascending order and the array \( b \) in descending order. It then tries to match elements from \( a \) with elements from \( b \) in a way that maximizes the difference. However, the logic used to decide whether to use the largest remaining element of \( b \) or the smallest remaining element of \( b \) (in the reversed order) is incorrect.

2. **Greedy Approach Misapplication**: The greedy approach used in the program is not optimal. The program does not consider all possible combinations of elements from \( b \) to match with elements from \( a \) in a way that maximizes the difference.

The correct approach would be to sort both arrays and then use a strategy that ensures the maximum possible difference, such as pairing the smallest element of \( a \) with the largest element of \( b \), the second smallest element of \( a \) with the second largest element of \( b \), and so on.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = 0
        # Use the largest m-n elements of b and the smallest n elements of b
        for i in range(n):
            ans += abs(a[i] - b[m - n + i])
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected program sorts the arrays \( a \) and \( b \), and then calculates the maximum difference by pairing the smallest elements of \( a \) with the largest elements of \( b \) that are available.
