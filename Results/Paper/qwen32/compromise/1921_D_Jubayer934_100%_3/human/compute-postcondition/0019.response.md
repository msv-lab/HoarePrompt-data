Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is `i`; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, except that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
