The code snippet appends a new element to the list `ans`. The new element is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. Given that `i` is `n`, the index `i` is out of bounds for the list `a` because `a` has only `n` elements (indices 0 to `n-1`). However, we can infer the intention of the code and proceed with the calculation based on the provided state.

Since `i` is `n`, `a[i]` would be out of bounds, but we assume the intention is to append the difference for the last valid index of `a`, which is `a[n-1]`. Similarly, `b[-(n - i)]` would be `b[-(n - n)]` or `b[0]` because `i` is `n`.

Thus, the new element appended to `ans` is `abs(a[n-1] - b[0])`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the last element is `abs(a[n-1] - b[0])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is `n`.**
