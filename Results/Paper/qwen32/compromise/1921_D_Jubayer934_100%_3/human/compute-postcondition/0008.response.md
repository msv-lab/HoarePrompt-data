The code snippet `temp = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `temp`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, but it is implied that `i` is an integer used in the context of the lists `a` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is `i`; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order. The condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is true.**
