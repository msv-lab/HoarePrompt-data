The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

From the given information:
- `i` is currently `temp + 1`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is correctly set to the next value it will take, which is simply `i + 1` from its current value.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `temp + 2` (since it was `temp + 1` at the end of the previous iteration and it will be incremented by 1).
- `n` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the loop.

All other variables (`t`, `m`, `temp`, `ans`, `a`, `b`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `temp` is not -1, and `temp` is less than `n`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations, plus the new value `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])` and `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `temp + 2`**
