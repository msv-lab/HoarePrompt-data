Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `temp` is not -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**
