Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is -1; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order. The condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is true.**
