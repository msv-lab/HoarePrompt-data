The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `temp`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `temp` will also be assigned the value 2. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `ans` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, and the second element is `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, and `temp` is 2.**
