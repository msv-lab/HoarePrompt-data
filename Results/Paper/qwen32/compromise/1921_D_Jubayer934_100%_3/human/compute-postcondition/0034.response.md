The code snippet provided reassigns the values of `n` and `m` based on the input. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers, but their specific values are not defined until the input is read. The values of `t`, `temp`, `ans`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is either -1 or an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n; `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, and includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` in the range from `temp` to `n-1` if `temp` is not -1; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**
