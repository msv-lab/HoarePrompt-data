The code snippet initializes an empty list `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `temp` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `temp` is -1; `ans` is an empty list.**
