Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `ans` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, and the second element is `abs(a[i] - b[i])` if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is set to 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is 2.**
