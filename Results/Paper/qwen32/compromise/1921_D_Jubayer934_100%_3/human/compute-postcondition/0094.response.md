To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `temp`, and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `temp` is an integer less than `n`.
- `ans` is a list containing `n+2` elements where the last two elements are `abs(a[n-1] - b[0])` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.
- `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
- `i` is `temp`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `temp`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `temp + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, `ans`, `a`, and `b`) do not need to be modified for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n+2` elements where the last two elements are `abs(a[n-1] - b[0])` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is `temp + 1`**.
