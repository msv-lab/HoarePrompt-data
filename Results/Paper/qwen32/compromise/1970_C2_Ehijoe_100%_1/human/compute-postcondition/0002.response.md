Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighboring nodes, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= `start` <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is the second input integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`.**

In natural language: The `empty` variable has been set to `True`. All other variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`) remain unchanged with their initial values.
