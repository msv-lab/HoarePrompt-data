Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the element of the list `l` at index `i`; `q` is the element of the list `l` at index `p - 1`; `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. If `q` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
