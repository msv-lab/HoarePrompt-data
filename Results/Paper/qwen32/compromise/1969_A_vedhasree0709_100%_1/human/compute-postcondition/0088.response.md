Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1 if `q` equals 2, otherwise `j` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is the element at index 1 of `l`, and `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of `l`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
