Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1 if `q` equals 3 (i.e., `q` equals `i + 1`), otherwise `j` remains 0. `n` is at least 3, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is the element at index 2 of `l`, and `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of `l`. If `q` equals 3, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `j`.**
