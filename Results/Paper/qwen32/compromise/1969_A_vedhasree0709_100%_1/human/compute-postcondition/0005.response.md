To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `i <= n - 1`. The loop will execute if this condition is `True`.

Here are the variables involved in the condition:
- `i`
- `n`

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000 (this variable is not involved in the loop condition and can be ignored for this task).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input (this variable is not involved in the loop condition and can be ignored for this task).
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0 (this variable is not involved in the loop condition and can be ignored for this task).

The condition `i <= n - 1` must be `True` for the loop to execute. Given that `i` is initially 0, the condition simplifies to `0 <= n - 1`, which further simplifies to `n >= 1`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that it is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
