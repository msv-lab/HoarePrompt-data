Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the element of the list `l` at index `i`; `q` is the first element of the list `l`; If `q` is 1, then `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0; `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `p` is updated to be the element of the list `l` at index `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
