Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the integer value of the user's input; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while i <= n - 1:
    p = l[i]
    q = l[p - 1]
    if q == i + 1:
        print(2)
        j = 1
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the first element of the list `l`; `q` is the first element of the list `l`; If `q` is 1, then `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0; `i` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the element of the list `l` at index `i + 1`; `q` is the element of the list `l` at index `p - 1`; `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. If `q` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the element of the list `l` at index `i`; `q` is the element of the list `l` at index `p - 1`; `i` is now `i + 1` and must be less than `n - 1`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `j`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
