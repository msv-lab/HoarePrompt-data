Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4. Each of the following `test_cases` lines contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `test_cases` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases to be processed. All other conditions and constraints provided in the initial state remain unchanged.
