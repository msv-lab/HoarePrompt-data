Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 zeros.**

This means that the variables `t` and `n` retain their initial values, `a` remains the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and a new variable `b` is created as a list containing 26 zeros.
