Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 zeros except `b[x]` which is 2; `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces and must have at least one integer; `r` is a string containing the character at index `x` from `a` concatenated with the character at index `x` from `a` again; `i` is the next element in `s` that has not yet been processed; `x` is the index where `b[x]` is 2.**

In simpler terms, the value at index `x` in the list `b` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
