The value of `t` is incremented by 1. Since `t` is either 0 or 2, after incrementing, `t` will be either 1 or 3. The values of `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is either 1 or 3, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where `cnt[x]` is the number of times `x` appears in `a` for each integer `x` in `a`, and the current value of `i` is `N-1`.**
