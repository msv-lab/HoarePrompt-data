Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown
- `t` is set to 1 if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `t` remains 0.
- `i` is set to `N`.
- `tc` is incremented by `N` (though `tc` is not used in the print statement).
- `N` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cnt` is a `defaultdict` that counts the occurrences of each element in `a`, incremented by the number of times each element appears.
- The condition `(t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0)` is true, meaning either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0.

### Code Snippet
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis
1. **Value of `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is set to `N`. Since `N` is greater than 0, `i` is also greater than 0.
2. **Condition Implications**: The condition `(t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0)` is true. This means either:
   - `t` is greater than or equal to 2, or
   - `cnt[i]` is 0.
3. **Value of `t`**: Since `t` is set to 1 if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, and the condition `(t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0)` is true, it implies that `t` cannot be 1 (as that would make the condition false if `cnt[i]` is not 0). Therefore, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` must be 0.
4. **Implications for `cnt[i]`**: If `cnt[i]` were equal to 1, `t` would be set to 1, which contradicts the condition `(t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0)` being true unless `t` were also set to a value greater than or equal to 2, which is not explicitly stated. Therefore, it's more consistent with the given condition that `cnt[i]` is 0.
5. **Conclusion**: Given the condition and the implications, `i` is `N` and it will be printed as is.

### Final Output
The print statement will output the value of `i`, which is `N`.

Output: **N (where N is a value greater than 0)**
