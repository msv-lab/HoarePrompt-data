Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `N-1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `N` is greater than 0. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
