The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `N`, which means the loop has just finished executing.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be reset to a value less than `N`. The most logical value to reset `i` to would be 0, as this would start the loop from the beginning.

State: **`i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0**
