The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the `cnt` defaultdict by 1. This means that the count of the specific element at index `i` in the list `a` is increased by one.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the updated count of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once.
- `i` is `N-1`.
- `tc` is `tc + 1`.
- `N` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided.
- `cnt` is a defaultdict with the count of `a[i]` incremented by 1.

After the execution of `cnt[a[i]] += 1`, the count of `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `i`, `tc`, and `N` remain unchanged. The list `a` and its elements are also unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the updated count of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `N` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, `cnt` has the count of `a[i]` incremented by 1.**
