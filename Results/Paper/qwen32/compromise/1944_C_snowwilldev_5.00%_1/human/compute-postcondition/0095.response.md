Given the initial state, we know that `i` is 0 and `N` is greater than 0. The behavior of `t` depends on the value of `cnt[i]`, but this does not affect the value of `i` itself. The `print(i)` statement is only concerned with the value of `i`.

Since `i` is explicitly given as 0, the `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **0**
