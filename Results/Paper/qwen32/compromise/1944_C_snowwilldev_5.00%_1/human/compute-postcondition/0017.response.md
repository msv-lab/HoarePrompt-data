Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the condition:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is either 0 or 1.
   - `N` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` where `cnt[x]` is the number of times `x` appears in `a` for each integer `x` in `a`.
   - The current value of `i` is `N-1`.
   - The condition `(t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0)` is true.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - Since `t` is either 0 or 1, `t >= 2` is never true.
   - Therefore, for the condition `(t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0)` to be true, `cnt[i] == 0` must be true.
   - This means that the integer `i` (which is `N-1`) does not appear in the list `a`.

3. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as `N-1`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is `N-1`.

Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement is `N-1`.

Output: **N-1**
