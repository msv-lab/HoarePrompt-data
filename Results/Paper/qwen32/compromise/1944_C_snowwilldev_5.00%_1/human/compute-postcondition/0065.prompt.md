Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `i` is `N`, `tc` is `tc + N`, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, `cnt` is a defaultdict with the count of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N):
    if cnt[i] == 1:
        t += 1
    if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `t` remains 0; `i` is `N`; `tc` is `tc + N`; `N` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided; `cnt` is a defaultdict with the count of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears. If the condition `(t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0)` is true, meaning either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 2 if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `t` remains 1; `i` is 0; `tc` is `tc + N`; `N` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided; `cnt` is a defaultdict with the count of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears; and if `(t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0)`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 3 if `t` was initially 2 and `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `t` remains 2 if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1. If `cnt[i]` is not equal to 1, `t` remains unchanged. `i` is 1, `tc` is `tc + N`, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with the count of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears. Since the else part is not present, the state described in the if part holds true regardless of the condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
