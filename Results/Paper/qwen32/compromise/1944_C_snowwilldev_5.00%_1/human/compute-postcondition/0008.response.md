The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `N` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2, and `N` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value 0 for all keys except `a[0]` which is 1 and `a[i]` which is 2, `i` is 2**
