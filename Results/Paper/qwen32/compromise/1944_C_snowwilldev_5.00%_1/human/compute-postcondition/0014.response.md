Output State: **`t` is 1, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where `cnt[x]` is the number of times `x` appears in `a` for each integer `x` in `a`, and the current value of `i` is `N-1`. Additionally, `cnt[i]` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so `t` is now 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
