The code snippet provided reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `nums`. This action overwrites the previous value of `nums` with the new input list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `last`, and `curr`) are not directly modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is the newly input list of integers, `last` is the last element of the new `nums`, and `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in the new `nums` that are not equal to 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list. If `curr` is 0, then no additional changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.**
