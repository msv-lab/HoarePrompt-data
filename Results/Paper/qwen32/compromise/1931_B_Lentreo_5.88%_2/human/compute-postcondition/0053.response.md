The value of `curr` is updated by adding the difference between `i` and `last`. The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is `nums[-1]`, `i` is `next_element`, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`**.
