Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers.
- `last` is `nums[-1]`, i.e., the last element of the list `nums`.
- `curr` is the sum of all `i - last` for each `i` in `nums` that is not 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list. The current value of `curr` is 0.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print('YES')
```

**Analysis:**
The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr`. The value of these variables does not affect the output of this specific print statement.

**Output:**
Output: **YES**
