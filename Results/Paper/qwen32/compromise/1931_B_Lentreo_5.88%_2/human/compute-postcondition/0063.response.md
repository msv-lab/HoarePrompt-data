Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, `last` is `nums[-1]`, and `curr` is the sum of all `i - last` for each `i` in `nums` that is not 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list. If `curr` is 0, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.**
