The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This will overwrite the previous value of `n`, which was the number of integers in `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is the list of integers read from the input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is the accumulated sum of differences `i - last` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`. If `curr` is 0, no additional changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.**
