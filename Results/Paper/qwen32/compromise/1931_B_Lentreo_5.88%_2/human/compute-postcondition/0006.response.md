To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in nums:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the iterable is `nums`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums` is in a state that allows the loop to execute.

### Analysis:
1. **`nums`**: The loop will execute if `nums` is a non-empty list. If `nums` is empty, the loop will not execute.
2. **`i`**: The variable `i` will take the value of each element in `nums` one by one. Since `i` is not initialized before the loop, we don't need to adjust its state before the loop starts.

### Adjustments:
- Ensure that `nums` is a non-empty list. Since `n` is the length of `nums`, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The state of `t`, `last`, and `curr` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute because `nums` will have at least one element.
