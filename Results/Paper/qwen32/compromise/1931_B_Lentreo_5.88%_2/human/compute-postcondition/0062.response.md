The `print('NO')` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, or `curr`. The statement explicitly prints the string `'NO'`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The variable `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4.
2. The variable `n` is an input integer.
3. The variable `nums` is a list of integers.
4. The variable `last` is the last element of the list `nums` (`nums[-1]`).
5. The variable `curr` is calculated as the sum of all `i - last` for each `i` in `nums` that is not 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list. Additionally, `curr` is not equal to 0.

Despite the detailed description of the variables, the `print` statement does not use any of these variables. It simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
