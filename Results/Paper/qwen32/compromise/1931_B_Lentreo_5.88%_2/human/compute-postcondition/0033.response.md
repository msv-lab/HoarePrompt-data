Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `last` is the last element of `nums` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `nums` after `last`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.**
