Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed.

The program incorrectly calculates the `curr` variable by summing up the differences between each element and the last element of the list, only for non-zero elements. This approach does not account for the correct redistribution of water required to equalize the amounts in all containers.

The correct approach is to check if, by pouring water from left to right containers, we can eventually make all containers have the same amount of water, which is the total sum of water divided by the number of containers. This can be done by iterating through the list and maintaining a running total of the water poured so far, ensuring that at each step, the running total divided by the number of containers processed so far is an integer (i.e., the amount of water that each container should have up to that point).

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total = sum(nums)
        target = total // n
        curr = 0
        can_equalize = True
        
        for i in nums:
            curr += i
            if curr % n != 0:
                can_equalize = False
                break
        
        if can_equalize:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

#State: After all iterations, `t` test cases have been processed. For each test case, "YES" is printed if it is possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers; otherwise, "NO" is printed.
```
In this corrected version, we check if the running total of water in the first `k` containers (`curr`) is divisible by `k` at each step. If it is, it means that the first `k` containers can be made to have the same amount of water. If at any point `curr % k != 0`, it means that equalizing the water in the first `k` containers is not possible, and we print "NO" for that test case.

Correctness: **False**
