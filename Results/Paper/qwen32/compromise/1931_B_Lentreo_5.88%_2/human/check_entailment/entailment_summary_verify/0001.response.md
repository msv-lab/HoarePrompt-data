### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` containers of water.
- The sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
- We can pour water from a container `i` to a container `j` only if `i < j`.
- We need to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate the Target Amount:** The target amount of water each container should have is `total_water / n`, where `total_water` is the sum of water in all containers.
2. **Cumulative Sum Check:** As we iterate through the containers, we need to ensure that the cumulative sum of water up to each container can be evenly distributed up to that point. This means that after processing `i` containers, the cumulative sum should be `i * target_amount`.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The provided code does not follow the correct approach:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `last`:** The variable `last` is set to the last element of the list (`nums[-1]`), which is not used correctly in the logic.
2. **Incorrect Cumulative Sum Logic:** The logic `curr += i - last` is incorrect. It doesn't properly check if the cumulative sum can be evenly distributed up to the current container.
3. **No Target Calculation:** The program doesn't calculate the target amount of water each container should have.
4. **Incorrect Condition for "YES":** The condition `if curr == 0` does not correctly determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

#### Correct Implementation:
Here is a correct implementation based on the above approach:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        target_amount = total_water // n
        curr_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            curr_sum += nums[i]
            if curr_sum != (i + 1) * target_amount:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This implementation correctly calculates the target amount of water each container should have and checks if the cumulative sum up to each container is consistent with the target amount.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect as it does not follow the correct logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers based on the given constraints and operations.
