Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, but only from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

### Key Observations:
1. The sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`, so the target amount of water in each container is `sum(a_i) / n`.
2. The operation allows us to only pour water from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.
3. To achieve equal water distribution, the cumulative sum of water from the first container to the current container should be such that it can be evenly distributed up to that point.

### Correct Approach:
- Calculate the target amount of water each container should have, which is `sum(a_i) / n`.
- Track the cumulative sum of water as we iterate through the containers.
- At each step, check if the cumulative sum is consistent with the target amount of water for the containers seen so far.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
Let's review the code provided:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `last`:** The variable `last` is set to the last element of the list (`nums[-1]`), which is not used correctly in the logic.
2. **Incorrect Cumulative Sum Logic:** The logic `curr += i - last` is incorrect. It doesn't properly check if the cumulative sum can be evenly distributed up to the current container.
3. **No Target Calculation:** The program doesn't calculate the target amount of water each container should have.
4. **Incorrect Condition for "YES":** The condition `if curr == 0` does not correctly determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers based on the given constraints and operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
