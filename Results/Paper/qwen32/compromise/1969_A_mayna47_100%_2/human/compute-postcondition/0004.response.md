To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the provided loop and conditions:

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `n` inclusive. For each `i`, it checks if `v[v[i]] == i`. If this condition is true, it prints `2` and exits the function immediately.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000 (This variable is not affected by the loop).
- `n` is the integer input provided by the user, where 2 <= n <= 50.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct (This variable is not affected by the loop).
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is 0 and the next `n` elements are the integers read from the input.

Since the loop potentially exits early if it finds `v[v[i]] == i`, the output state depends on whether this condition is met during any iteration. If the condition is never met, the loop will complete all iterations without printing `2` and returning.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all iterations, assuming the condition `v[v[i]] == i` is never met, is:

Output State: **the loop completes all iterations without printing `2` and returning, leaving `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` unchanged.**
