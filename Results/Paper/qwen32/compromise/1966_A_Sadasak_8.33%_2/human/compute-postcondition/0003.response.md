Output State: **The program returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.**

This means that for each unique number in the list `arr`, the dictionary `frequency_table` will have that number as the key, and the value will be the smaller of how many times that number appears in `arr` and the integer `k`.
