Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the specified operations. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies**: The `func_1` function is supposed to calculate the frequencies of the cards and limit them to `k`, but it incorrectly updates the frequency table by capping the frequency at `k`. This is not the correct approach to solving the problem. Instead, we need to determine how many groups of `k` cards we can form for each unique card value and then calculate the remaining cards.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards**: The main logic in the loop does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards that can be left. It incorrectly checks if `k` is in the frequency values and returns `k - 1` if true, which is not the correct condition to determine the minimum number of cards.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    remaining_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        remaining_cards += count % k  # Add the remainder of the cards that cannot form a group of k
    
    # We need to ensure that we do not end up with zero cards, so we need at least one card left
    if remaining_cards == 0:
        remaining_cards = 1
    
    print(remaining_cards)
```

This corrected version calculates the remainder of the cards for each unique card value that cannot form a group of `k` and sums these remainders to get the minimum number of cards left. If the sum of remainders is zero, it ensures that at least one card is left.
