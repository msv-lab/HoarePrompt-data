You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of the number of cows `n`, the 1-based index `k` of a specific cow, and a list of the cows' ratings. For each test case, the function identifies up to two cows with ratings higher than the cow at index `k`. Based on the indices of these cows, it returns a value representing the position of the cow with the next higher rating relative to the cow at index `k`, or the total number of cows minus one if no such cow exists.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
We have `n` cows, each with a distinct Cowdeforces rating. The cows compete in a series of `n-1` matches where the cow with the higher rating wins and proceeds to the next match. The task is to maximize the number of wins for a specific cow `k` by optionally swapping it with another cow once.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two main parts:
1. The main loop that handles multiple test cases.
2. The function `func_1(a)` which calculates the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.

The function `func_1(a)` seems to be the core logic. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x = a[k]`: Stores the rating of cow `k`.
   - `ind = []`: List to store indices of cows with ratings higher than cow `k`.
   - `c = 0`: Counter for the number of cows with higher ratings.

2. **Finding Higher Rating Cows**:
   - The loop iterates through all cows.
   - If a cow has a higher rating than cow `k`, its index is added to `ind`, and `c` is incremented.
   - The loop breaks if two such cows are found (`c == 2`).

3. **Determining the Maximum Wins**:
   - If no cow has a higher rating (`ind == []`), cow `k` can win all matches (`return n - 1`).
   - If only one cow has a higher rating (`len(ind) == 1`):
     - If this cow is at index `0`, cow `k` can win up to `k - 1` matches.
     - If this cow is at an index greater than `k`, cow `k` can win up to `ind[0] - 1` matches.
     - Otherwise, cow `k` can win up to `max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)` matches.
   - If two cows have higher ratings (`len(ind) == 2`):
     - If the first cow is at index `0`, cow `k` can win up to `min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)` matches.
     - If the second cow is at an index greater than `k`, cow `k` can win up to `max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])` matches.
     - Otherwise, cow `k` can win up to `max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])` matches.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Global `n` Reference**:
   - The variable `n` is referenced inside `func_1(a)` but is not passed as a parameter. This will lead to a `NameError` because `n` is not defined within the scope of `func_1(a)`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Wins**:
   - The logic for calculating the maximum number of wins is flawed. For example, the case where cow `k` can be swapped to a position where it can win more matches is not handled correctly.
   - The function does not consider the optimal swap position that maximizes the number of wins for cow `k`.

3. **Debugging Print Statement**:
   - The line `if k == 14: print(ind)` is a debugging statement that should be removed or commented out.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect and does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness
Correctness: **False**
