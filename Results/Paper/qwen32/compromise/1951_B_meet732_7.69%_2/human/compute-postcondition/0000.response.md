The code snippet `x = a[k]` assigns the value of the element at index `k` in the list `a` to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, `a` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases, and each test case consists of two parts: a list `[n, k]` and a list of `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The value of `k` is the index of the cow whose rating we are interested in, and it is 1-based.

Since `k` is 1-based, the element at index `k` in the ratings list is `a[k]` (considering the ratings list starts right after the `[n, k]` list for each test case). Therefore, `x` will be assigned the value of the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at the `k`-th position in the ratings list for each test case.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two parts: the first part is a list `[n, k]` where `n` is the number of cows and `k` is your cow's 1-based index, and the second part is a list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being pairwise different. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `x` is assigned the value `a[k]` for each test case.**
