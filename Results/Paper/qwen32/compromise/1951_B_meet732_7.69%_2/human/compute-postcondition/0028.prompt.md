You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two parts: the first part is a list of two integers [n, k] (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) where n is the number of cows and k is your cow's index, and the second part is a list of n integers [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all a_i's being pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` of the list represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is a list of two integers `[n, k]`, where `n` is the number of cows and `k` is your cow's 1-based index, and the second part is a list of `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function returns different values based on the following cases:
#- Case_1: If a certain condition is met, it returns `n - 1`.
#- Case_2: If a different condition is met, it returns `k - 1`.
#- Case_3: If the cow at index `0` has a higher rating than the cow at index `k-1` and is not at index `0`, it returns the 0-based index of that cow minus 1.
#- Case_4: If the cow at index `0` has a higher rating than the cow at index `k-1`, it returns `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the 0-based index of the cow with the higher rating.
#- Case_5: It returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
#- Case_6: It returns the maximum of `(ind[0] - 1)` and `(ind[1] - ind[0])`.
#- Case_7: It returns `k - ind[0]`.
#Only one of these cases is executed based on the conditions provided.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns n - 1, where n is the number of cows in the current test case.

Case_2: The program returns `k - 1`

Case_3: The program returns the index of the cow with a higher rating than `x`, adjusted by subtracting 1 from it. Given that `ind[0]` is greater than `k` and `ind[0]` is not equal to 0, the returned value is `ind[0] - 1`, which is a valid index of a cow whose rating is higher than `x`.

Case_4: The program returns `k - ind[0]`, where `k` is the 1-based index of your cow and `ind[0]` is the 0-based index of the cow with a higher rating.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.

Case_6: The program returns the maximum of (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0])

Case_7: The program returns `k - ind[0]`
