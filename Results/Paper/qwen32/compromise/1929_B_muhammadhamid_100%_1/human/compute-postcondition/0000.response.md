The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of the expression `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the problem statement, the number of test cases `t` is provided as input and must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variables `n` and `k` are related to each test case and are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted here.

State: **The input value `t` must be at least 1**.

Since the loop head does not directly involve `n` or `k`, and the loop will execute based on the number of test cases `t`, we only need to ensure that `t` is at least 1. The values of `n` and `k` will be provided within the loop body and do not affect the execution of the loop itself.
