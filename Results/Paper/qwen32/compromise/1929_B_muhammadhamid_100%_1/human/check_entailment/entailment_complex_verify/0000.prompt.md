You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) where n is the size of the square grid and k is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell.

    #State: The function will have printed the results for each test case based on the provided logic. The value of t will have been decremented to 0 as all test cases have been processed. The variables n and k will hold the values of the last test case processed, but they are not retained outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by the size of a square grid `n` and a minimum number of diagonals `k` that should have at least one colored cell. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of diagonals that need to be colored to meet the requirement.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell in every case. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The logic in the program seems to be based on a heuristic that for `k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2))`, the minimum number of cells to color is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, and otherwise, it is `k // 2 + 1`. However, this heuristic does not accurately account for the structure of the diagonals in an `n x n` grid.

Consider the following test case:
- `n = 3`, `k = 10`

According to the problem description, the grid has `4 * 3 - 2 = 10` diagonals. To ensure that all 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to color 6 cells (as shown in the example output). However, the provided program will output `k // 2 + 1 = 10 // 2 + 1 = 6` for this case, which is correct in this specific example but does not generalize correctly.

However, let's consider another case:
- `n = 4`, `k = 7`

The grid has `4 * 4 - 2 = 14` diagonals. To ensure that 7 diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to color 4 cells. The provided program will output `math.ceil(k / 2) = math.ceil(7 / 2) = 4` for this case, which is correct, but this does not guarantee correctness for all cases.

Let's consider a more complex case:
- `n = 5`, `k = 15`

The grid has `4 * 5 - 2 = 18` diagonals. To ensure that 15 diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to color 8 cells. The provided program will output `k // 2 + 1 = 15 // 2 + 1 = 8` for this case, which is correct, but we need to verify if this heuristic works for all values of `n` and `k`.

The heuristic used in the program does not account for the fact that some diagonals can be covered by coloring the same cell. The correct approach involves a more detailed analysis of how to cover the diagonals with the minimum number of cells. For example, coloring the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal can cover `2 * n - 1` diagonals with `n` cells, and additional cells may be needed to cover the remaining diagonals.

Given the complexity of the problem and the heuristic used in the program, it's likely that there are edge cases where the program does not produce the correct result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, we need a more sophisticated approach that takes into account the structure of the diagonals and how they can be covered with the minimum number of cells.
