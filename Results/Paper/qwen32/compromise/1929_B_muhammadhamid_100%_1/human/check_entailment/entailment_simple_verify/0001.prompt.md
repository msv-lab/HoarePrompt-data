You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) where n is the size of the square grid and k is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell.

    #State: The function will have printed the results for each test case based on the provided logic. The value of t will have been decremented to 0 as all test cases have been processed. The variables n and k will hold the values of the last test case processed, but they are not retained outside the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Grid and Diagonals:**
   - We have an \( n \times n \) grid.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total:
     - \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right.
     - \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.
     - However, the center diagonal is counted twice, so the total is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Objective:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.

### Observations

1. **Minimum Cells for \( k \) Diagonals:**
   - If \( k = 1 \), we need only 1 cell.
   - For larger \( k \), we can consider coloring cells in a way that maximizes the number of diagonals covered by each cell.
   - Each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one from each direction).

2. **Formula Derivation:**
   - If \( k \) is even, we can cover \( k \) diagonals by coloring \( \frac{k}{2} \) cells.
   - If \( k \) is odd, we need \( \frac{k + 1}{2} \) cells.
   - The formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) captures both cases.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - \( k \) can be as large as \( 4n - 2 \), but the formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) will always be valid since it ensures we cover the required number of diagonals with the minimum number of cells.

### Code Analysis

Let's examine the given code:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
```

- **First Condition:**
  - If \( k = 1 \), the code correctly outputs 1.
  
- **Second Condition:**
  - The condition `k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2))` simplifies to `k <= 4n - 4`, which is always true for \( k \leq 4n - 2 \) (since \( k \) is at most \( 4n - 2 \)).
  - If this condition is true, the code outputs \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
  
- **Else Condition:**
  - If the condition is false (which it never will be for valid inputs), the code outputs \( \lfloor \frac{k}{2} \rfloor + 1 \), which is also \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

### Conclusion

The code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells needed to cover at least \( k \) diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid. Therefore, the program is correct.
