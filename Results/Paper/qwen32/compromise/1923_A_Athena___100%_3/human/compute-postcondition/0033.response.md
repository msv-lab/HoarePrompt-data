The code snippet reads an input line, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 999; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
