The loop condition is `a and a[-1] == 0`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as the list `a` is not empty and its last element is 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `a` is a list with the last element removed, we need to ensure that for the next iteration, `a` is not empty and its last element is 0.

To achieve this:
1. `a` must not be empty.
2. The last element of `a` must be 0.

Since the last element was removed in the previous iteration, we need to add a 0 back to the list `a` to ensure the loop condition can be satisfied again.

State: **`a` is a list with the last element removed and a 0 is added back to it**
