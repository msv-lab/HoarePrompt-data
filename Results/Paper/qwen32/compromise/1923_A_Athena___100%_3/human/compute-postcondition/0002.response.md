Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an input integer where 2 <= n <= 50. Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. In each test case, there is at least one a_i that equals 1.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the next integer input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the provided code snippet.
