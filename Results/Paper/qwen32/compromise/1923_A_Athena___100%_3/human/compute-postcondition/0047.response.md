The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the initial state of `a` is `[0]`, after executing `a.pop()`, the list `a` becomes empty.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 999; `n` is an input integer; `a` is `[]`; `res` is 0**.
