The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element of the list `a`. Given that the first element of `a` is 0, this element will be removed, and the list `a` will now start with its second element, which is either 0 or 1.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `res` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 49; `a` is a non-empty list where the first element is either 0 or 1; `res` is 0**.
