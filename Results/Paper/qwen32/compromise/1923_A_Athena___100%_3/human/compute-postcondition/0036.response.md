The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a list starting with 0, after the `pop` operation, the list `a` will be empty.

The other variables `t`, `n`, and `res` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 999; `n` is an input integer; `a` is an empty list; `res` is 0**.
