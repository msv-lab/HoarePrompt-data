#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a single integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}) representing the number of increasing subsequences required for that test case.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1

        return
        #The program returns nothing (None)
    #State: The input consists of a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, where `t` is equal to `x`. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}) representing the number of increasing subsequences required for that test case. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0. Additionally, `x` is not equal to 2.
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens contains the sequence of exponents (decremented by 1) of the powers of 2 subtracted from x in each iteration, and mx is the maximum value of these exponents (decremented by 1).
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the sequence of exponents (decremented by 1) of the powers of 2 subtracted from `x` in each iteration, `mx` is the maximum value of these exponents (decremented by 1), `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1` followed by all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 0
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: 0 1 1 4
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `X` and performs calculations to determine a sequence of integers related to the powers of 2 that sum up to `X`. It then prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself. The function does not return any value.
