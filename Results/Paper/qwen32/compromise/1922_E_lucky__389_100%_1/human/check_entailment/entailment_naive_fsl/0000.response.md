Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Upon analyzing the provided program, it seems to be attempting to construct an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences. The program uses a greedy approach by decomposing X into a sum of powers of 2 and then constructing the array based on these powers. However, there are several issues with the approach:

1. **Incorrect Construction of the Array**: The program constructs the array based on the indices of the powers of 2 but does not correctly ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches X. Specifically, the way the array is constructed does not guarantee that the exact number of increasing subsequences will be X.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where X is not a sum of distinct powers of 2 correctly. For example, if X is 3, the program should output an array that has exactly 3 increasing subsequences, but the current approach does not ensure this.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the array elements on the same line separated by spaces, which is correct per the problem statement, but the logic to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences is flawed.

To illustrate a specific case where the program does not work correctly, consider the input X = 3. The correct output should be an array that has exactly 3 increasing subsequences. One such array is `[0, 1, 0]` which has the subsequences `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[0, 1]`. However, the provided program does not generate this output for X = 3.

Let's test the program with X = 3:
- The program will decompose 3 into powers of 2: `3 = 2^1 + 2^0`.
- The array constructed will be `[0, 1]` (since `mx = 1` and `subseq_lens = [1, 0]`).
- The number of increasing subsequences in `[0, 1]` is 4 (`[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and the empty subsequence), which does not match the required 3 subsequences.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one input case, and the correctness is False.
