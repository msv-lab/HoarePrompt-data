The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `x` is equal to `t` where `t` must be at least 2. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `2 ** i` should be less than or equal to `x`. Since `i` is 2, `2 ** 2` is 4, so `x` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is equal to `x` and `x` must be at least 4, `i` is 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**
