The code appends the value of `subseq_lens[i]` to the list `ansv`. Given that `i` is 3, `subseq_lens[i]` refers to the fourth element of the `subseq_lens` list. Therefore, `ansv` will now include this new element.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` must have at least 3 elements, `mx` is the maximum value of these exponents (decremented by 1), `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and additional elements `subseq_lens[2]` and `subseq_lens[3]`, `i` is 3**.
