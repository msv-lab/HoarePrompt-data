The code snippet provided appends the value of `i - 1` to the list `subseq_lens`. Given the initial state, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2, which means `i` is 2. Therefore, `i - 1` is 1. This value is appended to `subseq_lens`.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is equal to `x`, `x` is not equal to 0, `i` is 2, `subseq_lens` contains the value 1.**
