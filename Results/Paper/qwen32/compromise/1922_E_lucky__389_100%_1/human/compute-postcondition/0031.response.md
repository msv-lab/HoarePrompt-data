The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` changes from 2 to 3. The values of `t` (which is equal to `x` and must be at least 4), and `subseq_lens` (which is an empty list) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is equal to `x` and `x` must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**.
