The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is not equal to 0. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `x` must still be not equal to 0.

No other states need to be adjusted as per the requirement to only modify the objects in the loop head.

State: **`t` is equal to `x`, `x` is not equal to 0, and `i` is the smallest integer such that 2. If the current value of `i` is 0, then `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `x - 2`, `i` is set to 2, `subseq_lens` contains the value 1, and `mx` is at least 1**
