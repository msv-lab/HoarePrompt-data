Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `subseq_lens` contains the sequence of exponents (decremented by 1) of the powers of 2 subtracted from `x` in each iteration.
   - `mx` is the maximum value of these exponents (decremented by 1).
   - `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1` followed by all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Since `x` is 0, no powers of 2 can be subtracted from `x` in any iteration. Therefore, `subseq_lens` will be an empty list (or contain only a single element 0 if we consider the initial state before any iterations).
   - Since `subseq_lens` is empty (or contains only 0), `mx` will be 0 (or -1 if `subseq_lens` only contains 0).
   - `ansv` will be a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1`. Since `mx` is 0, `ansv` will contain integers from 0 to -1, which is an empty list. If `mx` is -1, `ansv` will also be an empty list.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of `ansv` will be 0 because `ansv` is an empty list.

Output: **0**
