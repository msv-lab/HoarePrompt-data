Output State: **The variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last pair of integers input during the loop's execution, and `i` will be equal to `n`. The initial value of `t` and any other variables not affected by the loop will remain unchanged. The program will have printed 'YES', 'NO', or a combination of both based on the conditions evaluated for each pair of integers.**
