### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Handling of Odd Dimensions:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if both `a` and `b` are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. This condition (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`) is correctly handled.

2. **Handling of Half-Dimensions:**
   - The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect. It checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, which is not the only way to form a different rectangle. For example, a rectangle of size `4 x 3` can be cut into two `2 x 3` rectangles and rearranged to form a `3 x 4` rectangle, but the program would incorrectly print "NO" for this case.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if neither of the above conditions is met, a new rectangle can be formed. This is not always true. For example, a `2 x 2` rectangle can be cut into two `1 x 2` rectangles, but rearranging these does not form a new rectangle; it remains `2 x 2` (considering rotations as the same).

4. **Specific Test Cases:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program fails for test cases like `4 x 3` and `2 x 2`. The program should print "YES" for `4 x 3` but prints "NO" due to the incorrect handling of the half-dimension check.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The provided program does not correctly handle all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. Specifically, it incorrectly handles cases where one dimension is not exactly half of the other but can still be cut in a way to form a new rectangle.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
