### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the original assessment and the program to determine its correctness based on the problem description and annotations.

#### Problem Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of its sides and then form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles. Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other.

#### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
- **Cut Parallel to one side**: If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to one of its sides, he can either cut it into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) and \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) (if \( b \) is even) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) and \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) (if \( a \) is even).
- **Form a New Rectangle**: From the two smaller rectangles, Bob can try to form a new rectangle. The only way Bob cannot form a new rectangle is if the resulting two smaller rectangles are \( 1 \times \frac{b}{2} \) and \( 1 \times \frac{b}{2} \) (if \( a = 1 \)) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times 1 \) and \( \frac{a}{2} \times 1 \) (if \( b = 1 \)), which can only form the same rectangle (rotated or not).

#### Key Observations:
- If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because he cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
- If \( a \) or \( b \) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and form a new rectangle unless the resulting smaller rectangles are \( 1 \times \frac{b}{2} \) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times 1 \).

#### Program Analysis:
The program checks the following conditions:
1. **If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd**: It prints "NO" because Bob cannot form a new rectangle.
2. **If \( a / 2 = b \) or \( b / 2 = a \)**: This condition is incorrect. The program checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, but this is not the only condition under which Bob cannot form a new rectangle. For example, if \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 3 \), Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( 3 \times 3 \) rectangles and form a \( 3 \times 6 \) rectangle, which is different from the original \( 6 \times 3 \) rectangle.
3. **Otherwise**: It prints "YES".

#### Issues in the Program:
- The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect. It should not be checking if one dimension is exactly half of the other.
- The program should only check if both dimensions are odd to print "NO". If either dimension is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle.

#### Correctness:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:`. The correct condition should only be checking if both dimensions are odd.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program incorrectly checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, which is not necessary for determining if Bob can form a new rectangle.

Final: **False**
