### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \). He wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. The new rectangle must be different from the original one (considering rotations as the same).

#### Key Points:
1. If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, it's impossible to cut the rectangle into two rectangles that can form a new different rectangle.
2. If one of the dimensions can be divided by 2, it's possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can form a new different rectangle.
3. If the rectangle can be cut in such a way that the resulting two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions, the answer should be "YES". Otherwise, it should be "NO".

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks:
- If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, it prints "NO".
- If \( a / 2 == b \) or \( b / 2 == a \), it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

#### Issues in the Program:
1. The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect because it checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, which is not the only way to form a different rectangle.
2. The program does not correctly handle all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. For example, a rectangle of size \( 4 \times 3 \) can be cut into two \( 2 \times 3 \) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \( 3 \times 4 \) rectangle.

#### Correctness Check:
Let's consider the following test cases:
- \( a = 4 \), \( b = 3 \): The program should print "YES" because the rectangle can be cut into two \( 2 \times 3 \) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \( 3 \times 4 \) rectangle.
- \( a = 2 \), \( b = 2 \): The program should print "YES" because the rectangle can be cut into two \( 1 \times 2 \) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \( 2 \times 2 \) rectangle (which is the same, but the code already handles this case correctly).
- \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \): The program should print "NO" because the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles.
- \( a = 3 \), \( b = 2 \): The program should print "YES" because the rectangle can be cut into two \( 3 \times 1 \) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \( 1 \times 6 \) rectangle.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly handles cases where one dimension is not exactly half of the other but can still be cut in a way to form a new rectangle.

### Final Answer:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the program. The program fails to correctly identify all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**.
