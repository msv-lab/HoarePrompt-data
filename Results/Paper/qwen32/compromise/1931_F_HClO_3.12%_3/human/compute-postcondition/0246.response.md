The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input.**
