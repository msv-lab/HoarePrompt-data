Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are unchanged, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged except `l1` now contains `a1` at the end if `idx1 > idx2`, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` and `idx2` are -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `val` is an empty list if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, and `m` is set to 1. The list `l` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3`, if `idx1 <= idx2`.**
