Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, with `m` decreased by 1 if `idx1 > idx2`; `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input lines, with `l1` modified by inserting `a1` at `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`; `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively; `idx1` is the original `idx1` value plus 1 if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `idx2` is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0; `val` is an empty list if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `m` is equal to 2, the state remains as described above. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify the variables. `a3` is an integer, and `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `idx1 > idx2`, `l` is a list with `a1` inserted at `idx2`. If `idx1 <= idx2`, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l` is a list with `a1` inserted at `idx2`. If `idx1 <= idx2`, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l2` has `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` and `l` is now equal to `l2`.**

This postcondition captures the state of the program variables after the if-else block has executed, considering both possible paths and their respective effects on the variables.
