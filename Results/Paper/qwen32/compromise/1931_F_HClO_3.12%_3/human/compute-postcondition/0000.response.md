Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n * k <= 2 * 10^5. Each of the following k lines contains n distinct integers a_{ij} such that 1 <= a_{ij} <= n, representing the order of participants seen by the participant who posted the screenshot, with a_{i0} being the author of the screenshot and always at the top of the list.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the input statement provided.
