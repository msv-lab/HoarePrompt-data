Postcondition: **`t` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 2; `m` is at least 5; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`; `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, the state remains unchanged. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
