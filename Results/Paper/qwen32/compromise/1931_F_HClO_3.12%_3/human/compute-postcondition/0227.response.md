The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. The loop runs for `m - 2` iterations, and the state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `m` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to account for the fact that `m` has increased by 1, but since `_` is not a state variable, it does not need to be adjusted.

Given the provided state, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is `m` to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0, meaning `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged except `l1` now contains `a1` at the end if `idx1 > idx2`, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged except `l2` now includes `a2` at the end if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` and `idx2` are -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `val` is a list containing three tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `l` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` and the condition `idx1 < idx2`**
