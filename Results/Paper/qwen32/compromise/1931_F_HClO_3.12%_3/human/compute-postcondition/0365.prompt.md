Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` is at least 5; `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22` remain unchanged from their initial values; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is a list containing `m - 2` elements, each a tuple `(a3, l3)`; `l` is adjusted based on the conditions involving `idx1` and `idx2` after each iteration; `a2` is appended to `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2` after each iteration; if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `a1` is inserted at position `idx2` in `l1` and `a2` is inserted at position `idx1` in `l2` based on the index comparison in `l3`.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` is at least 3; `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22` remain unchanged from their initial values; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is a list containing `m - 2` elements, each a tuple `(a3, l3)`; `l` is adjusted based on the conditions involving `idx1` and `idx2` after each iteration; `a2` is appended to `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2` after each iteration; if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `a1` is inserted at position `idx2` in `l1` and `a2` is inserted at position `idx1` in `l2` based on the index comparison in `l3`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no specific action is taken for the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` is at least 3; `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22` remain unchanged from their initial values; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is a list containing `m - 3` elements, each a tuple `(a3, l3)`; `l` is adjusted based on the conditions involving `idx1` and `idx2` after each iteration; `a2` is appended to `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2` after each iteration; if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `a1` is inserted at position `idx2` in `l1` and `a2` is inserted at position `idx1` in `l2` based on the index comparison in `l3`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no specific action is taken for the else part. `a3` and `l3` are the next tuple in `val`. If the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` is true, the loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` is at least 3; `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22` remain unchanged from their initial values; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is a list containing `m - 4` elements, each a tuple `(a3, l3)`; `l` is adjusted based on the conditions involving `idx1` and `idx2` after each iteration; `a2` is appended to `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2` after each iteration; if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `a1` is inserted at position `idx2` in `l1` and `a2` is inserted at position `idx1` in `l2` based on the index comparison in `l3`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no specific action is taken for the else part. `a3` and `l3` are the next tuple in `val`. The loop or if statement is broken if `l3` is not equal to `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
