Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer, and `m` must be at least 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`. The current lists `l11` and `l22` are not equal. The loop has executed `m-2` times, consuming `m-2` lines of input without altering `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, or `l22`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the state remains the same as after the first 3 iterations, except that the loop has consumed `m-2` lines of input as specified. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` are unchanged from their state after the first 3 iterations.
