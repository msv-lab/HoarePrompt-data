The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`. The initial state describes various variables and lists, but the value to be printed is explicitly given in the `print` statement itself, which is `'yes'`.

Here's the breakdown of the information provided:
- `m` is equal to 2.
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines.
- `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input lines.
- `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively.
- `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found.
- `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0.
- `val` is an empty list.
- Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.

However, none of these variables or conditions affect the `print` statement `print('yes')`. The string `'yes'` is a constant value to be printed.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **yes**
