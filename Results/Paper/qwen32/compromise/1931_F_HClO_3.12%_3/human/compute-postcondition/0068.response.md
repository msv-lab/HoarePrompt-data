The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `p2`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, and `idx2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`; If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `i`; `idx2` is equal to `i`; `p2` is 1.**
