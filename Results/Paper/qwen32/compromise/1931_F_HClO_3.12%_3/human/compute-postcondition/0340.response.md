Postcondition: **`t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` remains at least 5 unless `m` was equal to 2, in which case `m` remains 1 and the loop continues to the next iteration; `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged from their initial values; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is an empty list if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `val` is a list containing one more element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`; `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2` or if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1 <= idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l` is equal to `l1` if `a1` comes before `a2` in `l3` or if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise, `l` is equal to `l2`.**
