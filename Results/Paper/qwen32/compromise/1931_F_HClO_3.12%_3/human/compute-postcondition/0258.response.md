Output State: **`t` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`; a new line of input is read but not assigned to any variable.**

Explanation: The `input()` function reads a new line of input, but since its result is not assigned to any variable, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged.
