The code snippet provided creates a new list `l22` that contains elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is 1; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a1` is the first integer from the input line; `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`.**
