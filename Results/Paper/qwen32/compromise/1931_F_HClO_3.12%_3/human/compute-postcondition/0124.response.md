The only variable in the loop head is `t`, as the loop iterates `_` times, where `_` is a throwaway variable. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` has been decremented by 1.

Given that the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is 1**
