Output State: **`t` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration, `n` and `m` retain their input values, `a1` and `l1` remain unchanged, `a2` retains its input value, and `l11` is a new list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`.
