Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer, and `m` must be at least 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`. The current lists `l11` and `l22` are not equal. The loop continues to the next iteration, consuming the next line of input without altering `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, or `l22`.**

In simpler terms: The loop continues to the next iteration without changing any of the variables or lists mentioned.
