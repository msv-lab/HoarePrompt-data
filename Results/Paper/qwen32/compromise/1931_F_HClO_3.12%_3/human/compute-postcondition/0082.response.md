The variable `l` is assigned the value of `l1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines; `l1` is a list with `a1` inserted at `idx2`; `l2` is a list from the input lines; `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively; `idx1` is the original `idx1` value plus 1; `idx2` is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0; `val` is an empty list; `l` is a list with `a1` inserted at `idx2`.**
