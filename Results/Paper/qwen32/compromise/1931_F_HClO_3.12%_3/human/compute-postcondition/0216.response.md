Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val` is an empty list, `m` remains 2 if it was 2, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l` is `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2`. Otherwise, `l` is `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`.**
