Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for determining whether there is a consistent order of participants that matches all given screenshots. The logic seems overly complex and does not account for all possible scenarios. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Handling of Multiple Screenshots**: The program assumes that the first two screenshots are sufficient to determine the order. However, there could be multiple screenshots that need to be considered to find a consistent order.

2. **Insertion Logic**: The logic for inserting the second participant at the correct position in the first list (or vice versa) is flawed. It does not handle cases where the correct position is not immediately after the first mismatch.

3. **General Consistency Check**: After determining a potential order, the program checks if it matches the remaining screenshots. However, the way it constructs the list and checks it might miss some inconsistencies.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when all participants post screenshots or when the number of participants is very small.

A more straightforward approach would be to try to reconstruct the order from the screenshots and then verify if this order is consistent with all the screenshots. Here is a simplified approach that should work correctly:

1. **Reconstruct the Order**: Use the first screenshot to initialize the order. For each subsequent screenshot, try to match it with the current order by rotating the list. If a match is found, update the order. If no match is found, it means the order is inconsistent.

2. **Verify the Order**: After reconstructing the order, verify if it matches all the screenshots.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        orders = []
        for _ in range(k):
            order = list(map(int, input().split()))
            orders.append(order)
        
        # Try to reconstruct the order from the first screenshot
        base_order = orders[0]
        consistent = True
        
        for order in orders[1:]:
            # Find the index of the first element of base_order in the current order
            start = order.index(base_order[0])
            # Rotate the current order to match the base_order
            rotated_order = order[start:] + order[:start]
            if rotated_order != base_order:
                consistent = False
                break
        
        print('YES' if consistent else 'NO')

func()
```

This approach ensures that we correctly reconstruct and verify the order of participants based on the given screenshots.
