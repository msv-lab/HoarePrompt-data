### Reasoning:

The program's logic is based on the observation that the cost to sort a binary string by cyclically shifting substrings is directly related to the pattern of '0's following '1's. Specifically, whenever a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's, the cost is incremented by the number of '1's encountered so far plus one. This is because each such '0' requires a cyclic shift to move it past all the preceding '1's, and the cost of such a shift is the length of the substring being shifted, which is the number of '1's plus one.

Let's break down the logic of `func_1(s)`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to 0. This will accumulate the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to 0. This will keep track of the number of '1's encountered so far.

2. **Iterating through the string**:
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', increment the `one` counter.
     - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it means there are '1's before this '0', so we need to shift this '0' past all the preceding '1's. The cost of this operation is `one + 1` (the length of the substring from the first '1' to this '0' inclusive). This cost is added to `cost`.

3. **Return the cost**:
   - After processing the entire string, the function returns the accumulated `cost`.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the logic with one of the examples provided:

**Example 3**:
- Input: `11000`
- Expected Output: `9`

Processing:
- `s = "11000"`
- `one = 0`, `cost = 0`
- `i = '1'`: `one = 1`, `cost = 0`
- `i = '1'`: `one = 2`, `cost = 0`
- `i = '0'`: `one > 0`, `cost = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3`
- `i = '0'`: `one > 0`, `cost = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`
- `i = '0'`: `one > 0`, `cost = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9`

The calculated cost is `9`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort a binary string by cyclically shifting substrings based on the described logic. Therefore, the program is correct.
