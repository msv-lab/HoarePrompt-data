Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the provided list of integers for that test case.**
