### Reasoning:
The problem requires dividing the books into two non-empty piles and selecting the book with the highest number of pages from each pile to maximize the total number of pages read. The strategy to achieve this is to always pick the two books with the highest number of pages, as these two books will yield the maximum possible sum when selected from the two piles.

The provided program correctly implements this strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of books, `n`.
   - It reads the list of pages for these books.
   - It sorts the list of pages in descending order.
   - It prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list, which correspond to the two largest numbers of pages.

Since the two largest numbers in the sorted list represent the highest number of pages Alice can read from each pile, the program is correct.
