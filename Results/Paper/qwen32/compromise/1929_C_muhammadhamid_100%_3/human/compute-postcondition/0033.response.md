Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `k = 3`
- `x = 5`
- `a = 1`
- `s = 7`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
```

### Explanation:
The code snippet contains a conditional expression inside the `print` function. It evaluates whether `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. 

- `a` is given as `1`
- `s` is given as `7`

The condition `a >= s` translates to `1 >= 7`, which is `False`.

Since the condition is `False`, the expression evaluates to `'No'`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output `'No'`.

Output: **No**
