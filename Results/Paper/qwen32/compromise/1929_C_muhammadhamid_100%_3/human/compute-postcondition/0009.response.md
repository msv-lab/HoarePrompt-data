To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variable `s` evolves with each iteration. The loop runs `x` times, and in each iteration, `s` is updated according to the formula:

\[ s := s + \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 \]

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `k` is the first integer from the input.
   - `x` is the second integer from the input.
   - `a` is the third integer from the input.
   - `s` is initialized to 1.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - **Iteration 1:** 
     \[ s := 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{1}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 = 2 + \left\lfloor \frac{1}{k-1} \right\rfloor \]
     If `k = 2`, then `s = 3`.
     If `k > 2`, then `s = 2`.

   - **Iteration 2:** 
     - If `k = 2`:
       \[ s := 3 + \left\lfloor \frac{3}{1} \right\rfloor + 1 = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 \]
     - If `k > 2`:
       \[ s := 2 + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \]
       (Note: For `k > 2`, `floor(2/(k-1))` is 1 because `2/(k-1)` is less than 2 but greater than 1 for `k > 2`.)

   - **Iteration 3:** 
     - If `k = 2`:
       \[ s := 7 + \left\lfloor \frac{7}{1} \right\rfloor + 1 = 7 + 7 + 1 = 15 \]
     - If `k > 2`:
       \[ s := 4 + \left\lfloor \frac{4}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 \]
       For `k = 3`:
       \[ s := 4 + \left\lfloor \frac{4}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]
       For `k > 3`:
       \[ s := 4 + \left\lfloor \frac{4}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \]
       (Note: For `k > 3`, `floor(4/(k-1))` is 1 because `4/(k-1)` is less than 2 but greater than 1 for `k > 3`.)

From the pattern, we can generalize the behavior of `s` for `k = 2` and `k > 2`.

- **For `k = 2`:**
  - `s` follows a pattern where it roughly doubles and adds 1 each iteration.
  - After `x` iterations, `s` can be approximated by a function that grows exponentially.

- **For `k > 2`:**
  - `s` grows more slowly, and the growth pattern depends on the specific value of `k`.
  - After `x` iterations, `s` can be approximated by a function that grows linearly or polynomially, depending on `k`.

Given the complexity, we need to compute the exact value of `s` after `x` iterations for a general `k`. However, for the sake of this problem, we will assume the pattern observed in the first few iterations continues.

Let's compute the final value of `s` after `x` iterations for `k = 2` and a general `k > 2`:

- **For `k = 2`:**
  - The value of `s` after `x` iterations can be computed using the formula for exponential growth.

- **For `k > 2`:**
  - The value of `s` after `x` iterations can be computed using an iterative approach.

Given the complexity, let's assume the final value of `s` after `x` iterations can be computed as follows:

- If `k = 2`, `s` after `x` iterations is approximately \(2^{x+1} - 1\).
- If `k > 2`, `s` after `x` iterations can be computed iteratively.

For simplicity, let's assume the final value of `s` after `x` iterations is computed using the iterative approach for any `k`.

Here is the Python code to compute the final value of `s`:

```python
def compute_final_s(k, x):
    s = 1
    for _ in range(x):
        s += s // (k - 1) + 1
    return s

# Example usage:
k = 2  # Example value for k
x = 3  # Example value for x
final_s = compute_final_s(k, x)
print(final_s)
```

Let's compute the final value of `s` for a general `k` and `x`:

```python
# General computation for any k and x
def compute_final_s(k, x):
    s = 1
    for _ in range(x):
        s += s // (k - 1) + 1
    return s

# Example usage with general k and x
k = 3  # Example value for k
x = 3  # Example value for x
final_s = compute_final_s(k, x)
print(final_s)
```

Let's compute the final value of `s` for `k = 2` and `x = 3`:

```python
# Specific computation for k = 2 and x = 3
k = 2
x = 3
final_s = compute_final_s(k, x)
print(final_s)
```

The output of the above code for `k = 2` and `x = 3` is `15`.

Therefore, the final output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **s is the value computed by the loop after x iterations.**
