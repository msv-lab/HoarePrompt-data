You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    YES

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the following t lines contains three integers k, x, and a, where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
        
    #State: A series of "Yes" or "No" printed for each of the `t` test cases, where each "Yes" indicates that `a` is greater than or equal to the calculated `s` for that test case, and each "No" indicates that `a` is less than the calculated `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the constraints. The logic in the code seems to be flawed and does not cover all necessary scenarios.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Strategy Logic**: The code uses a strategy where it calculates a threshold `s` based on the number of consecutive losses `x` and the multiplier `k`. It then checks if the initial amount `a` is greater than or equal to this threshold `s`. However, this strategy does not guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n` for all possible sequences of wins and losses.

2. **Calculation of `s`**: The calculation of `s` in the loop:
   ```python
   s = 1
   for i in range(x):
       s += s // (k - 1) + 1
   ```
   This calculation seems to be an attempt to determine a minimum threshold based on the worst-case scenario of consecutive losses. However, it does not account for the multiplicative growth of coins upon winning and the possibility of varying bet amounts after consecutive losses.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, consider the case where `k` is very large. The code might not correctly account for the rapid growth in coins upon winning, which could allow Sasha to achieve any number of coins even with a relatively small initial amount.

4. **Example Counter-Case**:
   Let's consider the test case: `k = 25`, `x = 69`, `a = 231`.
   The code might incorrectly output "NO" for this case because the calculation of `s` might not be sufficient to account for the rapid growth in coins upon winning. However, with an optimal betting strategy, Sasha could still achieve any number of coins.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as simulating the betting strategy or using mathematical analysis to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the constraints.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
