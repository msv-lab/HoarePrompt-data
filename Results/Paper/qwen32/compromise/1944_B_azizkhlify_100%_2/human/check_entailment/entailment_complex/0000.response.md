### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by dividing the array `a` into two halves and then constructing the arrays `l` and `r` as per the problem requirements.

1. **Initialization and Counting:**
   - The program initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of size `n` to count the occurrences of each number in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
   - It iterates over the first half of `a` to populate `l` and the second half to populate `r`.

2. **Constructing `l`:**
   - The program first prints pairs of numbers from the first half of `a` that appear exactly twice. This ensures that the XOR of these pairs is zero, which simplifies the problem.
   - If the number of printed elements reaches `2k`, it stops printing.

3. **Handling Remaining Elements in `l`:**
   - If not enough elements have been printed to reach `2k`, the program prints additional unique elements from the first half until `2k` elements are printed.

4. **Constructing `r`:**
   - The program then prints elements from the second half that appear exactly twice until the count of printed elements in `l` and `r` are equal.

5. **Ensuring Correctness:**
   - The program ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r` by balancing the counts of printed elements and ensuring that pairs that appear twice contribute zero to the XOR.
   - The program guarantees that the output arrays `l` and `r` are subsets of the respective halves of `a` and that their XOR values are equal.

### Correctness:

The program follows a logical approach to construct the arrays `l` and `r` such that their XOR values are equal. It handles the constraints and requirements of the problem effectively.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
