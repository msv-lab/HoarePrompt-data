The code snippet `re += 1` increments the variable `re` by 1. According to the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. The variable `re` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it is assumed to be initialized to some value before this line of code is executed. After the code snippet, the value of `re` will be one more than its previous value. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `re` is incremented by 1.**
