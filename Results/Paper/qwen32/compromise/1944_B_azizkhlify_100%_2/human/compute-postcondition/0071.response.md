Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is non-zero if the if condition is true; `a` is a list of integers; `l` is a list of `n` integers; `ul` is `k * 2` if the loop broke early, or `2 * count` if the loop completed all iterations, where `count` is the number of times a number with a count of 2 was found in `l`; `ur` remains unchanged; `r` is a list of `n` integers; `re` is either `k` if the loop broke early, or less than `k` if the loop completed all iterations; `res` is a list of elements from `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` up to the point where `re` equals `k` if the loop broke early, or up to the last iteration if the loop completed all iterations; `i` is `n-1` if the loop completed all iterations, or the value where `ul` reached `k * 2` if the loop broke early. If `k` is zero, then none of the actions within the if block are performed.**
