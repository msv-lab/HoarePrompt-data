Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` remains the same, `res` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero, `l` has elements set to 0 where `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2 during the loop, `r` remains the same, `re` remains the same, `ul` is the total count of 2s encountered in `l[a[i] - 1]` times 2, `ur` remains the same, `i` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` remains the same, `res` has an additional element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero, `l` has elements set to 0 where `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2 during the loop, and if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, it is also set to 0, `r` remains the same, `re` is incremented by 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `ul` is the total count of 2s encountered in `l[a[i] - 1]` times 2, `ur` remains the same. If `re` equals `k`, the loop is terminated.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` remains the same, `res` has an additional element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero, `l` has elements set to 0 where `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2 during the loop, and if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, it is also set to 0, `r` remains the same, `re` is incremented by 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `ul` is the total count of 2s encountered in `l[a[i] - 1]` times 2, `ur` remains the same. If `re` equals `k`, the loop is terminated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` remains the same, `res` has an additional element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero, `l` has elements set to 0 where `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2 during the loop, and if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, it is also set to 0, `r` remains the same, `re` is incremented by 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `ul` is the total count of 2s encountered in `l[a[i] - 1]` times 2, `ur` remains the same, `i` is `i + 1`. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
