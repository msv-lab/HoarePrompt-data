The code snippet `r = [0] * n` creates a new list `r` consisting of `n` zeros. This means the variable `r` is updated to be a list of `n` zeros, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k` retain their previous values; `l` is a list of `n` zeros; `r` is a list of `n` zeros.**
