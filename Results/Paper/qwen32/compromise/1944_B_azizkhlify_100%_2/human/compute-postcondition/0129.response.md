The provided loop in the task is:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head only contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`. The state of `i` and `n` are the only ones that can be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

Given the task description, the loop is expected to iterate from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `0`. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because the `range(n)` function will automatically initialize `i` to `0` at the start of the loop.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `n` must be greater than `0` to ensure the loop executes.
- `i` does not need to be adjusted as it is controlled by the `range` function.

Thus, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
