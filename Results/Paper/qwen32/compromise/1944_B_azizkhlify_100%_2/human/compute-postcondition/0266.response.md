The code snippet `res.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. This means that the list `res` will now have one additional element, which is `a[i]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `a` remains the same.
- `res` has an additional element `a[i]`.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero.
- `l` has elements set to 0 where `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2 during the loop, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.
- `r` remains the same.
- `re` is incremented by 1.
- `ul` is the total count of 2s encountered in `l[a[i] - 1]` times 2.
- `ur` remains the same.

Output State: **`a` remains the same, `res` has an additional element `a[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero, `l` has elements set to 0 where `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2 during the loop and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `r` remains the same, `re` is incremented by 1, `ul` is the total count of 2s encountered in `l[a[i] - 1]` times 2, `ur` remains the same.**
