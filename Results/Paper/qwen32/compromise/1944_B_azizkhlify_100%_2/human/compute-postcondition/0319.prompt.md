Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: the printout of all elements in `res`, `ul` is not equal to `ur`. The current value of `ul` is different from the current value of `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 or 2, `a` is a list of integers, and if `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 or 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `n + 1`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged and the loop or if statement continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` is either 0 or 2, `a` is a list of integers, and `i` is `n + 2`. If `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` in `r` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` in `r` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
