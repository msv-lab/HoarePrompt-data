The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the range they define. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n + 2`. The values of `n`, `r`, `a`, and the conditions involving `ul` and `ur` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 or 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `n + 2`**
