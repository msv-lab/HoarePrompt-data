To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the given information.

The loop iterates from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`. The loop checks if `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2. If it is, it prints `a[i]` twice, sets `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0, and increments `ur` by 2. The loop will break if `ul` equals `ur` at any point.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

- After 1st iteration: `i` is `n`. If `r[a[n] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is incremented by 2.
- After 2nd iteration: `i` is `n + 1`. If `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is incremented by 2.
- After 3rd iteration: `i` is `n + 2`. If `r[a[n + 2] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is incremented by 2.

The loop will continue until `i` reaches `2 * n - 1` or until `ul` equals `ur`.

The final output state will be when the loop either completes all iterations (i.e., `i` reaches `2 * n - 1`) or `ul` equals `ur`.

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop will iterate from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`.
- For each `i`, it checks if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2. If true, it prints `a[i]` twice, sets `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0, and increments `ur` by 2.
- The loop will terminate if `ul` equals `ur` at any point during the iterations.
- If `ul` never equals `ur`, the loop will complete all iterations, and `i` will be `2 * n - 1`.

### Output State:
The final output state will be:
- `i` will be `2 * n - 1` if the loop completes all iterations.
- `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the loop breaks early due to `ul` equaling `ur`.

Given the constraints and the behavior of the loop, the final output state is:

Output State: **i is 2 * n - 1, and ul is not equal to ur unless the loop breaks early.**
