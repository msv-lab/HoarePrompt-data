The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. This means that `i` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `2 * n`.

Given that `i` is currently `i + 1` (from the previous iteration), we need to adjust `i` to be this value at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`**
