To determine the output of the provided print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `i + 1`. This statement suggests that `i` is being incremented by 1, but it does not specify the initial value of `i`. Therefore, we can denote the initial value of `i` as `i_initial`, and after the increment, `i` becomes `i_initial + 1`.
- The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume its existence and contents.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

- The print statement accesses the element at index `i` in the list `a` twice and prints it, with a space at the end.

### Output Determination:
To determine the output, we need to know the value of `i` and the contents of the list `a`.

- Since `i` is incremented by 1, the value of `i` is `i_initial + 1`.
- The list `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `a[i]`. However, we can denote the value of `a[i]` as `a[i_initial + 1]`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the value of `a[i_initial + 1]` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[i_initial + 1] a[i_initial + 1] (where i_initial is the initial value of i and a[i_initial + 1] is the element at index i_initial + 1 in the list a)**
