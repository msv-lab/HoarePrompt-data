Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `re` equals `k`, `res` includes all elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1 up to the point where `re` equals `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `t`, `n`, `re`, and `res` remain unchanged, but the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
