The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. This means that if `i` was 0 at the start of the last iteration, it is now 1, and so on. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Since `n` is given to be greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next value it should take in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

If `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, it is `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration, adjusting only `i` and `n` (as per the loop head), is:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1** (implying `i` is now `previous_i + 1`)

Since we need to be precise and not assume the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**
