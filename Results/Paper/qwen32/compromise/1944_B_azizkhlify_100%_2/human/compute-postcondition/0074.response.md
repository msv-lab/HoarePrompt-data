To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's carefully analyze the provided initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 0.
3. **`k`**: Initially defined as \(2 * k - ul\), but this seems circular and ambiguous. It's also mentioned that `k` is non-zero if a certain if condition is true.
4. **`a`**: A list of integers.
5. **`l`**: A list of `n` integers.
6. **`ul`**: 
   - `k * 2` if the loop broke early.
   - `2 * count` if the loop completed all iterations, where `count` is the number of times a number with a count of 2 was found in `l`.
7. **`ur`**: Remains unchanged (not directly relevant to the print statement).
8. **`r`**: A list of `n` integers.
9. **`re`**: 
   - `k` if the loop broke early.
   - Less than `k` if the loop completed all iterations.
10. **`res`**: A list of elements from `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` and contains at least one element.
11. **`i`**: 
    - `n-1` if the loop completed all iterations.
    - The value where `ul` reached `k * 2` if the loop broke early.

### Key Points to Determine `i`:
- The value of `i` depends on whether the loop completed all iterations or broke early.
  - If the loop completed all iterations, `i` is `n-1`.
  - If the loop broke early, `i` is the value where `ul` reached `k * 2`.

### Output Analysis:
Since the exact behavior of the loop (whether it completed all iterations or broke early) is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both possibilities:
- **If the loop completed all iterations**: `i` will be `n-1`.
- **If the loop broke early**: `i` will be the value where `ul` reached `k * 2`.

Given the ambiguity without the exact loop behavior, the most precise description we can provide is that `i` is either `n-1` or the value where `ul` reached `k * 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **i (where i is n-1 if the loop completed all iterations, or the value where ul reached k * 2 if the loop broke early)**
