Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: - `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `l` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the loop.
- `r` will have elements incremented based on the values in `a` for indices `n` to `2*n - 1`.
- `re` remains unchanged.
- `ul` remains unchanged.
- `ur` remains unchanged.
- `res` remains unchanged.
- `i` will be `2*n - 1` after the loop completes.

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, `r` will have been updated such that for each index `i` from `n` to `2*n - 1`, the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` will have been incremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `res`) will remain in their initial states. The loop variable `i` will be `2*n - 1` at the end of the loop.

Output State:
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then no further changes are made to `ul`. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ul` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ul` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
