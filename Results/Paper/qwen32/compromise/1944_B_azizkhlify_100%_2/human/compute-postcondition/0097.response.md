The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

Since `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the last iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `n + 2`. The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted as it remains the same for each iteration.

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is a non-negative integer**
