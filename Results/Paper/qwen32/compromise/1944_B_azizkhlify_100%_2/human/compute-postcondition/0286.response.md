Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `res` contains elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1 up to `re == k` if `k` is non-zero. `n` remains the same, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, `l` has elements set to 0 where `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1 or 2, `r` remains the same, `re` is the number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1 up to `re == k`, `ul` is the total count of 2s encountered in `l[a[i] - 1]` times 2, `ur` remains the same, and `i` is the index at which the loop terminated if `k` is non-zero. If `k` is zero, the state of the variables remains as per the precondition.**
