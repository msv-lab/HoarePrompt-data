The variable `ur` is incremented by 2. The values of `n`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, and `ur` is increased by 2.
Output State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `ur` is increased by 2.**
