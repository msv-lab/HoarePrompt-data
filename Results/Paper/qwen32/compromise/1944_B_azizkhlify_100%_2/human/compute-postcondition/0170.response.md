Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `res` contains `a[0]`. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, then `res` also contains `a[1]` and `re` is incremented by 1. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `re` or the loop continues.**
