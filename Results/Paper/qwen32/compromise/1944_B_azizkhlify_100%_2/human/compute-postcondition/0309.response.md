Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 or 2, `a` is a list of integers, and if `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is the previous value of `ur` plus 2. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ur` remains unchanged.**
