The code snippet provided reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `qs`. This means that the original list `qs` is replaced by the new list of integers provided through the input. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `k`, `q`, `t`, and `res`) are not affected by this operation.

Since the new list `qs` is read from the input, the value of `n` (which was previously the last integer in the original `qs`) is now the last integer in the newly input list. The variable `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the original `qs`, and this list is not updated by the new input. The variables `p`, `k`, `q`, and `t` retain their original values.

Output State: **`qs` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the last integer in the new `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the original `qs` appended to it.**
