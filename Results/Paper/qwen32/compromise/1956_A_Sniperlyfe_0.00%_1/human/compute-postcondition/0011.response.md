To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Variables and their initial states:**
   - `n` is the next integer in `qs`.
   - `p` is a list of integers.
   - `k` is the first integer read from the input.
   - `q` is the second integer read from the input.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one more integer.
   - `res` has two additional elements which are the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

2. **The code snippet to analyze:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Explanation of the code:**
   - `map(str, res)`: This converts each element in the list `res` to a string.
   - `' '.join(...)`: This joins all the string elements in the list `res` with a space `' '` as the separator.
   - `print(...)`: This prints the resulting string.

4. **Determine the output:**
   - `res` has two additional elements which are the results of `func_1(n, p)`. This means `res` now contains these new elements.
   - The elements of `res` are converted to strings and joined with spaces.
   - The final output will be a string of the elements in `res` separated by spaces.

Since the exact values of `res` and the results of `func_1(n, p)` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `res`.

Output: **[elements of res separated by spaces] (where elements of res are the results of appending the results of func_1(n, p) to res)**
