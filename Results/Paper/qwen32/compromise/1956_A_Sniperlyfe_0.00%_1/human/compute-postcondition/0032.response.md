The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k` and `q`. The initial state specifies that `k` and `q` are already defined integers read from the input, but the code reassigns them. Therefore, the values of `k` and `q` are updated to the new integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the last integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers, and `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` appended to it.**
