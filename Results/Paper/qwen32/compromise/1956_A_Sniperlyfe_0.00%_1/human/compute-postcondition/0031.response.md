The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable that does not affect the state of the program directly. However, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 1, which means there are still iterations left to execute.

Since `_` does not need to be adjusted and the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, we need to adjust `t` to reflect the start of the next iteration. After one iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is the last integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers, and `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` appended to it.**
