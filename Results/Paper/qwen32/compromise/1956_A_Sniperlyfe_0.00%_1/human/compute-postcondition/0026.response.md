Let's analyze the given information step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is the next integer in the list `qs` after `n_last`.
- `p` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `k` and `q` are two integers read from the input.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers.
- `res` contains the result of `func_1(n_last, p)` and `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `res`**:
   - `res` is a list that contains the results of two function calls: `func_1(n_last, p)` and `func_1(n, p)`.
   - The exact values of these function calls are not provided, so we will describe `res` in terms of these function calls.

2. **Transformation of `res`**:
   - The `map(str, res)` function converts each element in the `res` list to a string.
   - The `' '.join(...)` function then joins these string elements with a space `' '` in between.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The final output will be a single string with the string representations of the elements in `res` joined by spaces.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output a string that consists of the string representations of the results of the two function calls `func_1(n_last, p)` and `func_1(n, p)` separated by a space.

Output: **[result of func_1(n_last, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)] (where [result of func_1(n_last, p)] and [result of func_1(n, p)] are the string representations of the results of the respective function calls)**
