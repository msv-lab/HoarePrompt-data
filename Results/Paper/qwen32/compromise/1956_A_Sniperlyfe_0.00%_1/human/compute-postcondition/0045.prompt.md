Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `qs` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the last integer in the new `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n in qs:
    res.append(func_1(n, p))
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `qs` is a new list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `n` is the first integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `qs` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is the second integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `qs` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 integers, `n` is the third integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing three elements, all of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
