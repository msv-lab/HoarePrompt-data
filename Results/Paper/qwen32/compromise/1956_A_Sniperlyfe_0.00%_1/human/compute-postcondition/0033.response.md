The code snippet provided reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `p`. This operation overwrites the previous value of `p`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `q`, `t`, `qs`, and `res`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the last integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers, and `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` appended to it.**
