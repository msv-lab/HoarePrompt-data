The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has more than one integer, the loop will execute again for the next integer in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, and `n` is the first integer in the list `qs`. For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least 2 integers, and `n` should be the next integer in the list.

State: **`qs` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is the second integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**
