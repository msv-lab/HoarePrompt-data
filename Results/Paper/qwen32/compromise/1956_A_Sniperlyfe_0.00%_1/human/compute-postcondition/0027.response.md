The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If there are more integers in `qs` after the current `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the next integer in the list `qs` after `n_last`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be the next integer in `qs` after the current `n`.

State: **`n` is the next integer in the list `qs` after the current `n`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 1, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `res` contains the result of `func_1(n_last, p)` and `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**
