The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k` and `q`. This means that `k` and `q` will now hold the values of the two integers read from the input, while the other variables `n` and `p` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game, `p` is a list of k integers such that 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
