The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has at least one more integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the last integer that was read from `qs`, `p` is a list of integers, `k` and `q` are the first and second integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, and `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least one more integer, and `n` will be the next integer in `qs`.

State: **`n` is the next integer in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one more integer, `res` has an additional element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**
