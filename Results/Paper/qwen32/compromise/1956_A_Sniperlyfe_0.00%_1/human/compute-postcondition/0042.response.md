The only variable in the loop head is `n`, which is being iterated over the list `qs`. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to the next value in the list `qs` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the second integer in the list `qs`, for the next iteration, `n` should be the third integer in the list `qs` (assuming `qs` has at least three integers).

Since other variables like `p`, `k`, `q`, `t`, and `res` are not in the loop head, we do not need to adjust their states.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`qs` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 integers, `n` is the third integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`**
