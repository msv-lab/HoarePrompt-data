To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the logic described.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly used in the print statement.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 1. This variable represents the upper limit for the loop (i.e., the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`).
3. **`g`**: Initialized to 0. This variable is not used in the print statement.
4. **`v1`**: The largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `'<'`. If no `r` was `'<'`, `v1` is 0.
5. **`prev`**: Initially undefined, but it gets set based on the value of `r`:
   - If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`.
   - If `r` is `'='`, `prev` is set to `i` if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged.
   - If `r` is neither `'>'` nor `'='`, `prev` remains unchanged.
6. **`r`**: The user's input, which can be `'<'`, `'>'`, or `'='`.
7. **`i`**: Incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

This means the output will be formatted as:
```
? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]
```

### Determining the Values:
- **`v1`**: This is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'`. If no such `i` exists, `v1` is 0.
- **`i`**: This is the current value of the loop counter, which ranges from 1 to `n-1`.
- **`prev`**: This depends on the value of `r`:
  - If `r` was `'>'`, `prev` will be the last `i` where `r` was `'>'`.
  - If `r` was `'='` and the previous `r` was `'<'`, `prev` will be the last `i` where `r` was `'='`.
  - Otherwise, `prev` will remain unchanged from its previous value.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `r`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev` are not explicitly provided in the initial state, we can only describe them based on the given conditions.

- **`v1`**: The largest `i` where `r` was `'<'`, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- **`i`**: The current iteration number, which is between 1 and `n-1`.
- **`prev`**: The value of `i` based on the conditions specified for `r`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the largest i for which r was '<', or 0 if no such i exists; i is the current iteration number; prev is the value of i based on the conditions specified for r)**
