The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. Since the initial state specifies that `prev` is 0 and `i` is not explicitly provided, we can only state that `prev` now holds the value of `i`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `prev` is `i`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string, and `r` equals `'>'`.**
