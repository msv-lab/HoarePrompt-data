Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `i + 2` - This suggests that `i` is being incremented by 2, but the initial value of `i` is not provided. Let's denote the initial value of `i` as `i0`. Therefore, `i = i0 + 2`.
2. `v2` is `i + 2` - Given that `i` is `i0 + 2`, then `v2 = (i0 + 2) + 2 = i0 + 4`.
3. `r` is an input string - The value of `r` is not explicitly provided, so we will consider it as a variable `r`.
4. `v1` is `i + 1` if `r` equals `<`, otherwise `v1` is undefined - Since `i = i0 + 2`, `v1 = (i0 + 2) + 1 = i0 + 3` if `r == '<'`.
5. `n` is unchanged - The value of `n` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement formats a string that includes the values of `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`.
- `v1` is defined as `i + 1` if `r == '<'`. Since `i = i0 + 2`, `v1 = i0 + 3` if `r == '<'`.
- `v2` is defined as `i + 2`, so `v2 = i0 + 4`.
- If `r` is not equal to `<`, `v1` is undefined, and the print statement will result in an error because it tries to print an undefined variable.

### Conclusion:
- If `r == '<'`, the output will be `? i0+3 i0+3 i0+4 i0+4`.
- If `r != '<'`, the program will raise an error because `v1` is undefined.

Since the problem does not specify the value of `r`, we must consider both possibilities. However, based on the precondition provided, we can assume that `r` might be `<` for the print statement to execute without error.

### Output:
Assuming `r == '<'`:
Output: **? i0+3 i0+3 i0+4 i0+4 (where i0 is the initial value of i)**

If `r != '<'`, the output would be an error, but we will adhere to the format requested for the given precondition.

Output: **? i0+3 i0+3 i0+4 i0+4 (where i0 is the initial value of i)**
