The code assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `prev`, `kp`, `g`, and `v1` remain unchanged. The value of `v2` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is an integer value greater than 1, `prev` is the value determined by the user's inputs throughout the `n-1` iterations of the loop, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`**.
