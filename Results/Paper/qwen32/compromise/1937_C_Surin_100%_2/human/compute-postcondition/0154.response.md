Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is an integer value greater than 1, `prev` is the value determined by the user's inputs throughout the `n-1` iterations of the loop, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the value of the user's input, and `r` equals `'<'`.**

Explanation: The value of `v1` is updated to be equal to `v2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
