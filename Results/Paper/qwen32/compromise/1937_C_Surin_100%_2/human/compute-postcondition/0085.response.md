The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables for the next iteration of the loop to execute.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0
- `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`
- `kp` is incremented by 1
- `v2` is `i`
- `r` is the input string

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has taken a specific value, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain the same (since it's the upper bound of the loop).

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the input string, `i` is incremented by 1**.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**.
