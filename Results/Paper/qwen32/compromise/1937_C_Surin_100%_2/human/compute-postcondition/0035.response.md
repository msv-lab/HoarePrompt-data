The code snippet provided is `prev = i`. This line assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. However, the initial state does not specify a value for `i`. Therefore, we can only state that `prev` will now hold the value of `i`.

Given the initial state and the provided code:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0
- `prev` is 0
- `r` is the user's input, and `r` is equal to `'>'`

After executing `prev = i`, the value of `prev` changes to the value of `i`, but `i` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only say that `prev` now holds the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0, `prev` is `i`, `r` is `'>'`**.
