To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `n`. 

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i+1`, `v2` is `i+1`, and `r` is an input string. If `r` equals `<`, then `v1` is also `i+1`. Otherwise, `v1` remains undefined.
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`.

To proceed with the next iteration:
- The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- The value of `n` does not change as it is the upper bound of the range and is not modified within the loop.

Let's adjust the states:
- Since `i` is `i+1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i+2` (since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration).
- The value of `v2` and `r` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
- The value of `v1` remains unchanged as well since it is not part of the loop head and its value depends on the condition `r == '<'`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `i+2`, `v2` is `i+1`, `r` is an input string, `v1` is `i+1` if `r` equals `<`, otherwise `v1` remains undefined, `n` is unchanged**. 

To simplify and make it clear:
State: **`i` is `i+2`, `v2` is `i+1`, `r` is an input string, `v1` is `i+1` if `r` equals `<`, otherwise `v1` is undefined, `n` is unchanged**.
