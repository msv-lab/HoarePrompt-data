The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` to a new variable `prev`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 before this assignment according to the initial state, but since the increment operation is not shown in the provided code snippet, we only reflect the assignment operation in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is the value of `input()`, `prev` is the value of `i` before it was incremented.**
