The code assigns the value of the next input to the variable `r2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is the value of `input()`, `r2` is the value of the next `input()`**.
