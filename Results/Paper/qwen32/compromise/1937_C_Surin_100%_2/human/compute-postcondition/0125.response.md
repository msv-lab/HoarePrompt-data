The code assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `prev`. The values of `t`, `n`, `r`, and `r2` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is not changed by this assignment, but `prev` now holds the same value as `i`.

Output State: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1, `r2` is the value provided by the user as input, `prev` is equal to `i`.**
