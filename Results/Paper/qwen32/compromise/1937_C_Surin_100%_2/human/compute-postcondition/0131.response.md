The provided code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any of the variables `t`, `n`, `r`, or `i` directly. It is a function call that flushes the internal buffer of the standard output to ensure that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. This operation does not change the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `i` was mentioned to be incremented by 1, but the provided code snippet does not reflect this increment. Therefore, we will assume that the increment operation was meant to be part of a previous line of code and is not affected by `sys.stdout.flush()`.

Output State: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1**.
