Output State: **`t` is some value, `prev` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `r` is not equal to '>', and `r` is equal to '='.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the standard output. Therefore, the values of `t`, `prev`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged.
