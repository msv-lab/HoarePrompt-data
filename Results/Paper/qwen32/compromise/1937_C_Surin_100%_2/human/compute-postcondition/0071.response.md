To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and understand the definitions of the variables `prev` and `v1`.

### Definitions and Initial State:
- `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `'<'`. If no such `r` was found, `v1` is 0.
- `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was either `'>'` or `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`.

### Explanation:
The `print` statement outputs a formatted string containing the values of `prev` and `v1`.

#### `v1`:
- `v1` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the input `r` was `'<'`. If there was no such `r`, `v1` is 0.
- This means `v1` could be any integer from 0 to `n-1`, depending on the sequence of `r` values.

#### `prev`:
- `prev` is the last index `i` where `r` was either `'>'` or `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`.
- This means `prev` could be any integer from 1 to `n-1`, depending on the sequence of `r` and `r2` values.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output `! prev v1` where `prev` and `v1` are determined based on the conditions described above.

Since the exact sequence of `r` and `r2` values is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `prev` and `v1`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where prev is the last i for which r was '>' or '=' and r2 was '<', and v1 is the largest i for which r was '<')**
