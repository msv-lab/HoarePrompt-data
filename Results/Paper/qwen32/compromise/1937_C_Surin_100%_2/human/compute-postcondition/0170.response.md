To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. In each iteration:
- `v2` is set to the current value of `i`.
- The program prints a formatted string and waits for user input.
- If the input (`r`) is `'<'`, `v1` is updated to the current value of `i`.

The loop runs `n-1` times. After all iterations:
- `i` will have taken on all values from `1` to `n-1`.
- `v2` will be the last value of `i` it was set to, which is `n-1`.
- `v1` will be the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`. If the input was never `'<'`, `v1` will retain its initial value of `0`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `prev`, `kp`, `g`) remain unchanged as per the problem description.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `prev` is the value determined by the user's inputs throughout the `n-1` iterations of the loop, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `v2` will be `n-1`, `v1` will be the last iteration index where the user input was `'<'`, and all other variables not directly involved in the loop will remain as they were initially.
