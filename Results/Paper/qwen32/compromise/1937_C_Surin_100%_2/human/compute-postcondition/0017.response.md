The provided code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` is a command used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the standard output device immediately. This command does not affect the values of variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `v2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `v2` is `i + 1`**.
