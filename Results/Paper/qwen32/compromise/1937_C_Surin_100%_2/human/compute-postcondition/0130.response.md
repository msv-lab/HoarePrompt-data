To determine what will be printed in the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and the variables involved in the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is some value (not explicitly defined, so we can't determine its exact value).
- `n` is greater than 1 (an integer).
- `r` is the value provided by the user (not explicitly defined, so we can't determine its exact value).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (we know that `i` has been incremented by 1, but its initial value is not provided, so we can't determine its exact value).
- `v1` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can't determine its exact value.
- `prev` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can't determine its exact value.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
- The placeholders `{v1}`, `{i}`, and `{prev}` will be replaced by the actual values of the variables `v1`, `i`, and `prev` respectively.
- Since the values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe them in terms of what is known about them.

### Conclusion:
- `v1` is some value (unknown).
- `i` is some value that has been incremented by 1 (unknown initial value, but we know it has been incremented).
- `prev` is some value (unknown).

Therefore, the output will be in the format `? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]` where `[v1]`, `[i]`, and `[prev]` represent the actual values of the variables `v1`, `i`, and `prev` respectively.

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where [v1] is the value of v1, [i] is the value of i after being incremented by 1, and [prev] is the value of prev)**
