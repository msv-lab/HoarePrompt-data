Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i+2`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1, the output buffer is flushed, `prev` is set to the new value of `i`, `r2` is set according to the conditions`**

In this output state, the variable `prev` is updated to hold the new value of `i` after `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values or states as specified in the initial conditions.
