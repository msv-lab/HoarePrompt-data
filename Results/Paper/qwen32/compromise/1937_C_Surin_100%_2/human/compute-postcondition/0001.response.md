The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. The initial state includes the integer `t` and for each test case, the integer `n` and a secret permutation `p`. The lambda function `I` is already defined in the initial state and is not affected by the new lambda function `R`.

The code does not modify `t`, `n`, or the permutation `p`. It only defines a new lambda function `R`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the new lambda function `R`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and there exists a secret permutation `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}; `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, returning the result as a list; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.**
