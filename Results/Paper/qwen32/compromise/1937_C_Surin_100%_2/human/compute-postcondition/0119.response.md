The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not change the values of any variables; it only flushes the output buffer to ensure that all output is written to the console. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1**.
