The code snippet `r2 = input('')` prompts for a new input and assigns it to the variable `r2`. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state, except for adding `r2` as a new variable with the value of the new input.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than 1, `prev` is 0, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string, `r` is not `'>'`, and `r` is equal to `'='`, `r2` is the new input string.**
