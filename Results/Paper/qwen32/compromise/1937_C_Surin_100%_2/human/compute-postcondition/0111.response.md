The code snippet provided is `r2 = input('')`, which means `r2` will be assigned the value of whatever the user inputs next. The other variables (`t`, `prev`, `n`, and `r`) are not affected by this line of code. Since `r` is already specified to be equal to `'='` and not equal to `'>'`, these conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is some value, `prev` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is '=', `r2` is the value provided by the user.**
