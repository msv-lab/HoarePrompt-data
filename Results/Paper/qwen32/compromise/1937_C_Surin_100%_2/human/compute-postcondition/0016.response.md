Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `i + 1`: This statement suggests that `i` is being incremented by 1. However, it doesn't provide the initial value of `i`. For the sake of understanding, let's assume `i` was initially some value, say `x`, so now `i` is `x + 1`.
2. `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`: This tells us that `n` is greater than the current value of `i`, which is `x + 1`. So, `n > x + 1`.
3. `v2` is `i + 1`: Since `i` is `x + 1`, `v2` becomes `(x + 1) + 1` which is `x + 2`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its value directly. To provide a precise answer, we need to acknowledge that `v1` is an undefined variable.
- `v2` is defined as `i + 1`. Since `i` is `x + 1`, `v2` is `x + 2`.

### Output:
Given that `v1` is undefined, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for it. However, we know the value of `v2` in terms of `x`.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [x + 2] [x + 2] (where v1 is an undefined variable and x is the initial value of i before incrementing)**
