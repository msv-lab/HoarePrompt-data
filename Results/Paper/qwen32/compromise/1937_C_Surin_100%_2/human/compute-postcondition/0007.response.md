The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `v2` after the assignment. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`**.
