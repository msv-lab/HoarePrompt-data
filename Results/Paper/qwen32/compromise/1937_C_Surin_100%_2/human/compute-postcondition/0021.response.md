The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`.

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `(i + 1) + 1` or `i + 2` at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i + 2`.

The states `v2`, `r`, and `v1` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 2`**
