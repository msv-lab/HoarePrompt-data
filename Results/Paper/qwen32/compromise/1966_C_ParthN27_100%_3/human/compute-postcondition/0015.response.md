The variable `n` is updated to be the length of the list `s`. The length of `s` is determined by the number of unique elements in `arr` plus one (for the initial `0` element). The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list with `0` as the first element, followed by all unique elements from `arr`, `ans` is 1.**
