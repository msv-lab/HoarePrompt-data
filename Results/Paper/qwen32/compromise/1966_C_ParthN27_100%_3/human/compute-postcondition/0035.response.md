The initial state provides information about the variable `ans`, which is set to 1 if `n-2` is even. However, the value of `n` is not specified, and the `print` statement does not reference `ans` or any other variable that depends on `n`. Instead, it simply prints the string 'Alice'.

Therefore, the execution of the `print` statement will output the string 'Alice' without any dependency on the value of `n` or `ans`.

Output: **Alice**
