The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Bob'. The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely dependent on the `print('Bob')` statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`**: An integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
2. **Variable `n`**: The length of the sorted list `s` with `0` prepended.
3. **Variable `arr`**: A list of integers read from the input.
4. **Variable `s`**: A sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended.
5. **Variable `ans`**: Set to 0 if `n-2` is odd.

None of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
