The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `ans` with the value `1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `s` are not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `ans` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list with `0` as the first element, followed by all unique elements from `arr`, `ans` is 1.**
