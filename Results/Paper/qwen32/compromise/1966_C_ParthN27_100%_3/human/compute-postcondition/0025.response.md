The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the list `s`. Since `n` is the length of the list `s` and is not modified within the loop, we only need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3 (assuming the loop has been running and `i` was incremented from 2). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

Given the conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of the list `s` where `n` > 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list with `0` as the first element, followed by all unique elements from `arr`, `i` is 4, `ans` is set to 0 if `s[i] - s[i - 1] <= 1`**
