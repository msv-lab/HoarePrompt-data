The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. 

Given that `i` is `t + 1`, the element `arr[t + 1]` is added to the set `s`. This means that the set `s` now includes all its previous elements plus `arr[t + 1]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a set containing `arr[i]` and `arr[t + 1]`, and `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2, or 1 if `n-2` is even, and 0 if `n-2` is odd, `i` is `t + 1`**.
