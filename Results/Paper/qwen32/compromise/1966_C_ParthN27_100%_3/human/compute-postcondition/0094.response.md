Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 1, the number of iterations left is `t-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been explicitly set to `1`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
