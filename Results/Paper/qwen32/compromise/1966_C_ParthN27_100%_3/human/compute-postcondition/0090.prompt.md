Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is an empty set, `ans` is 1 if `n-2` is even, or 0 if `n-2` is odd (only if `n` is greater than 2), the number of iterations left is `t-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s.add(arr[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a set containing `arr[i]`, `ans` is 1 if `n-2` is even, or 0 if `n-2` is odd (only if `n` is greater than 2), the number of iterations left is `t-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a set containing `arr[i]` and possibly other elements from `arr`, `ans` is 1 if `n-2` is even, or 0 if `n-2` is odd (only if `n` is greater than 2), the number of iterations left is `t-1`, `i` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a set containing `arr[i]` (and possibly other elements from `arr`, including `arr[4]`), `ans` is 1 if `n-2` is even, or 0 if `n-2` is odd (only if `n` is greater than 2), the number of iterations left is `t-1`, `i` is 4




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
