The `print('Alice')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'Alice'.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans`.
2. However, none of these variables are used in the given `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement directly outputs the string 'Alice'.

Thus, the output will be the string 'Alice' as it is specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **Alice**
