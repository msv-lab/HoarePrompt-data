Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, the number of iterations left is `t-1`, `i` is `i_end + 1` where `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, and `i_end + 1` must be less than `n-1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, the number of iterations left, and the condition for `i` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
