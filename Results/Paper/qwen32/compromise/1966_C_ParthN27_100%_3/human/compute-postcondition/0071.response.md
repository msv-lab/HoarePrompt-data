The code snippet provided performs a bitwise XOR operation on the variable `ans` with the integer `1`. This operation will flip the least significant bit of `ans`. Since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, we can only describe the change in terms of its effect.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, `i` is 3, `ans` has its least significant bit flipped.**
