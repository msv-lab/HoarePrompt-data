The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t` (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `t + 1` and `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a set containing `arr[i]`, and `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2, or 1 if `n-2` is even, and 0 if `n-2` is odd, `i` is `t + 1`**
