### Reasoning:

The program provided attempts to solve the problem by iterating over the array `a` from the end to the beginning, calculating the permutation `p` based on the MEX value and the current element in `a`. However, there is a logical flaw in the approach. Specifically, the program does not correctly maintain the MEX value as it constructs the permutation.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues and the correct approach:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set. When constructing the permutation `p`, the MEX value should be recalculated based on the numbers that have already been placed in `p`.

2. **Incorrect MEX Update**: The program initializes `mex` to `n` and then updates it by taking the minimum of `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`. This approach does not correctly reflect the MEX of the current set of numbers in `p`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Use a set to keep track of the numbers that have already been placed in `p`.
   - For each element in `a` from the end to the beginning, calculate the MEX of the current set of numbers in `p`.
   - Place the calculated number in `p` and update the set.
   - The MEX can be efficiently calculated by checking the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            # Find the current MEX
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used.add(p[i])
            mex = 0  # Reset mex for the next iteration
        
        print(*p)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program does not correctly maintain the MEX value, leading to incorrect results. The provided reasoning and program are incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
