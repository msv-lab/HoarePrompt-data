### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is a valid initial value because the `MEX` of an empty array is `0`, and the `MEX` of an array with all elements from `0` to `n-1` is `n`.

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - The formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]` is derived from the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, which can indeed be rearranged to `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.

3. **Updating `mex`**:
   - After calculating `p[i]`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This step ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p` (up to the current point in the reverse iteration).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

Let's validate the program's behavior using the annotated version:

- **Initialization**:
  - `mex` is set to `n` before the loop starts.

- **Reverse Iteration**:
  - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0`.
  - For each `i`, `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.
  - `mex` is then updated to `min(mex, p[i])`.

- **Output**:
  - The constructed `p` is printed.

### Correctness Validation:

Let's consider the first example provided in the problem description:

**Input**:
```
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output**:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

**Step-by-Step Execution**:
- Initialize `mex` to `5`.
- Iterate in reverse:
  - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
  - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
  - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
  - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
  - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`

The resulting `p` is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the given array `a`. The reverse iteration and the update of `mex` ensure that the constructed permutation is valid and satisfies the problem's constraints.

**Final: True**
