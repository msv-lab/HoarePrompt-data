### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the array `a` as described in the problem statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and its logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - An array `p` of length `n` is initialized with `-1` to represent the permutation that we are constructing.
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which represents the current MEX value for the permutation. Since the MEX of an empty list is `0`, and the MEX of a list containing `0, 1, ..., n-1` is `n`, this initialization makes sense.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
   - After setting `p[i]`, it updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet been used in the permutation `p`.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `p` for a test case, the program prints the elements of `p`.

### Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
- Expected output: `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

- Iteration 1 (`i = 4`): `mex = 5`, `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
- Iteration 2 (`i = 3`): `mex = 3`, `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
- Iteration 3 (`i = 2`): `mex = 2`, `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
- Iteration 4 (`i = 1`): `mex = 2`, `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
- Iteration 5 (`i = 0`): `mex = 1`, `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`

The constructed permutation `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` for each test case based on the given array `a`. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
