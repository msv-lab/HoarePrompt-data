Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for each `i` from `1` to `n`. The MEX (minimum excludant) of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided attempts to construct the permutation `p` by iterating backwards through the array `a`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - `a` is the input array.
   - `p` is initialized as an array of `-1` of length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Constructing `p`**:
   - The program iterates from `i = n-1` to `0` (i.e., backwards).
   - For each `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

### Correctness Analysis:
The approach taken by the program is flawed. The key issue is that the program calculates `p[i]` based on the `mex` value at the end of the permutation and works backwards. This does not guarantee that the MEX condition will be satisfied for each prefix of `p` as required by the problem statement.

Here's why the program is incorrect:
- The MEX value for a prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` should be considered when constructing `p[i]`. However, the program uses the overall `mex` value, which is not necessarily the MEX of the prefix.
- The MEX should be recalculated for each prefix during the forward construction of `p`. The backward construction does not naturally ensure the MEX condition is met for each prefix.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```
The correct output is `0 1 4 2 3`.

However, the program's approach would not necessarily produce this output because it does not correctly calculate the MEX for each prefix during the construction of `p`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` that satisfies the required conditions for each test case.

**Correctness: False**
