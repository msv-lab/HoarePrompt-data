To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means the loop will iterate over the variable `i` starting from `n-1` down to `0`.

Here are the key points to consider:
- The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
- The variable `i` will be initialized to `n-1` before the loop starts.
- The variables `t`, `a`, `p`, and `mex` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. However, for completeness, we can describe their states as they are given.

Given this, the necessary adjustments to ensure the loop executes are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure the range is not empty.
- `i` should be initialized to `n-1` (though this will happen automatically when the loop starts).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with all elements equal to `-1`, `mex` is `n`**
