To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means the loop will iterate from `n-1` down to `0`.

Let's analyze the state before the loop:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
- `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. This variable is part of the loop head (`range(n - 1, -1, -1)`), so it needs to be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is an integer input by the user. This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
- `p` is a list of `-1` with length `n`. This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
- `mex` is `n`. This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

From the above analysis, the only variable in the loop head that needs to be considered is `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `-1` with length `n`, `mex` is `n`**
