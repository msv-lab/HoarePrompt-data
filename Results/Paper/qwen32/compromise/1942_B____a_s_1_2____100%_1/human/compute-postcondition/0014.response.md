The code snippet `mex = min(mex, p[i])` updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `p[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` must be at least 2
- `a` is a list of `n` integers
- `p` is a list where the 1st element is `mex - a[0]` and all other elements are `-1`
- `mex` is `min(min(n, n - a[1]), min(n, n - a[1]) - a[1])`
- `i` is 0

After executing the code snippet, the new value of `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list where the 1st element is `mex - a[0]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is `min(mex, p[0])`, `i` is 0**.
