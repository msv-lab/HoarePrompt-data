Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `mex - a[i]` (where `i` is `n - 3`), the `n-2`-th element equal to `mex - a[n - 2]`, and all other elements equal to `-1` or previously calculated values, `mex` is `min(mex, p[i])`, `i` is `n - 3`**

In this output state, the value of `p[i]` (where `i` is `n - 3`) is updated to `mex - a[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
