The code snippet provided is:
```python
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

This line of code reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of these string elements to an integer, and then stores these integers in the list `a`.

Given the initial state, `a` was already defined as a list of `n` integers. After executing this line of code, `a` is reassigned to a new list of integers provided by the user input.

Since the initial state mentions that `a` is a list of `n` integers, and the code redefines `a` based on user input, we need to consider that the new `a` will be the list of integers input by the user, and `n` will be the length of this new list. The other variables (`t`, `p`, `mex`) remain unchanged unless they are affected by subsequent code, which is not provided here.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`; `n` is the length of the new list `a` input by the user; `a` is the new list of integers input by the user; `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`; `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet appeared in the list `p`.**
