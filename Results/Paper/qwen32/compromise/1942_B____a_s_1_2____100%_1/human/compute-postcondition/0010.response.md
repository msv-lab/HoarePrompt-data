The code snippet `p[i] = mex - a[i]` updates the `i`-th element of the list `p` to be the value of `mex - a[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, the first element of `p` is updated accordingly. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mex`, and the rest of the elements in `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list where the 1st element is `mex - a[1]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is `min(n, n - a[i])`, `i` is 1**.
