The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. 

Given the initial state, `n` was already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\). After executing the code, the value of `n` will be the integer provided by the user input, which still falls within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\). The value of `t` and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n.**
