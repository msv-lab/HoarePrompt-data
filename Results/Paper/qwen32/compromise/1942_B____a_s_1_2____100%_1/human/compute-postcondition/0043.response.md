Output State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `mex - a[i]` (where `i` is `n - 1`), the rest equal to `-1`, `mex` is `min(mex, p[i])`, `i` is `n - 1`**

In this output state, the value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
