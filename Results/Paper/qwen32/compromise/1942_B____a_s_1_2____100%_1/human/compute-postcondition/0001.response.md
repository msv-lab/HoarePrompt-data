The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The state of `n` and `a` are not directly relevant to whether the loop will execute, as they are used within the loop body, which is omitted.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, `t` must be at least 1**
