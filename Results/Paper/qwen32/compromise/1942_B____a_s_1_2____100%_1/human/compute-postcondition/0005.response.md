The code snippet assigns the value `n` to the variable `mex`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is an integer input by the user; `p` is a list of `-1` with length `n`; `mex` is `n`.**
