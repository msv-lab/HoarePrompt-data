test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and a list a of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. Each test case guarantees that there is at least one chip in the list a. The length of test_cases is between 1 and 1000.
