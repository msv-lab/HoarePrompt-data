Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers that does not end with 0; `res` is the total count of zeros in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `res` will hold the total number of zeros present in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
