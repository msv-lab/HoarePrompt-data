The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the last element of `a` is 0, this element will be removed. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `pop` operation on the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 999; `n` is the integer value of the input; `a` is a list that contains at least one element and the last element of `a` is not 0 (since the 0 has been removed); `res` is 0**.
