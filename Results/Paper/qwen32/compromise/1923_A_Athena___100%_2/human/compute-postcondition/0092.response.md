Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of cells and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each integer is either 0 (indicating a free cell) or 1 (indicating a cell containing a chip). The function returns the number of chips for each test case.**
