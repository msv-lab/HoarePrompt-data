The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`. Since the loop iterates over the indices of the list `a`, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the next index to be processed. The list `a` does not need to be adjusted as the loop body does not modify it directly.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than the length of `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 999; `n` is the integer value of the input; `a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 1 element; `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is set to 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
