The code snippet `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Given that `a` starts with `0`, the first element `0` will be removed. Therefore, the list `a` will no longer contain this initial `0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty list with the first element removed, e.g., if `a` was `[0, 1, 2]`, it is now `[1, 2]`; `res` is 0.**
