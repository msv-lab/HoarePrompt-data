The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Given that the initial state specifies that the first element of `a` is always `0`, after executing this line, the first element `0` will be removed from the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999, `n` is the integer value of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with the first element removed (originally `[0, ...]` so now `[...]`), `res` is 0.**
