The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Given that `a` starts with `0`, after executing this line, the first element `0` will be removed, and `a` will be updated to the remaining elements of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty list that does not start with `0` (e.g., if `a` was `[0, 1, 2]`, it is now `[1, 2]`); `res` is 0.**
