The code snippet provided sets `cnt` to 0. This change affects the variable `cnt` but does not impact the values of other variables such as `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`, or `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `i` is 2; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`; `cnt` is 0.**
