The code snippet provided sets the variable `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
