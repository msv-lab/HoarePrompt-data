The code snippet `cnt = 0` sets the value of `cnt` to 0. The other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt` if `ans` was `n`; otherwise, `ans` is 0; `t` remains 2; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**
