Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`. If the current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
