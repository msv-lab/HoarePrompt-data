The given initial state describes the conditions under which the variable `ans` is updated and the value of `n`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print(-1)`, which means it will print the integer `-1` regardless of the values of `ans` or `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `ans` variable is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
2. The value of `n` is either 1 or `ans` equals `n`.

However, these conditions do not influence the `print` statement because the statement is hardcoded to print `-1`.

Output: **-1**
