The given code snippet contains a `print(-1)` statement. The initial state provided does not indicate any conditions or changes that would affect the execution of this `print` statement. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` are described, but none of these variables are used in the `print(-1)` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be `-1` as specified by the `print` statement.

Output: **-1**
