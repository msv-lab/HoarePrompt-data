The code snippet `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables. 

Given the initial state, the only change is that `cnt` is now 0. All other variables retain their previous values and constraints.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input minus 1, 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
