The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `cnt` was either 0, 1, or 2. After incrementing, `cnt` will be 1, 2, or 3 respectively. 

Since the increment operation does not affect the values of `ans`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, or `i`, these variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`ans` is `n` if `a[i]` equals `tmp` and `cnt` is either 1 or 2; otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt` if `ans` was `n` before, or `ans` is 0; `t` remains 2; `n` is an input integer greater than `i + 1`; `a` is a list of integers; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 1, 2, or 3; `i` is `i + 1`.**
