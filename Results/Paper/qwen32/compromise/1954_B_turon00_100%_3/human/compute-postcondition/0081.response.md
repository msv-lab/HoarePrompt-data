Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt` if `ans` was `n` before, or `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` if `ans` was not `n` before; `t` remains 2, `n` is an input integer greater than `i + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0 if `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`, or 1 or 2 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
