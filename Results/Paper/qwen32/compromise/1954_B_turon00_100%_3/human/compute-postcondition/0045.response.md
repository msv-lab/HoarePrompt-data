The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `cnt` was either 1 or 0. After the increment, `cnt` will be 2 if it was initially 1, or `cnt` will be 1 if it was initially 0.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input minus 1, where 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`. If the current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 if it was 1, or `cnt` is 1 if it was 0, and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`; `i` is `t + 1`.**
