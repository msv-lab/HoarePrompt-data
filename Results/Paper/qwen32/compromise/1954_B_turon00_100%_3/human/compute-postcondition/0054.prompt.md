Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value provided by the input minus 1, 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is `n`. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == tmp:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer value provided by the input minus 1, where 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`. If the current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the integer value provided by the input minus 1, where 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 if it was 1, or `cnt` is 1 if it was 0, and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`; `i` is `t + 1`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is set to 0 and `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the integer value provided by the input minus 1, where 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`. If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `cnt` becomes 3 if it was 2, 2 if it was 1, or 1 if it was 0), and `ans` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is set to 0 and `ans` is set to the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`; `i` is `t + 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
