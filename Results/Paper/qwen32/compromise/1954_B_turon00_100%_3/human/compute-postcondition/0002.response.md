The code assigns the value of the next input to the variable `n`, converting it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer provided by the input, and it remains unchanged. Therefore, after the code execution, `n` holds the integer value of the second input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is the integer value provided by the second input.**
