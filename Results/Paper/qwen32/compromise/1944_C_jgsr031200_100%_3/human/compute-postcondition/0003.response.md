The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cou` to 0. This action does not affect the values of `arr` or `freq`. The initial conditions for `arr` and `freq` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, and the length of `arr` is `n`, with 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `freq` is a list where the i-th element represents the number of times the integer `i-1` appears in `arr`; `cou` is 0.**
