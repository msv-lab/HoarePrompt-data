### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the provided code does not correctly implement the logic for determining the final score of the game based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. It claims that the code does not account for the alternating turns of Alice and Bob and their respective strategies to maximize or minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.

However, upon closer inspection, the provided code actually does implement the correct logic to determine the MEX of the final array `c` after both players play optimally. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Frequency Counting**:
   - The code first counts the frequency of each number in the array `arr` using a frequency list `freq` of size `n+1`.
   - This is crucial because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `c`.

2. **Determining the MEX**:
   - The code then iterates through the frequency list `freq` to find the smallest index `i` where `freq[i]` is `0` or the second index `i` where `freq[i]` is `1`.
   - This is because if there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once, the MEX will be the smaller of these two numbers. If all numbers appear at least twice, the MEX will be the smallest number that does not appear at all.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The key insight here is that the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob can be summarized by the frequency of the numbers in the array. Alice will always try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it. However, the final MEX can be directly determined from the frequency counts without simulating each turn.
   - If a number appears exactly once, it means that one player (Alice or Bob) will end up choosing it, and it will be included in the final array `c`. If a number appears twice, it will be chosen by both players, and it will not affect the MEX. If a number does not appear at all, it will be the MEX.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases correctly. For example, if all numbers appear an even number of times, the MEX will be the smallest number that does not appear at all. If the array contains only one unique number, the MEX will be `1` if the number appears exactly once, and `0` if it appears more than once.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the final score of the game based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. It correctly counts the frequency of each number and determines the MEX based on these counts. Therefore, the original assessment that the code is incorrect is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
