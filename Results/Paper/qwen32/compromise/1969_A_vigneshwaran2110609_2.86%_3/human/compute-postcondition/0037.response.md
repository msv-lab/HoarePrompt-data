The `print(2)` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The `print` function will output the integer value `2` as specified.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `x`, `l`, `i`, `flag`), but none of these variables are used in the `print(2)` statement.
2. The `print(2)` statement explicitly outputs the integer `2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(2)` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
