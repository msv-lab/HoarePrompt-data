Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `string` is the newly input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` and must have at least 1 character.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1.
- `x` is the first character of `s` (`s[0]`).
- `j` is an index such that `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `done` is a boolean that is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise False.
- `count` is greater than 1.
- `count2` is equal to `count`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **`string[:j - 1]`**:
   - This slice takes all characters from the start of the string up to (but not including) the character at index `j - 1`.
   - If `j` is 1, `j - 1` would be 0, and `string[:0]` would be an empty string `''`.
   - If `j` is greater than 1, `string[:j - 1]` would be the substring from the start of `string` up to the character just before the character at index `j`.

2. **`string[j - 1:]`**:
   - This slice takes all characters from index `j - 1` to the end of the string.
   - If `j` is 1, `j - 1` would be 0, and `string[0:]` would be the entire `string`.
   - If `j` is greater than 1, `string[j - 1:]` would be the substring starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

### Example Scenarios:
- **If `j` is 1**:
  - `string[:j - 1]` is `string[:0]` which is `''`.
  - `string[j - 1:]` is `string[0:]` which is the entire `string`.
  - Output: **'' [entire string]**

- **If `j` is 2**:
  - `string[:j - 1]` is `string[:1]` which is the first character of `string`.
  - `string[j - 1:]` is `string[1:]` which is the substring from the second character to the end.
  - Output: **[first character] [substring from second character to end]**

### General Case:
- For a general `j`, the output will be the substring from the start of `string` up to (but not including) the character at index `j - 1`, and the substring from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

### Final Output:
Based on the above analysis, the print statement will output two substrings as described.

Output: **string[:j - 1] string[j - 1:] (where string[:j - 1] is the substring from the start of string up to (but not including) the character at index j - 1, and string[j - 1:] is the substring from the character at index j - 1 to the end of string)**
