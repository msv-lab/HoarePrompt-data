Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other conditions about the test cases and strings remain unchanged.
