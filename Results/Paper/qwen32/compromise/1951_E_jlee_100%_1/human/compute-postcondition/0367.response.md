Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 0; `count` is greater than or equal to 0; `count2` is greater than or equal to 0. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` is set to True and if `count2` is less than `count`, the loop breaks; if `count2` equals `count`, `count` is set to 1 if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is set to 0; if `count2` is greater than `count`, `count2` remains greater than `count`; if `s[j]` equals `x`, `count2` is set to 1. If `count` is 0, `done` remains False and `count2` remains unchanged.**
