The `print(1)` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The `print` function will simply output the integer `1`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Description**: 
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - The count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, meaning there is exactly one character in `s` that is not `x`.
   - Additional conditions about `done` and the middle character of `s` are provided, but they do not affect the `print(1)` statement.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print(1)` statement is executed regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

3. **Output**:
   - The output of the `print(1)` statement is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
