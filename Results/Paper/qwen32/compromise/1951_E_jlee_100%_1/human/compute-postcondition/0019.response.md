Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`. The count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n`, meaning all characters in `s` are the same. If `x` is not equal to `s[-1]`, the state of `done` is not specified unless `n` is equal to 1, in which case `done` remains False. If `x` is equal to `s[-1]`, there is no change to the state of `done`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables. The loop or conditional structure that the `continue` statement is part of would move to the next iteration or condition, but since no changes are made to the variables in the provided code snippet, the state remains the same.
