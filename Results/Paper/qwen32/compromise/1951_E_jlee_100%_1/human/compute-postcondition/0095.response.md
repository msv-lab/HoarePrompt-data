Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is initialized to 0.
3. `string` is the input string.
4. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
6. `x` is the first element of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`).
7. `j` is initialized to 0 and then incremented by 1.
8. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True.
9. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains only a `print('YES')` statement. This means that regardless of the conditions and variables described in the initial state, the output will always be 'YES'.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
