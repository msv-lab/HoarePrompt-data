Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`; `done` is True.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that the variable `done` is set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values.
