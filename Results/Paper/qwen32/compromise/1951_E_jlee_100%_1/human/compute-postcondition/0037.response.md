To determine what will be printed by the `print(1)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which the print statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`i`**: An integer initialized to 0.
3. **`string`**: The input string.
4. **`s`**: A list of characters from `string`.
5. **`n`**: The length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
6. **`x`**: The first element of `s` (`s[0]`).
7. **`done`**: The state of `done` is not explicitly specified in all cases, but certain conditions are given:
   - If all characters in `s` are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), the state of `done` is not specified unless `n` is equal to 1, in which case `done` remains False.
   - If not all characters in `s` are the same (`s.count(x) != n`), and there is exactly one character in `s` that is not `x` (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), then if `n` is odd and the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` of `s` is not `x`, the state of `done` is not specified unless `n` is equal to 1, in which case `done` remains False.
   - If `x` is equal to `s[-1]`, there is no change to the state of `done`.
   - Additionally, either `n` is even, or `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is equal to `x`.
8. **`count`**: An integer initialized to 0.
9. **`count2`**: An integer initialized to 0.
10. **`s[j]`**: Not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.

### Analysis:
The print statement is `print(1)`, which means it will always print the integer `1` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, or the conditions provided.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will execute and print the integer `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
