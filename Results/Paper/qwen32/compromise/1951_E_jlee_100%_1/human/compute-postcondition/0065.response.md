Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`. If `count` is greater than 1, `count` indicates that there are at least two characters in `s` that are different from `x`, `done` is True, and `count2` equals `count`. If `count` is equal to 1, `count` indicates that there is exactly one character in `s` that is different from `x`, `done` may be True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` within the loop; otherwise, `done` remains unchanged, and `count2` is 0.**
