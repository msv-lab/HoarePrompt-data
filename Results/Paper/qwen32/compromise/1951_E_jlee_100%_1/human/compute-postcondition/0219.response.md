Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is less than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count` was equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0. If `count` was greater than 1, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
