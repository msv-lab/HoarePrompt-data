Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `j + 1`; `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
