To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the logic described.

### Initial State and Logic Analysis:

1. **Variables and their Definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `i`: An integer initialized to 1.
   - `string`: A newly input string.
   - `s`: A list of characters from the `string`, with at least 1 character.
   - `n`: The length of `s`, which is at least 1.
   - `x`: The first element of `s`, i.e., `s[0]`.
   - `count` and `count2`: These variables are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but their behavior is described.
   - `done`: A boolean variable that is set to `True` under certain conditions.

2. **Logic Described:**
   - If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is incremented by 1.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - If `count` is equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0.
   - If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `s[j]` remains `x`.
   - If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count2` or `done`.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to `j`.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.

3. **Key Points:**
   - The logic involves iterating over the string `s` and comparing characters from the start and end towards the center.
   - The `done` flag indicates whether certain conditions are met that would terminate the loop or if statement.
   - The `count` and `count2` variables seem to track certain conditions related to the characters in the string.
   - The `print('YES')` statement is outside of any conditional blocks, meaning it will execute regardless of the conditions inside the loop or if statements.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print('YES')` statement is not inside any conditional block and is guaranteed to execute, it will always print `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
