Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `n`; `count` and `count2` are set based on the loop conditions; `done` is False; and the condition `not done` is true. Since the else part is not present, there are no additional changes if `done` were to be true.**
