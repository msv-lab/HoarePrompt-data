Let's break down the given initial state and analyze the provided `print` statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. **`i`**: Initialized to 0.
3. **`string`**: The input string.
4. **`s`**: A list of characters from `string`.
5. **`n`**: The length of `s`.
6. **`x`**: The first element of `s` (`s[0]`).
7. **Count of `x` in `s`**: `n - 1`, meaning there is exactly one character in `s` that is not `x`.
8. **Condition on `x` and `s[-1]`**: If `x` is not equal to `s[-1]`, the state of `done` is not specified unless `n` is equal to 1, in which case `done` remains `False`. If `x` is equal to `s[-1]`, there is no change to the state of `done`.
9. **Additional Condition**: Either `n` is even, or `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is equal to `x`.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
