Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases.
- `i`: An integer initialized to 0.
- `string`: The input string.
- `s`: A list of characters from `string`.
- `n`: The length of `s`, which is greater than 0.
- `x`: The first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`).
- `count`: An integer greater than 0, indicating the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `x`.
- `s[j]`: A character in `s` that is not equal to `x`.
- `done`: A boolean that may be set to `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` within a loop.
- `count2`: An integer less than `count`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`string[:j]`**: This slice of the string includes all characters from the start of the string up to, but not including, the character at index `j`.
2. **`string[j:]`**: This slice of the string includes all characters from the character at index `j` to the end of the string.

Given the initial state, `j` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `x` (the first character of `s`). Therefore, `string[:j]` will be the substring containing all characters up to the first character that differs from `x`, and `string[j:]` will be the substring starting from the first differing character to the end of the string.

### Output:
The print statement will output two substrings:
- The first substring is everything from the start of the string up to (but not including) the first character that differs from `x`.
- The second substring is everything from the first differing character to the end of the string.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **string[:j] string[j:] (where string[:j] is the substring from the start of the string up to the first character that differs from x, and string[j:] is the substring from the first differing character to the end of the string)**
