Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is greater than 4; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 4; `count2` is greater than or equal to 0; `count` is 4. If `count2` > `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, and `count2` remain unchanged.**
