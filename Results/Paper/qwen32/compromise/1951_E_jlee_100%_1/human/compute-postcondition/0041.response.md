Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`. If all characters in `s` are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), then the state of `done` is not specified unless `n` is equal to 1, in which case `done` remains False. If not all characters in `s` are the same (`s.count(x) != n`), and there is exactly one character in `s` that is not `x` (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), then if `n` is odd and the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` of `s` is not `x`, the state of `done` is not specified unless `n` is equal to 1, in which case `done` remains False. If `x` is equal to `s[-1]`, there is no change to the state of `done`. Additionally, either `n` is even, or `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is equal to `x`. If `s.count(x) != n - 1`, the state of `done` remains unchanged; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
