The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the loop will iterate over the range of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The state of `t` is already provided as an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
