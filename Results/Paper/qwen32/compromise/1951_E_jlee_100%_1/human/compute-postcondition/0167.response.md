Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`; `done` is False; `count` and `count2` are the values after the last iteration. If `n` is equal to 1, the program maintains the same state as described. If `x` is not equal to `s[-1]`, the program maintains the same state as described. Otherwise, the program maintains the same state as described.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no other operations in the provided code snippet, all the variables retain their initial values.
