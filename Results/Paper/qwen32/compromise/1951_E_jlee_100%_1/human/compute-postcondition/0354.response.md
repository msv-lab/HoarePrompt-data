Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 0; `count` is greater than 0; `count2` is 0; `done` remains False; the current character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`; `count2` is not less than `count`; `count2` is not equal to `count`**
