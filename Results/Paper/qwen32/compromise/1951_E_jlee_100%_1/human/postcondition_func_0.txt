The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines whether it is possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that the resulting parts are not palindromes and prints 'YES' along with the split positions if possible, otherwise prints 'NO'.
