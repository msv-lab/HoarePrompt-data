### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine if it is possible to sort an array by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its individual digits. The core logic of the program is based on the function `func_1`, which checks if the list is already sorted. The main loop iterates over the elements of the list and applies the splitting operation when necessary.

However, there are several issues with the provided code that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The main loop that iterates over the list elements (`for p in range(1, len(list1)):`) does not correctly handle the splitting operation. The condition `if not func_1(list1):` is checked before every iteration, but it is not correctly placed to ensure that the entire list is checked and modified as needed. The loop should continue until no more splits are needed or until the list is sorted.

2. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The splitting logic (`a = list1[p - 1]`, `list1.pop(p - 1)`, `list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)`, `list1.insert(p, a % 10)`) is flawed. It only handles two-digit numbers and incorrectly inserts the digits. For example, if the number is 123, it should be split into 1, 2, and 3, but the current logic only handles numbers up to 99 and incorrectly splits them into two digits.

3. **Function Call Placement**: The function `func_1` is called before every iteration of the loop, which is inefficient. It should be called after the list has been modified to check if the list is sorted.

4. **Handling of Single-Digit Numbers**: The code does not handle the case where a number is already a single digit correctly. It should not attempt to split single-digit numbers.

5. **Case Sensitivity**: The output should be case-insensitive, but the code prints 'Yes' and 'No' which is correct, but it should be ensured that other variations are also handled if needed.

### Correctness:

Given these issues, the program is incorrect as it does not correctly implement the logic to split numbers and check if the list can be sorted.

**Correctness: False**
