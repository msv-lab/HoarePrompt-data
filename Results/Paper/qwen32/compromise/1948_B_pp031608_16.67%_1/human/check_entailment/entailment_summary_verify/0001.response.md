### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, provided code, and function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case independently.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
- It then iterates through the array and checks if the array is sorted using `func_1`.
- If the array is not sorted, it checks if the current element is greater than the previous one and greater than 10. If so, it splits the previous element into its digits and re-inserts them into the array.
- After attempting to sort the array, it checks again if the array is sorted using `func_1` and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Flawed Splitting Logic**:
   - The program only attempts to split the previous element if it is greater than the current element and greater than 10. This is insufficient because it fails to consider cases where multiple splits might be needed or where the current element is less than the previous one.
   - The program only performs a single pass through the array and does not handle scenarios where repeated splits are necessary to achieve a sorted order.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Multiple Splits**:
   - The program does not re-check the entire array after each split operation to ensure that further splits might be needed.
   - It only considers the immediate neighbors, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted through any number of splits.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted, but it is not used effectively in the main logic. The main logic does not ensure that all necessary splits are performed before checking if the array is sorted.

#### Correctness:
Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted through the described operations. It fails to handle all possible scenarios and does not guarantee that the array will be checked in a way that considers all possible splits.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for splitting elements and the inadequate handling of multiple splits.

**Final: False**
