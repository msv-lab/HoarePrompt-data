### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts under promotion.

However, there are several issues in the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases as `n`, but then it uses `n` as the number of yogurts for the first test case. This will lead to incorrect processing of the input.
2. **Incorrect Variable Names**: The code reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case, but the problem description specifies `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `c` is not defined in the problem statement.
3. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, but `c` is not defined. It should be calculating the cost based on `a` and `b`.
4. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for determining the minimum cost is incorrect. The program should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price versus the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):  # Iterate over each test case
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())  # Read n, a, and b for each test case
        
        # Calculate the cost if buying yogurts in pairs
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        
        # Cost for pairs and remaining yogurts
        cost_pairs = pairs * b
        cost_remaining = remaining * a
        
        # Total cost
        total_cost = cost_pairs + cost_remaining
        
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
