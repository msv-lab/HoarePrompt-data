Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Let's break it down:

1. **Input Parsing**: The first integer read from the input is `t`, the number of test cases. However, the program immediately reads `n` as an integer, which is incorrect because `n` is part of the input for each test case, not the first input.

2. **Variable Naming and Logic**: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are read from the input, but `c` is used in the logic instead of `b` for the price of two yogurts. This is a mistake because `b` is the correct variable for the price of two yogurts.

3. **Calculation Logic**: The logic to determine the minimum cost is flawed. The program calculates `d = c / 2`, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Instead, it should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually versus in pairs using the promotion.

4. **Comparison and Output**: The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The correct comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually (`n * a`) and the cost of buying them in pairs using the promotion (`(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts individually
        cost_individual = n * a
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion
        cost_promotion = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Print the minimum cost
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_promotion))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Correctness: **False**
