You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it calculates and prints either `a * b` or `a * (c / 2)`, rounded to the nearest integer, depending on which value is smaller.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given promotion. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

The code reads the number of test cases (`n`) and then for each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (`a`), the price for one yogurt (`b`), and the price for two yogurts (`c`). However, the logic to calculate the minimum cost is incorrect.

Here's the problematic logic:
```python
d = c / 2
if a * b < a * d:
    print(a * b)
else:
    print(round(a * d))
```
The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is not used correctly in the logic. The intention seems to be to compare whether buying individual yogurts or buying them in pairs is cheaper.

The correct approach should be:
1. Calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought (`n // 2`).
2. Calculate the cost for these pairs (`(n // 2) * c`).
3. Calculate the cost for the remaining yogurt, if any (`(n % 2) * b`).
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total minimum cost.

Let's consider a test case where the program would fail:
- Input: `1 3 5 11`
- Expected Output: `15`
- Program Output: `15` (which is correct in this specific case, but let's consider another case)

Another test case:
- Input: `1 4 5 11`
- Expected Output: `20`
- Program Output: `10` (which is incorrect)

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        total_cost = (pairs * b) + (remaining * a)
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly by considering the number of pairs and the remaining yogurts separately.
