The code snippet increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial state specifies that `cnt` can be either 0 or 1 based on the condition involving `a` and `b`. After the increment, if `cnt` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `cnt` was 1, it becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers, `b` is the newly input list of integers, if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `i` is 0 and `cnt` is 2, otherwise, `i` is 1 and `cnt` is 1, `j` is 1**
