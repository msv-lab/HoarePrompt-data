Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
