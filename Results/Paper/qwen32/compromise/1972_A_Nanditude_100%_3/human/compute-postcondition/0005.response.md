The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. It does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input; `cnt` is 0.**
