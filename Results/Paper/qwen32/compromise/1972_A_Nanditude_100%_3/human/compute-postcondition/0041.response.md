The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cnt` depends on the condition `if b[j] is less than a[i]`. If true, `cnt` is initially 2 and becomes 3. If false, `cnt` is initially 0 and becomes 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers, `b` is the newly input list of integers, `j` is 2. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `i` is 0 and `cnt` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `cnt` is 1.**
