Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the number of problems, a list `a` of length `n` representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and a list `b` of length `n` representing the expected difficulties of the problems. For each test case, the function evaluates whether the proposed difficulties match the expected difficulties and returns a result indicating whether the proposed difficulties are correct or not.**
