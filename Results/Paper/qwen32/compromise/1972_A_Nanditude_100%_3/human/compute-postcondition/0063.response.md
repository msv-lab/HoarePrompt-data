The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. However, `cnt` was not mentioned in the initial state, so we can infer that `cnt` must have been initialized to 0 before this line of code was executed. After the execution of `cnt += 1`, `cnt` becomes 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are newly input lists of integers, `j` is 0, `cnt` is 1**.
