The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was either 0 or 1, after the increment, `i` will be 1 or 2 respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `j`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The condition for `cnt` and `i` based on the comparison between `b[j]` and `a[i]` before the increment is still valid but now `i` has been updated.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are newly input lists of integers, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `cnt` is either 0 or 1. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i-1]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` was 0 before incrementing, otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` was 1 before incrementing.**
