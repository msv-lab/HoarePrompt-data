The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0. This change affects the variable `cnt` while the values of other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the newly input list of integers, `b` is the newly input list of integers, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is the count of elements in `b` that are not less than the corresponding elements in `a`, `cnt` is 0.**
