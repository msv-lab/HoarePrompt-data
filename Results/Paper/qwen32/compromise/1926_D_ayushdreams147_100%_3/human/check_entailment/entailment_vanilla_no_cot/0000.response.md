Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. The goal is to determine the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits.

The current implementation uses a bitmask operation `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` which is supposed to invert the 31 least significant bits of `num`. However, the logic for counting and grouping numbers is incorrect. The provided code does not correctly track the groups based on the bit conditions described.

A correct approach would involve using a data structure to track which numbers can be placed in the same group based on their bit patterns. One possible solution is to use a set to track the bit patterns that have already been used in a group.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    bit_patterns = set()
    for num in a:
        # Get the 31 least significant bits
        pattern = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)
        if pattern in bit_patterns:
            # If the pattern is already in the set, we need a new group
            bit_patterns = {pattern}
        else:
            # Otherwise, add the pattern to the current group
            bit_patterns.add(pattern)
    # The number of groups is the size of the set
    return len(bit_patterns)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))
```

In the corrected version, for each number, we extract the 31 least significant bits and check if this pattern has already been used in any group. If it has, we start a new group. If not, we add the pattern to the current group. The number of groups is then the size of the set `bit_patterns`.
