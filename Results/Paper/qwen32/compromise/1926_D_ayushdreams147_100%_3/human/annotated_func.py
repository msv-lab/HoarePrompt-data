#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique elements that do not have a corresponding bitwise complement in the list `a`, `count` is an empty dictionary.

    #The program returns the number of unique elements that do not have a corresponding bitwise complement in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns the count of unique elements in the list `a` that do not have a corresponding bitwise complement (i.e., a number `x` such that `x ^ y = 2^31 - 1`) present in the list.
