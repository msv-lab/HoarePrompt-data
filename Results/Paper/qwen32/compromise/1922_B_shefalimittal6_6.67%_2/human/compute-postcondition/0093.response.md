To solve this, we need to consider the possible values of `cnt` and how they affect `res` and `total_sum`.

Given the conditions:
- If `cnt` is `0`, `1`, `2`, or `>= 3`, `total_sum` is `1` except when `cnt` is `1`, in which case `total_sum` is `0`.
- If `cnt` is `>= 3`, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
- Otherwise, `res` is not defined (but in this context, since we are adding to it, we can assume it starts at `0`).

The equation to consider is:
```
res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
```

Let's break down the possible cases for `cnt`:

1. **If `cnt` is `0`:**
   - `total_sum` is `1`.
   - `res` is not defined, so we assume it's `0`.
   - `res += math.comb(0, 2) * 1` → `res += 0 * 1` → `res = 0`.

2. **If `cnt` is `1`:**
   - `total_sum` is `0`.
   - `res` is not defined, so we assume it's `0`.
   - `res += math.comb(1, 2) * 0` → `res += 0 * 0` → `res = 0`.

3. **If `cnt` is `2`:**
   - `total_sum` is `1`.
   - `res` is not defined, so we assume it's `0`.
   - `res += math.comb(2, 2) * 1` → `res += 1 * 1` → `res = 1`.

4. **If `cnt` is `>= 3`:**
   - `total_sum` is `1`.
   - `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - `res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * 1` → `res = math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2)`.

Given the initial state does not specify `cnt`, we consider the general form of the result based on the above conditions.

Output State: **`t` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`, `nums` is `[5]`. If `cnt` is `0`, `1`, or `2`, `res` is `0`, `1`, or `0` respectively. If `cnt` is `>= 3`, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2)`.**
