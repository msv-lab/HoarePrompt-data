Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints a result based on the frequency of each integer in the list, specifically the number of ways to choose three identical numbers and the number of ways to choose two identical numbers multiplied by the sum of counts of all different numbers.**
