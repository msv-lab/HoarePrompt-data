Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `nums` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; the loop has finished iterating through all elements in `nums`; `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; if `cnt` is equal to 2, `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; otherwise, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to its old value plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is also increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
