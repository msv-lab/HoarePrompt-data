Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `nums` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; the loop has finished iterating through all elements in `nums`; `res` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and states as described.
