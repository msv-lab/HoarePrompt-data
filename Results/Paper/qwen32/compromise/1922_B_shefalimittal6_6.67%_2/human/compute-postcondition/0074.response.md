The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1` updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by incrementing the count of the key `x` by 1. If `x` is not already a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added with a count of 1.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `nums`, and `res` are not directly affected by this line of code. The only change is in the `num_of_lens` dictionary.

Output State: **`t` is `len(nums) - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is updated such that the count of `x` is incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is updated to the accumulated sum based on the counts in `num_of_lens`**.

In simpler terms, the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
