To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State Recap**:
    - `t`: The length of the input list `nums`.
    - `n`: The input integer (not used in the provided loop).
    - `num_of_lens`: A dictionary where keys are unique integers from `nums` and values are their respective counts incremented by 1.
    - `nums`: A list of integers.
    - `res`: Initialized to 0. This variable accumulates results based on the counts of integers in `num_of_lens`.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
    - The loop iterates over each value `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`.
    - If `cnt >= 3`, it adds `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to `res`.
    - If `cnt >= 2`, it calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt` and adds `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to `res`.

3. **Final Output State**:
    - After the loop completes, `res` will contain the sum of:
        - `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each count `cnt` that is 3 or greater.
        - `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each count `cnt` that is 2 or greater, where `total_sum` is the sum of all other counts in `num_of_lens`.

Given this understanding, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`t` remains the length of `nums`, `n` remains unchanged, `num_of_lens` remains the dictionary of counts, `nums` remains the input list, and `res` is updated to the accumulated sum based on the counts in `num_of_lens`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has processed all the counts of unique integers in `nums`, `res` will hold the final accumulated value based on the combinatorial calculations, while `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `nums` will remain in their initial states.
