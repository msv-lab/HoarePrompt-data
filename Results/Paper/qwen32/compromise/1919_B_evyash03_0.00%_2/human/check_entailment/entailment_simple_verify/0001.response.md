### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given a string `s` consisting of `+` and `-`.
- We convert `s` to an array `a` where `+` maps to `1` and `-` maps to `-1`.
- We need to split `a` into subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that their concatenation equals `a`.
- The penalty for a subarray `c` is `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.
- We need to minimize the total penalty `sum(p(b_i))`.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Splitting the String:**
   - The program splits the string `s` by the character `'-'` and calculates the sum of the lengths of the resulting parts. This step is not related to the optimal splitting strategy for minimizing the penalty.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates a count by iterating through the string `s` and adjusting a balance counter based on whether the character is `'+'` or `'-'`.
   - If the balance becomes negative, it increments a count and resets the balance.
   - Finally, it returns the count plus one if the balance is positive at the end.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` increments `count` whenever the balance goes negative and resets the balance.
- After the loop, the function returns `count + (balance > 0)`, which means it adds one more if the balance is positive at the end.

#### Evaluation:
- **Incorrect Splitting Strategy:** The program's approach of splitting by `'-'` and summing lengths is unrelated to finding the optimal splits for minimizing penalties. This step does not contribute to solving the problem as intended.
- **Incorrect Penalty Calculation:** The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. Instead, it counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds one if the balance is positive at the end. This logic does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem optimally, a correct strategy would involve:
- Using dynamic programming to find the optimal splits.
- Considering all possible splits and calculating the penalties for each.
- Choosing the splits that minimize the total penalty.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It uses an incorrect strategy for splitting the array and calculating the penalty.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
Final: **False**
