Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b1, b2, ..., bk` such that their concatenation equals the original array `a`.**
2. **Calculate the penalty for each subarray `bi` as `|sum(bi)| * len(bi)`.**
3. **Find the minimum possible total penalty.**

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by splitting the string `s` based on the character `'-'` and then calculating the result length. However, this approach is incorrect and does not consider the optimal way to split the string to minimize the penalty.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program splits the string `s` by `'-'`, which does not ensure that the sum of the subarrays is minimized. The optimal split depends on the balance between `'+'` and `'-'` characters, not just the occurrence of `'-'`.
2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the penalty incorrectly. It only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end. This does not reflect the actual penalty calculation as described in the problem statement.
3. **Lack of Optimal Splitting Strategy**: The program does not implement an optimal strategy to split the string to minimize the total penalty. It should consider all possible splits and calculate the penalties accordingly.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
10
--+++++++-
```
The optimal split would be:
- `b1 = [-1, -1]` with penalty `|sum(b1)| * len(b1) = 2 * 2 = 4`
- `b2 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with penalty `|sum(b2)| * len(b2) = 7 * 7 = 0`
- `b3 = [-1]` with penalty `|sum(b3)| * len(b3) = 1 * 1 = 1`
- `b4 = [1, 1]` with penalty `|sum(b4)| * len(b4) = 2 * 2 = 0`

The total penalty would be `4 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5`, but the provided program does not yield this result.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not implement an optimal strategy for splitting the string and calculating the penalties. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
