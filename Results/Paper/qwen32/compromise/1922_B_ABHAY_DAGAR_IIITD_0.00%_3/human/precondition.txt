test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents for the lengths of the sticks, which are 2^{a_i}. The total number of sticks across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
