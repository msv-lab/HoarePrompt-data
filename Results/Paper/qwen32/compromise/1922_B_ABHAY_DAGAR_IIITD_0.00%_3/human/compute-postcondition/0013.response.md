The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Since `x` is the second element in `num_list`, the dictionary `num_of_lens` now has `x` as a key with a value of `1`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `num_list`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1, where `x` is the second element in `num_list`.**
