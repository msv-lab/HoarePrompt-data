The code appends the value of `res` to the `results` list. The values of `res`, `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, and `total_count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a list with the final `res` appended to it; `res` is the accumulated sum of all combinations calculated in the loop; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is unchanged; `num_list` is unchanged; `num_of_lens` is unchanged; `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.**
