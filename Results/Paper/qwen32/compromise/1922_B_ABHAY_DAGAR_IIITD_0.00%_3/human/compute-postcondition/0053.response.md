Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and `1` as its value, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, and `x` is in `num_of_lens` with a count of 1.**

In natural language: The variable `num_of_lens` now includes the key `x` with a value of 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
