The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `num_list`. If `num_list` has more than one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` held the value of the last element processed in `num_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be the next element in `num_list`.

Given that `num_list` must have at least 2 elements and the previous iteration processed the first element, the next iteration should process the second element.

State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, `res` holds its original value, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary, `x` is the second element in `num_list`**
