To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`
   - `results` is a list containing the value of `res` (which is 0 initially)
   - `n` is the input integer
   - `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`
   - `res` is 0
   - `total_count` is 0

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens` (which are the counts of each unique integer in `num_list`).
   - For each `cnt` (count of a unique integer in `num_list`):
     - If `cnt >= 3`, it adds `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to `res`.
     - If `cnt >= 2`, it adds `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to `res`.
     - It then increments `total_count` by `cnt`.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - After the loop completes, `test_cases` remains `test_cases - 1` (unchanged from the initial state).
   - `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`.
   - `n`, `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged.
   - `res` is the final computed value after all iterations.
   - `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.

Let's formalize this:

- **Output State:** `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`, `res` is the final computed value, and `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.

**Output State:** **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`, `res` is the final computed value, and `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
