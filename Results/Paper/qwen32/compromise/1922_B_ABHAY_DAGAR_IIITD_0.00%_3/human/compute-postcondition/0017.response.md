The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. The value of `x` is the third element in the list `num_list`. This means that after executing the code, the dictionary `num_of_lens` will have an entry where the key is the third element of `num_list` and the value is `1`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` (the third element in `num_list`) having the value `1`, `x` is the third element in `num_list`.**
