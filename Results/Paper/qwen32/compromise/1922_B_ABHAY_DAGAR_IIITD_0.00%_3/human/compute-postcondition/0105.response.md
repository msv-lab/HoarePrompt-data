Postcondition: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, `res` holds its original value, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `num_list`. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, the value of `x` in `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.**
