The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the count of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. This means that if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is increased by 1. If `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, this line would raise a `KeyError`. However, based on the initial state provided, we can assume that `x` is a valid key in `num_of_lens` since it is described as "the next element in `num_list`" and the dictionary `num_of_lens` is updated to include counts of elements from `num_list`.

Given this, the value associated with the key `x` in `num_of_lens` will be incremented by 1. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains `x` as a key with its count incremented by 1, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, and `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`. `x` is the next element in `num_list`.**
