The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the count associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains `x` as a key with its count incremented by 1, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`. The current value of `x` is a key in `num_of_lens` with its count increased by 1.**
