The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `num_of_lens` where the key is `x` and the value is `1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, `res` holds its original value, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` having the value `1`**.
