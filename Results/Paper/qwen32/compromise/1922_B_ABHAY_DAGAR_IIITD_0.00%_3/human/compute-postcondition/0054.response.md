Postcondition: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains `x` as a key with its count incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, or with `1` as its value if `x` was not in `num_of_lens`, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, and `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
