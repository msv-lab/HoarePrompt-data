Postcondition: **`cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `results` is a list with `res` appended to it, where `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains 0. `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer, and `total_count` is 0.**
