The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over `num_list`. To ensure the loop can execute, `num_list` must have at least one element. The other variables mentioned (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, and `total_count`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `num_list` must contain at least one integer. The other variables can remain as they are described in the initial state.

State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`**
