The provided code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `num_of_lens`. The values of the other variables (`results`, `res`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `num_list`) are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it; `res` holds its original value; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**
