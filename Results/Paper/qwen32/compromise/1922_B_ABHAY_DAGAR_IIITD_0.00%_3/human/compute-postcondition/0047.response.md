The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `num_list`. This action updates the value of `num_list` but does not affect the other variables listed in the initial state.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` remains the dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `test_cases` is one less than its initial value, `results` still contains the value of `res`, `n` is still the input integer, `num_list` has been updated to the list of integers from the new input, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` still holds the final accumulated value, and `total_count` still holds the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.
