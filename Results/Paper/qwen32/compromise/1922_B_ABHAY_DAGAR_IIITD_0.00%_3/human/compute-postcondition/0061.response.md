The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` to 1. This means that if `x` was not already in `num_of_lens`, it will be added with a count of 1. If `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its count will be overwritten to 1.

Given the initial state, the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, and `res` are not affected by this line of code. The only variable that changes is `num_of_lens` because the count of `x` is either set to 1 or overwritten to 1.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the next element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens[x]` is 1, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, and `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
