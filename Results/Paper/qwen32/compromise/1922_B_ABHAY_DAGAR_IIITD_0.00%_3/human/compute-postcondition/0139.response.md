Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing all computed `res` values.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the `test_cases` list remains empty, and the `results` list contains all the `res` values that were computed during each iteration of the loop.
