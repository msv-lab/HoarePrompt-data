The code `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. Since `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is increased by 1.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, `res` holds its original value, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary except for the key `x` which has been incremented by 1.**
