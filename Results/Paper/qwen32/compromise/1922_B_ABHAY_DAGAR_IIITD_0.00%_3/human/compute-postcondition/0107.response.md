The code snippet `res = 0` sets the variable `res` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it; `res` is 0; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`.**
