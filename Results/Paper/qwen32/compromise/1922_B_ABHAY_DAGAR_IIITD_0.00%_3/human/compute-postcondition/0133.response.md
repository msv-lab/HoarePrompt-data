In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `result`, which iterates over the `results` list. For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The other variables mentioned (`n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, and `total_count`) are local to each iteration of the loop and do not need to be considered for the loop's execution.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing at least one computed `res` value**
