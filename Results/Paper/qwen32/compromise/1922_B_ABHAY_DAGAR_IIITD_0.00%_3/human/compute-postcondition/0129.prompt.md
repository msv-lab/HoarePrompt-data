Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is a list with `res` appended to it; `res` is 0; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`; `total_count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list with `res` appended to it, where `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains 0. `test_cases` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer. `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer. `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list with `res` appended to it. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to the previous `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is 2, `res` is updated to the previous `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged. `test_cases` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer. `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer. `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`. `cnt` is `next_cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list with `res` appended to it. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to its previous value plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged. `test_cases` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer. `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer. `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`. `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `next_cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `next_cnt` is 2, `res` is updated to the previous `res` plus `next_cnt * (next_cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `next_cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
