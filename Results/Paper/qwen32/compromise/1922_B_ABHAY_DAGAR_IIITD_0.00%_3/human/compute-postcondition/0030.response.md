The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `cnt` to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one integer.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair.
- `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`.
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

To proceed to the next iteration, `cnt` should be the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. Since we do not know the specific values in `num_of_lens`, we will denote the next value as the next element in the sequence of values from `num_of_lens`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is updated based on the previous `cnt` value if applicable**.
