The code snippet `total_count = 0` initializes the variable `total_count` to 0. None of the other variables (`results`, `res`, `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it; `res` is 0; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`; `total_count` is 0.**
