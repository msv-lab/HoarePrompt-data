Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, where `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains 0. `test_cases` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer. `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer. `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `results` has `res` appended to it based on the value of `cnt`. `test_cases` has been decreased by 1. `n` remains the same input integer. `num_list` remains the same list of integers. `total_count` has been updated to its previous value plus `cnt`.
