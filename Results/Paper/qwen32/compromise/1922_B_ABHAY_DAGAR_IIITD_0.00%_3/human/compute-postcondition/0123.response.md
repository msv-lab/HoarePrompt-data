The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`. Therefore, we need to adjust only this variable for the next iteration of the loop. The loop iterates over the values in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` was updated to `next_cnt`, which means that `next_cnt` holds the value of `cnt` for the next iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `num_of_lens.values()` must still have more values to iterate over. Since `cnt` is updated to `next_cnt` at the end of each iteration, the state of `cnt` at the start of the next iteration should be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it. If `next_cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to the previous `res` plus `next_cnt * (next_cnt - 1) * (next_cnt - 2) // 6`. If `next_cnt` is 2, `res` is updated to the previous `res` plus `next_cnt * (next_cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `next_cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged. `test_cases` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer. `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer. `total_count` is `total_count + next_cnt`. `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**
