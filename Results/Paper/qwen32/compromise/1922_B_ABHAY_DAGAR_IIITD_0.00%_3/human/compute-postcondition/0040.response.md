Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the previous `total_count` (before adding the previous `cnt`), `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to include `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` added to its previous value. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is also updated to include `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` added to its previous value. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
