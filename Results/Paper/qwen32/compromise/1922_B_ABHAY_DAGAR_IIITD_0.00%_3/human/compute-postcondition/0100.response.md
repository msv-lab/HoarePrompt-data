The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` to `1`. This means that if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is overwritten to `1`; if `x` was not a key, it is added with the value `1`.

Given the initial state, the only variable affected by this code is `num_of_lens`. The values of `results`, `res`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `num_list` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, `res` holds its original value, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` having the value `1`.**
