The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`, which means `n` will be reassigned to the integer value of the user's input. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, and `total_count`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` remains the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` remains the dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
