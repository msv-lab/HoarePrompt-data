The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the number of ways to choose combinations of three or more identical integers and pairs of identical integers in relation to previously processed integers. The function prints the result for each test case.
