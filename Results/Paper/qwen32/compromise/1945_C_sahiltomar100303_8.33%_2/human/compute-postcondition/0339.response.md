Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an integer greater than 4; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is less than `(mid - 1) // 2`; `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 3) // 2` and has been incremented by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is not '0', otherwise `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`; `left` is `mid - 2`; `leftMove` is `0`; `right` is the final value when the loop stops; `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is not '0'.**
