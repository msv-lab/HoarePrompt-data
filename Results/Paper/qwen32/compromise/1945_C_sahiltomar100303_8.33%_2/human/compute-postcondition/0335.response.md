The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an integer greater than 4; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` (which is less than `(mid - 1) // 2`); `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 3) // 2`; `left` is `mid - 2`; `leftMove` is `0`; `right` is the final value when the loop stops.
