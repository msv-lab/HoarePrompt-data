Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` must be greater than 1; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `-1`; `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1; `leftOne` is `0`; `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s`; `left` is `n // 2`; `leftMove` is `0`; the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0'.**

In natural language: The value of `rightZero` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
