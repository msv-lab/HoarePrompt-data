The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Given that `leftZero` was initially 0, decrementing it by 1 results in a value of -1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 1; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is 2; `trightZero` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is -1; `leftOne` is 0**.
