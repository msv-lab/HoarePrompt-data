Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `0`; `rightZero` is incremented by `3` if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `2`; `leftOne` is `0`; `rightOne` is `rightOne + 2` if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `rightOne + 2`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is incremented by `1` if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `3` and then incremented by `1` again if `s[i]` is not '0'; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is incremented by `1` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne + 2`; `i` is `mid + 2`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block is executed, considering both possible outcomes of the condition `s[i] == '0'`.
