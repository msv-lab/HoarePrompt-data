The code calculates the integer division of `n` by 2 and assigns the result to the variable `mid`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input from the user; `mid` is the integer division of `n` by 2.
Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input from the user; `mid` is `n // 2`.**
