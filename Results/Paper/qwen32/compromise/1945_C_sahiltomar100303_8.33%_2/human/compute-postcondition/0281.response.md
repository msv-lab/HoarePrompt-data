Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0; `leftZero` is `1` if the character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is `0`; `rightZero` is `0`; `leftOne` is `1` if the character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it is `0`; `rightOne` is `0`; `tleftZero` is `1` if the character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is `0`; `trightZero` is `0`; `tleftOne` is `1` if the character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it is `0`; `trightOne` is `0`; `left` is `0` if the loop has not completed its full iteration, otherwise it is not `0`; `leftMove` is `0`; `right` is the final value when the loop stops. If `left` is `0` and `right` equals `n`, then `rightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is not `0` and `right` equals `n`, then `tleftZero` is at least `(n + 1) // 2` if it is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise, it is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`. The character at position `i` in the string `s` is either '0' or not '0', updating `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` accordingly.**
