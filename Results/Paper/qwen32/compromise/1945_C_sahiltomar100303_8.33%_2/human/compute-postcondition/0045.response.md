Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is the string input from the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`; `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`; `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`; `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`; `i` is `mid + 1`. If the character at position `i` in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2 and `trightZero` is 1. Otherwise, `rightZero` is 0 and `trightOne` is 1. `rightOne` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `rightOne` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
