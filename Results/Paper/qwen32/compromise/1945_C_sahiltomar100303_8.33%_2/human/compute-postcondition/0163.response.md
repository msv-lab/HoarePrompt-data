Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `0`. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are increased by 1.**
