Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2`; `rightZero` is adjusted based on the characters moved; `leftOne` is adjusted such that `leftOne` is consistent with `leftZero`; `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2`; `tleftZero` is adjusted such that `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2` if the condition `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2` is true, otherwise `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`; `trightZero` is the count of '0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1` minus the characters moved; `tleftOne` is adjusted such that `tleftOne >= (right + 1) // 2`; `trightOne` is the count of non-'0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1` minus the characters moved; `left` is not equal to 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is `n`.**

This postcondition describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering the condition `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2`. If the condition is true, `tleftZero` is adjusted to be at least `(n + 1) // 2`. If the condition is false, `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables retain their adjusted values as described in the precondition and the respective parts of the if-else block.
