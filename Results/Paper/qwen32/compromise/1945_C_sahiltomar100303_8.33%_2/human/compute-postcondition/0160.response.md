The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `i`, `leftZero`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `0`; `leftZero` is increased by 1; `tleftZero` is increased by 1.**
