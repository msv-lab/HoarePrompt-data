The code snippet converts the set `nums` into a list of integers, sorts the list in ascending order, and then reassigns it to `nums`. The initial state specifies that `nums` contains unique space-separated values from the input line plus the string `'0'`. After sorting, `nums` will be a sorted list of these integers.

Output State: **`N` is the number of test cases, which is an integer input (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^4); `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers, including `0`.**
