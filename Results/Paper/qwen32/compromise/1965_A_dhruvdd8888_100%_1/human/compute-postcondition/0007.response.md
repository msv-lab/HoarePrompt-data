The code snippet simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `nw`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables (`nums`, `ls`). Therefore, the values of `nums` and `ls` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list where the first element is `0` and all other elements are `1`; `ls` is `len(nums) - 1`; `nw` is `True`.**
