Output State: **`N` is the number of test cases, which is an integer input (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^4); `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers, including `0`; `ls` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `ls` has been assigned the value `0`. The values of `N` and `nums` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
