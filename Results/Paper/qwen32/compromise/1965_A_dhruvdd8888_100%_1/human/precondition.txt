The function `sol()` does not take any input arguments. The input is provided via standard input and consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The total number of piles across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
