Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m > 0`. `ans` is a set containing at least two elements, one of which is the value of `x` and another which is `y`. `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` also contains `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', `temp` remains an empty set. `q` is `y`. `temp` now contains `(q + r) % n`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `temp` now includes the result of the expression `(q + r) % n`, where `q` is `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
