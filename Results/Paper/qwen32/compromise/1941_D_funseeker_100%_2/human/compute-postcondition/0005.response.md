The provided Python code snippet initializes a new variable `temp` as an empty set. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, or `c`. The variable `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`, and `m` must be greater than 0. The variables `r` and `c` are derived from the return value of `func_1()`, where `r` is the integer value of a split part of the string, and `c` is another split part of the string.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, where `m` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`; `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set.**
