Postcondition: **`n`, `m` (which is `m - 1` and still greater than 0), and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. `ans` is a set containing at least two values. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is either '0' or '?'. If `c` was '0', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n`. If `c` was '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. `q` is the next element in `ans`.**
