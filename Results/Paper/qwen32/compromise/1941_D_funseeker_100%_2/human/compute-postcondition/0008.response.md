To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the effect of the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m > 0`.
- `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`.
- `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, where `c` is either '0' or '?'.
- `temp` is an empty set.

Code Snippet:
```python
temp.add((q + r) % n)
```

The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. This element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`.

Since the value of `q` is not specified in the initial state, we will denote the new element added to `temp` as `(q + r) % n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m > 0`; `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`; `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, where `c` is either '0' or '?'; `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`.**

In natural language: The output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `temp` now contains the value `(q + r) % n`.
