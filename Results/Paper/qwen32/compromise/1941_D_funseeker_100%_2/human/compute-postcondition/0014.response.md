The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. The element added is `(q + r) % n`. 

Given the initial state, `temp` could either be an empty set or a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` depending on the value of `c`. After the execution of the code, `temp` will definitely contain `(q + r) % n`. If `c` was '1' or '?', then `temp` will now contain three elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and the newly added `(q + r) % n`. However, since sets do not allow duplicate elements, the final state of `temp` will be a set containing `(q + r) % n` and possibly `(q - r) % n` if `c` was '1' or '?'.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m > 0`. `ans` is a set containing at least two elements, one of which is the value of `x`. `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set. After the code snippet, `temp` definitely contains `(q + r) % n` and possibly `(q - r) % n` if `c` was '1' or '?'.**
