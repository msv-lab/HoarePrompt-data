The code snippet adds a new element `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. 

Given the initial state, `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', or it contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1'. If `c` is neither '0', '?', nor '1', `temp` is an empty set. 

After executing the code, `temp` will definitely contain `(q - r) % n`. 

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '1', `temp` contains `(q + r) % n` and two occurrences of `(q - r) % n` (but since it's a set, it will only contain one). Otherwise, `temp` contains `(q - r) % n`. `q` is an element from `ans` that hasn't been iterated over yet.**
