The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` splits the string returned by `func_1()` into two parts: `r` and `c`. This means `r` will hold the first part of the string as an integer, and `c` will hold the second part of the string.

Given the initial state, `r` and `c` are not yet defined. After executing the code, `r` will be an integer and `c` will be a string. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n`, `m` is `m - 1`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is a set containing values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?', or only `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is a set containing the same values as the new `ans`.**
