The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the set `ans` that have not yet been assigned to `q`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is a set containing at least two elements, one of which is the value of `x`. Since `q` has taken on the value of one of the elements in `ans`, for the loop to execute again, `ans` must still contain at least one more element that `q` has not yet taken.

Therefore, we need to adjust `q` to the next value in `ans`. Since we do not know the specific values in `ans` other than `x`, we can denote the next value as `y` (where `y` is an element in `ans` and `y` is not `x`).

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m > 0`. `ans` is a set containing at least two elements, one of which is the value of `x` and another which is `y`. `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` also contains `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', `temp` remains an empty set. `q` is `y`.**
