The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`, `A` is an empty list, and `idx_A` is an empty list. The values of `s`, `A`, and `idx_A` do not affect whether the loop can execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is set by the `range` function in the loop head.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list**
