The code snippet provided initializes a new list named `idx_A`. This action does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `A`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of `idx_A` as an empty list.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list.**
