To determine the output state, let's break down the loop step by step with the given initial state and the code logic.

### Initial State:
- `s`: a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'
- `n`: the length of `s`
- `A`: an empty list
- `idx_A`: an empty list

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using the index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

1. **Condition Check**: If the character `s[i]` is `'>'`:
    - If `idx_A` is empty, append `0` to `A`.
    - If `idx_A` is not empty, calculate `x` as the last element of `A` plus the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`. Append `x` to `A`.
    - Append the current index `i` to `idx_A`.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's assume `s = "><><>"`. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

- **Iteration 0**: `s[0]` is `'>'` 
  - `idx_A` is empty, so append `0` to `A`. Now `A = [0]`.
  - Append `0` to `idx_A`. Now `idx_A = [0]`.

- **Iteration 1**: `s[1]` is `'<'`
  - No action as `s[1]` is not `'>'`.

- **Iteration 2**: `s[2]` is `'>'`
  - `idx_A` is not empty, so calculate `x`:
    - `x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`
    - `x = 0 + (2 - 0) * 1 = 2`
  - Append `2` to `A`. Now `A = [0, 2]`.
  - Append `2` to `idx_A`. Now `idx_A = [0, 2]`.

- **Iteration 3**: `s[3]` is `'<'`
  - No action as `s[3]` is not `'>'`.

- **Iteration 4**: `s[4]` is `'>'`
  - `idx_A` is not empty, so calculate `x`:
    - `x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`
    - `x = 2 + (4 - 2) * 2 = 6`
  - Append `6` to `A`. Now `A = [0, 2, 6]`.
  - Append `4` to `idx_A`. Now `idx_A = [0, 2, 4]`.

### Output State:
After all iterations, the lists `A` and `idx_A` are populated based on the conditions specified in the loop. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`, `A` is [0, 2, 6], `idx_A` is [0, 2, 4].**
