### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it correctly calculates the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query.

**Key Points to Analyze:**

1. **Grid Movement Rules:**
   - Pinballs move left if the current cell contains '<' and right if it contains '>'.
   - After moving, the character in the cell inverts.
   - Pinballs stop when they leave the grid.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the string representing the grid.
   - It calls `func_1` to process the grid and print the results.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It initializes two arrays, `A` and `B`, which seem to store cumulative times for pinballs moving to the right and left, respectively.
   - It calculates these times based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters in the string.
   - It then uses these cumulative times to determine how long it takes for each pinball to leave the grid.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization and Calculation of `A` and `B`:**
  - `A` is calculated based on the positions of '>' characters. It seems to store the cumulative time taken by pinballs to reach each '>' from the left.
  - `B` is calculated based on the positions of '<' characters. It seems to store the cumulative time taken by pinballs to reach each '<' from the right.
  
- **Logic for Calculating Pinball Times:**
  - For each cell `i` in the grid:
    - If `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the time based on the cumulative times in `A` and `B`.
    - If `s[i]` is '<', it calculates the time based on the cumulative times in `A` and `B`.
  - The formula used to calculate the time involves adding and subtracting various components from `A` and `B` based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the given example using the logic described:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Grid: `> <<`
   - For `i = 1` (index 0):
     - Pinball moves right to index 1, then left to index 0, then right to index 1, then right to exit the grid.
     - Total time: 3 seconds.
   - For `i = 2` (index 1):
     - Pinball moves left to index 0, then right to index 1, then right to exit the grid.
     - Total time: 6 seconds.
   - For `i = 3` (index 2):
     - Pinball moves left to index 1, then left to index 0, then left to exit the grid.
     - Total time: 5 seconds.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Grid: `<< <<`
   - For `i = 1` (index 0):
     - Pinball moves left to exit the grid.
     - Total time: 1 second.
   - For `i = 2` (index 1):
     - Pinball moves left to index 0, then left to exit the grid.
     - Total time: 2 seconds.
   - For `i = 3` (index 2):
     - Pinball moves left to index 1, then left to index 0, then left to exit the grid.
     - Total time: 3 seconds.
   - For `i = 4` (index 3):
     - Pinball moves left to index 2, then left to index 1, then left to index 0, then left to exit the grid.
     - Total time: 4 seconds.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Grid: `< > < < < >`
   - For `i = 1` (index 0):
     - Pinball moves left to exit the grid.
     - Total time: 1 second.
   - For `i = 2` (index 1):
     - Pinball moves right to index 2, then left to index 1, then left to exit the grid.
     - Total time: 4 seconds.
   - For `i = 3` (index 2):
     - Pinball moves left to index 1, then left to exit the grid.
     - Total time: 7 seconds.
   - For `i = 4` (index 3):
     - Pinball moves left to index 2, then left to index 1, then left to exit the grid.
     - Total time: 10 seconds.
   - For `i = 5` (index 4):
     - Pinball moves left to index 3, then left to index 2, then left to index 1, then left to exit the grid.
     - Total time: 8 seconds.
   - For `i = 6` (index 5):
     - Pinball moves right to index 6, then left to index 5, then left to index 4, then left to index 3, then left to index 2, then left to index 1, then left to exit the grid.
     - Total time: 1 second.
