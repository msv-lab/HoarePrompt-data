Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input provided such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\), `ac` is either 1 or 2 if `i` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 1 if `s[q]` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 0, `bc` is 1 if `s[q]` is not 'A', otherwise `bc` is 0, and `bc` is incremented by 1 if `i` is not 'A', `s` is a non-empty string, `q` is \(q + 1\).**
