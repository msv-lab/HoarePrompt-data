Postcondition: **`t` remains the same as the initial input. `q` will be equal to `t` after the loop finishes, as it will have incremented from 0 to `t-1`. `s` will be the string from the last test case. `ac` and `bc` will be the counts of 'A' and non-'A' characters, respectively, in the last test case's string. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` is greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.**
