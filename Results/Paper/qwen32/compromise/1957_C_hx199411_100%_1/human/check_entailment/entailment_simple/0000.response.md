### Reasoning:

The problem involves calculating the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves where rooks are placed under specific constraints. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, where for each test case, the number of possible final configurations is computed based on the size of the board and the number of moves already played.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played. It then reads the `k` moves, each consisting of two integers `r_i` and `c_i`.

2. **Counting Moves**: For each move, the program checks if `r_i == c_i`. If true, it increments a counter `num` by 1, indicating that the computer skips its turn. Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2, indicating that both the player and the computer place a rook.

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves**: The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of remaining positions on the board that can still be used for placing rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming**: If `m` is 0 or 1, the number of configurations is 1. Otherwise, the program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations for placing `m` rooks on the board without any two rooks attacking each other. The transition formula used in the DP array is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

5. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the number of possible final configurations.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads and processes the input for each test case.
- **Counting Moves**: The logic for counting the number of moves correctly accounts for when the computer skips its turn.
- **Dynamic Programming Formula**: The DP formula used is appropriate for calculating the number of ways to place `m` non-attacking rooks on an `m x m` board. The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` correctly reflects the combinatorial nature of the problem.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where `m` is 0 or 1 correctly by outputting 1 in these cases.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
