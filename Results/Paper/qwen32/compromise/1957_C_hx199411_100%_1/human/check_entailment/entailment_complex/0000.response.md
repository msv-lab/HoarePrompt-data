### Reasoning:

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the described conditions. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves.

2. **Counting Non-Diagonal Moves:**
   - For each move `(r_i, c_i)`, if `r_i == c_i`, it increments the `num` counter by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).
   - If `r_i != c_i`, it increments the `num` counter by 2 (since both moves are valid and distinct).

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves:**
   - The remaining moves `m` are calculated as `n - num`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `m == 0` or `m == 1`, the program outputs `1` since there is only one possible configuration.

5. **Dynamic Programming for General Cases:**
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with base cases: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The DP formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` is used to fill in the rest of the array.

6. **Output:**
   - The final result for each test case is printed as `dp[m]`.

The logic and the dynamic programming formula seem to correctly account for the constraints and conditions of the problem. The program handles multiple test cases efficiently within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reasoning above, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

**Correctness:** **True**
