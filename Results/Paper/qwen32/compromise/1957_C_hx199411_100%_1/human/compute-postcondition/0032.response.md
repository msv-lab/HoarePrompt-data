The code snippet sets the value of `dp[2]` to 3. This change affects the `dp` list, which was initially a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which was 1. After the code execution, `dp[2]` will be 3.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the conditions encountered in each of the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.**
