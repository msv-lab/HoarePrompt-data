The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the code will compute `dp[3]` using the formula provided.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `dp[i - 1]` is `dp[2]`, which is 5.
- `dp[i - 2]` is `dp[1]`, which is 3.
- The formula is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

Plugging in the values:
- `dp[3] = (5 + (3 - 1) * 3 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[3] = (5 + 2 * 3 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[3] = (5 + 12) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[3] = 17 % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[3] = 17`

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is at least 0, `i` is 3, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations (i.e., `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`), `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 3, the third element is 17, and the rest are 0.**
