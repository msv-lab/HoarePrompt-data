The value of `num` is incremented by 2. Initially, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2. After the increment, if `num` was initially 1, it becomes 3, and if `num` was initially 2, it becomes 4. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1, `i` is `k`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4.**
