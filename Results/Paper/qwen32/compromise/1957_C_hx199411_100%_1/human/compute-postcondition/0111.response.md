Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is at least 0, `i` is -1, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations (i.e., `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`), and `m` is `n - num` which is equal to 1.**
