The code increments the value of `num` by 1. Given that `num` was initially 1 if `c` equals `r`, and 2 otherwise, after the increment, `num` will be 2 if `c` equals `r`, and 3 if `c` does not equal `r`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1, `i` is `k`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 3.**
