The given code snippet sets `num` to 0. This means the previous value of `num` (which was the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2) is overwritten. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1, `num` is 0, `i` is `k - 1` if `m` is 1 or greater, otherwise `i` remains `k - 1`, `c` is the last first integer from the input, `r` is the last second integer from the input. If `m` equals 0, no additional modifications are made. If `m` is 1, `i` is set to `k - 1` and no further changes occur. If `m` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for `3 ≤ i ≤ m` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**.
