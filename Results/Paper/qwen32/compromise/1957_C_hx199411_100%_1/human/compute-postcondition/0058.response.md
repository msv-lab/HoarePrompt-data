Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is either 2 or 3 or 3 or 4, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is 1, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2 or 3. Otherwise, `num` is 3 or 4.**
