The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the previous values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`) remain unchanged as they are not modified in the provided code snippet. The `dp` list is updated specifically at index `i`, and the rest of the list remains the same.

The updated value of `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula: `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the conditions encountered in each of the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and `dp[i]` updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**
