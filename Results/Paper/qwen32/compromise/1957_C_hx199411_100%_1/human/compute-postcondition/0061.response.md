Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is either 3 or 4 or 4 or 5, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is 2, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 3 or 4. Otherwise, `num` is 4 or 5.`**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `num` was 2 or 3, it becomes 3 or 4, respectively. If `num` was 3 or 4, it becomes 4 or 5, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
