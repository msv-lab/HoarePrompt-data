The code snippet reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is an input integer representing the number of test cases, which is not affected by this code snippet. The variables `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n.**
