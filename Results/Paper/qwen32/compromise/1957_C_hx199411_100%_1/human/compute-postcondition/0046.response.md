Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further changes occur. If `m` is 1, `m` remains 1. Otherwise, the `dp` array is fully populated from `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` with each element calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.**

In this output state, `num` has been reset to 0, and all other variables retain their previous values or are recalculated based on the new value of `num`.
