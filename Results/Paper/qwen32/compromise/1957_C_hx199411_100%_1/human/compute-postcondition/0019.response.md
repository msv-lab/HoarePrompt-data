The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of the variable `num` by 1. The initial state does not mention the value of `num`, so we can only state that `num` has been incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is greater than `i + 1`, `c` is the first integer from input, `r` is the second integer from input, `num` is `num + 1`.**
