The given code modifies the value of `dp[i]` based on the values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i]`.

Given:
- `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1 and `dp[2]` set to 3.
- `i` is `k - 1`.

The code snippet:
```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

This modifies the `i`-th element of the `dp` list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 2, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` is the last first integer from the input, `r` is the last second integer from the input, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, and `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.
