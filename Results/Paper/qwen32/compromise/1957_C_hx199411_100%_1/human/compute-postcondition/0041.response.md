Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the conditions encountered in each of the `k` iterations, and `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. Otherwise, the `dp` array will be fully populated from `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` with each element calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged as per the initial state.**
