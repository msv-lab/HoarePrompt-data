The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r` respectively. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `num`, `m`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input.**
