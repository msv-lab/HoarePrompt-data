In the given initial state, we have several variables defined with specific constraints and conditions. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, or `m`. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output is explicitly defined and does not require any further computation or description based on the initial state.

Output: **1**
