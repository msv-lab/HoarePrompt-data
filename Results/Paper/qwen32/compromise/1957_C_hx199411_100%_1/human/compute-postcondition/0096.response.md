The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1` (if `m` is 1 or greater, otherwise it remains `k - 1`), and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `k`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1, `i` is `k`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.**
