The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the constant `k`. Therefore, only these can be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the loop `for i in range(k):`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 from its current value.

Let's summarize the state adjustments:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is the loop's upper bound.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` and `r` are integers read from input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.

Since `i` was 0 at the start of the first iteration and is incremented by 1 after each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` and `r` are integers read from input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
