The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given that `num` is either 1 or 2, after the increment, `num` will be either 3 or 4. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` and `r` are integers read from input, `num` is either 3 or 4, `i` is incremented by 1 if `c` does not equal `r`.**
