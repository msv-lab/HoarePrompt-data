The code snippet `t -= 1` simply decrements the value of `t` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and the `dp` array) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the conditions encountered in each of the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further changes occur. If `m` is 1, `m` remains 1. Otherwise, the `dp` array is fully populated from `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` with each element calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.**
