The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` is initially 0, so after the increment, `num` becomes 1. The value of `m` is initially `n - num`, so after `num` is incremented, `m` becomes `n - 1`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is 1, `m` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, and `c` is equal to `r`.**
