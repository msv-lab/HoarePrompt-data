The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `num`. If `num` has at least one test case, the loop can execute. The loop iterates from the last element to the first element of `num`.

To ensure that the loop executes, `num` must have at least one test case. The loop variable `i` should be initialized to the last index of `num`, which is `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one test case, `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
