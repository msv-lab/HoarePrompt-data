### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

This means that there exists an integer \(k\) such that:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to have some issues. Let's break down the logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
3. It initializes `suma` to 0.
4. It iterates over `i` from 1 to `b` (inclusive).
5. For each `i`, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
6. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`.
7. Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

The logic in the program does not seem to correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it appears to be using a different formula that does not match the problem's requirements.

#### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
  - The only pair is \((1, 1)\).
  - \(1 + 1 = 2\) which is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
  - Expected output: 1.
  - Program output: 1 (assuming the program works correctly for this case).

- **Test Case 2**: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
  - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\).
  - Expected output: 3.
  - Program output: 3 (assuming the program works correctly for this case).

However, the program's logic does not seem to generalize correctly for other test cases. The formula used in the program does not align with the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as per the given logic. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
