Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variables `a` and `b` are now assigned the integer values of the first and second elements of the `info` list, respectively. All other variables (`t` and `T`) remain unchanged.
