The given code snippet updates the value of `x` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This means `x` is recalculated and no longer depends on the previous condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `T` remains greater than 0.
- `info` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line.
- `a` remains the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` remains greater than `i`.
- `suma` remains the previous `suma` plus the newly calculated `x` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, but since `x` is now recalculated, this relationship is no longer directly applicable.
- `x` is now `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `T` is greater than 0; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is greater than `i`; `suma` is the previous `suma` plus the newly calculated `x` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`; `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\); `i` is `i + 1`.**
