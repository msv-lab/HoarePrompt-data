The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers within specified ranges.

After the execution of the code snippet, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the integers provided in the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, where 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**
