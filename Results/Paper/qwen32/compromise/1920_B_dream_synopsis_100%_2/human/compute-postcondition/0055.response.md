Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is not equal to 0; `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`**
