Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing three elements, the last of which is `sums`; `i` is `i + 1`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The `ans` list now contains one additional element, which is the current value of `sums`. All other variables retain their previous values or states.
