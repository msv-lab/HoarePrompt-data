Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is not equal to 0; the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**
