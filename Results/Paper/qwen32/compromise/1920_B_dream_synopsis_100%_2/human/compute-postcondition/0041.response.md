The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `sum1`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the value of `sums` computed after each iteration of the loop.**
