To determine the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop step-by-step and how it modifies the variables.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization:**
  - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the reversed sorted list `a`.
  - `ans` is initialized as an empty list.
  - `sums` is not explicitly initialized but is used within the loop.

- **Loop Iterations:**
  - The loop runs for `k + 1` iterations (from `i = 0` to `i = k`).
  - For `i = 0`:
    - `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
    - This value is appended to `ans`.
  - For `i > 0`:
    - If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
    - Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
    - The new value of `sums` is appended to `ans`.

### Final Output State:
- After `k + 1` iterations, `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements.
- Each element in `ans` corresponds to the computed `sums` at each iteration.

### Conclusion:
- The final state of `ans` will be a list of `k + 1` elements, where each element is computed based on the logic described above.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop, which they are not.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is computed based on the logic: for `i = 0`, `ans[0] = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; for `i > 0`, `ans[i] = sums` updated according to the rules specified in the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `ans` will have `k + 1` elements, with each element calculated based on the current value of `sums` adjusted by the elements of `a` according to the loop's logic.
