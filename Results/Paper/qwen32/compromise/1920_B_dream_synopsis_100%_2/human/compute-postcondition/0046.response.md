The given code snippet only contains the initialization of the `ans` list, setting it to an empty list. No other variables are modified or used in this snippet.

Therefore, the only change is that `ans` is now an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is an empty list.**
