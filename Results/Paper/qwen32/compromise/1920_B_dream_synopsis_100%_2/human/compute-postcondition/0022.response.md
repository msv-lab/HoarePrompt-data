The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given that `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, the list `ans` will now contain two elements: the original `sums` and the newly appended `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums` where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
