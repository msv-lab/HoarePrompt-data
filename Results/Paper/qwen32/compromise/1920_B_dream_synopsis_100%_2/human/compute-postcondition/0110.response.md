The code calculates a new value for `sums` using the existing values of `sum1` and `a`. Specifically, it subtracts twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a` from `sum1`.

Given that `a` is a reversed sorted list, the first `x` elements are the largest `x` elements in the original unsorted list.

Let's break down the changes:
- `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `k`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged except for `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `x` are integers read from the input, `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the previous value(s) of `sums` and the current value of `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
