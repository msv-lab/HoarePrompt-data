The given code modifies the variable `sums` by adding the element at index `i-1` of the list `a` and subtracting twice the element at index `i+x-1` of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are part of the expression used to compute the new value of `sums`.

Given the initial state, `sums` is updated as follows:

- `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.

Since `ans` is a list containing the previous value(s) of `sums` and the current value of `sums`, after the update, `ans` will include the newly computed value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `x` are integers read from the input, `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the previous value(s) of `sums` and the current value of `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
