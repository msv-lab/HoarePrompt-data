Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, where the second element is the value of `sums`; `i` is `k + 1`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k] - 2 * a[k + x]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
