The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified.

Given the initial state, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Since `ans` was initially an empty list, after appending `sums`, `ans` now contains one element, which is `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element, `sums`; `i` is 0; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
