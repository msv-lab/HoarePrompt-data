The code snippet appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This means that the list `ans` now contains the value of `sums` as its last element. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `i` is not equal to 0; and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`. `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
