The code snippet provided updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i-1` from the list `a`. Given that `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, the value being added to `sums` is the `i-th` element from the end of the list `a`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n`, `x`, and `k` remain unchanged as integers read from the input.
- `a` remains a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `sum1` remains the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
- `ans` remains a list containing the previous value(s) of `sums` and the current value of `sums`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `sums` is updated to its previous value plus the element at index `i-1` from the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `x` are integers read from the input, `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the previous value(s) of `sums` and the current value of `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
