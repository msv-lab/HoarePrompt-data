Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is a list containing two elements. If `i` is 0, both elements of `ans` are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, the second element of `ans` is the value of `sums`.
- `i` is 0
- `sums` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the code, it seems to be used before being updated. We assume `sums` is initialized to some value, possibly 0 or derived from previous computations.

Code Snippet:
```python
sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
```

Since `i` is 0, the expression `a[i - 1]` translates to `a[-1]`, which is the last element of the list `a`. Similarly, `a[i + x - 1]` translates to `a[x - 1]`, which is the x-th element of the list `a`.

Thus, the code updates `sums` as follows:
```python
sums = sums + a[-1] - 2 * a[x - 1]
```

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements. If `i` is 0, both elements of `ans` are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, the second element of `ans` is the value of `sums`. `i` is 0; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[-1] - 2 * a[x - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state means that the value of `sums` has been updated by adding the last element of the list `a` and subtracting twice the x-th element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
