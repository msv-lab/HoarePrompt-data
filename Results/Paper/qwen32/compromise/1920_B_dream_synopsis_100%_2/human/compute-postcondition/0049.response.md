The given code calculates a new variable `sums` based on the existing variables `sum1` and `a`. Specifically, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Here, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, and `a[:x]` represents the first `x` elements of the list `a`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `sums`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the reversed sorted list `a`.
- `sum(a[:x])` is the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`.
- `sums` is then calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is an empty list; The current value of `i` is 0; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
