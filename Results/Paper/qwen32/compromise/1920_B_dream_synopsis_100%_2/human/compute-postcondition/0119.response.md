To determine the output of the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the logic implied by the code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n`, `x`: Integers read from the input.
- `k`: An integer read from the input and is at least 0.
- `a`: A reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `sum1`: The sum of the elements in the list `a`.
- `ans`: A list containing `k + 1` values of `sums` computed according to the loop's logic.

### Understanding the Logic:
The list `ans` is constructed with `k + 1` values, likely through some iterative process involving the list `a` and possibly the variables `n`, `x`, and `sum1`. Since the specific loop logic isn't provided, we'll assume that `ans` is populated with sums derived from sublists or combinations of elements from `a`.

### Determining the Output:
The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value found in the list `ans`. Given that `ans` contains `k + 1` sums, the maximum value in this list will be the largest sum computed during the loop's execution.

### Final Output Description:
Since the exact values of `a`, `n`, `x`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `max(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum value found in the list `ans`.

Output: **max(ans) (where max(ans) is the maximum value in the list ans, which contains k + 1 sums computed from the list a)**
