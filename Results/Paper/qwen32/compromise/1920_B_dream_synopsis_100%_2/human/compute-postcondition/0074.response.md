Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is a list containing two elements. If `i` is 0, both elements of `ans` are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, the second element of `ans` is the value of `sums`.
- `i` is 0
- `sums` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the context, it seems `sums` should be initialized to some value before this line of code is executed. However, since it's not given, we'll assume it's initialized to 0 for the purpose of this example.

The code snippet is:
```python
sums = sums + a[i - 1]
```

Since `i` is 0, `i - 1` equals -1. In Python, accessing `a[-1]` gives the last element of the list `a`.

Thus, the line `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` translates to `sums = sums + a[-1]`, which means `sums` is updated to its current value plus the last element of the list `a`.

Therefore, the new value of `sums` is `sums + a[-1]`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements. If `i` is 0, both elements of `ans` are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, the second element of `ans` is the value of `sums`. `i` is 0; `sums` is `sums + a[-1]`.**
