### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its logic step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in the given string `s`.
- If not, we need to provide one such string that does not appear as a subsequence.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase letters.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and removes characters from the alphabet set as they are encountered.
   - When the alphabet set is empty, it resets the set and appends the current character to `s2`.
   - It constructs `s1` as a copy of `s` and calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple:
     - A boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2` which contains characters causing the alphabet set to reset.

3. **Logic Evaluation:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not account for checking subsequences of length `n`. Instead, it focuses on resetting the alphabet set and constructing substrings, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.
   - The function does not generate or check all possible combinations of length `n` from the first `k` letters.
   - The logic to find a missing subsequence is also flawed. It incorrectly assumes that characters in `s2` are relevant to finding a missing subsequence.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - Based on the boolean returned by `func_1`, the code outputs "YES" or "NO".
   - If "NO", it attempts to construct a missing subsequence, but this construction is not based on any correct logic related to the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality to solve the problem. The logic within `func_1` is not appropriate for checking subsequences of length `n` and does not correctly identify missing subsequences.

**Correctness: False**
