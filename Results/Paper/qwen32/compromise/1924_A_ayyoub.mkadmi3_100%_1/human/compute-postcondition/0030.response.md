Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` and `n`. It returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s` starting from index `r * k` to the end (where `r` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement but can be inferred as the quotient of integer division of the length of `s` by `k`), and the string `s2` (which is not defined in the problem statement and seems to be a placeholder or error in the description).**
