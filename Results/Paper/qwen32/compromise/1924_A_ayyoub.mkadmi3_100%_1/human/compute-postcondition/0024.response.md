Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in `s`. If `alphabet` does not contain `i`, then `alphabet` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is updated to include `i` appended to its previous value, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
