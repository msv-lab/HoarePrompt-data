Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in `s`, `s1` and `s2` are determined based on the new `i` and `alphabet`. If `len(alphabet) != 1`, `alphabet` is determined based on the new `i` and no longer contains the character `i`. Otherwise, `alphabet` is reset to `{chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}`.**
