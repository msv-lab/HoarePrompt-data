You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains four integers p1, p2, p3, p4 (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: - The result of the final calculation for each test case is converted to a string and collected into a list.
    #   - `'\n'.join(...)` joins these strings with newline characters to form the final output string.
    #
    #### Output Explanation:
    #The output of the program is a series of integers, one per line, where each integer represents the calculated value for each test case based on the given formula.
    #
    #### Final Output:
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on these counts and outputs the result for each test case on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time from the sequence.
- We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Key Observations:
- The numbers in the sequence are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- The XOR of a sequence can be zero if the sequence can be partitioned into pairs of identical numbers and possibly a single number left over.
- The strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins would involve removing numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence can be partitioned into as many zero-XOR pairs as possible.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by using the following formula:
```python
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

This formula seems to be an attempt to count the maximum number of zero-XOR pairs that can be formed:
- For each number type (1, 2, 3, 4), it calculates the number of pairs (`x // 2`) and possibly an additional single number (`x % 2`).
- The multiplication by 3 and division by 3 seem to be part of a more complex logic that might be incorrect or overly simplified.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some edge cases to see if it works as expected.

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
1
1 1 1 0
```
Output:
```
1
```
Explanation: Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three, leaving two ones and one three, which XOR to zero.

#### Example 2:
Input:
```
1
1 0 1 2
```
Output:
```
1
```
Explanation: Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three, leaving two twos and two fours, which XOR to zero.

#### Example 3:
Input:
```
1
2 2 2 0
```
Output:
```
3
```
Explanation: Bob can win three times by removing numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence can be partitioned into zero-XOR pairs.

#### Example 4:
Input:
```
1
3 3 2 0
```
Output:
```
3
```
Explanation: Bob can win three times by removing numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence can be partitioned into zero-XOR pairs.

#### Example 5:
Input:
```
1
0 9 9 9
```
Output:
```
12
```
Explanation: Bob can win twelve times by removing numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence can be partitioned into zero-XOR pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to produce the correct output for the given examples. However, the logic behind the formula is not immediately clear, and it might be overly simplified or incorrect for some edge cases. Since the problem involves complex logic around XOR and optimal removal of numbers, it's important to ensure that the formula correctly handles all possible scenarios.

Given the complexity and the lack of a clear explanation of the formula, let's consider a more straightforward approach to verify the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
After careful consideration and testing with the provided examples, the program appears to be correct. However, without a clear explanation of the formula, we should be cautious. Since the program produces the correct output for the given examples and there are no obvious errors, we can assume it is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program produces the correct output for the provided examples, and there are no obvious errors or edge cases that it fails to handle. While the logic behind the formula is not immediately clear, the program seems to correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.
