Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. `n` and `m` are integers read from input.
3. `a` is a list of integers read from input, and all elements in `a` are the same.
4. `c` is a list of integers read from input, and all elements in `c` are the same.
5. The first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(0)` statement directly prints the integer `0`. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `c` are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value printed is not dependent on the values of these variables.

### Output:
The code will print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
