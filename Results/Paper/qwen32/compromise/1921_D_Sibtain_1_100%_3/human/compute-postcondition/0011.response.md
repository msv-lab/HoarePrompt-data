To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` and `m` are integers read from input.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with a length of 1.
   - `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order.
   - There is a condition that if all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, no further changes are made to the variables.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Since `a` is a list of integers with a length of 1, it means `a` can be represented as `[x]` where `x` is some integer.
   - Since `c` is sorted in descending order and all elements in `c` are the same, `c` can be represented as `[y, y, y, ..., y]` where `y` is some integer and there are `m` elements in `c`.
   - The condition states that if `x` (first element of `a`) is equal to `y` (first element of `c`), then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
   - Since `a` has only one element, `a[0]` is `x`.
   - Since `c` is sorted in descending order and all elements are the same, `max(c)` and `min(c)` both equal `y`.

3. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - The expression `max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c)))` needs to be evaluated.
   - Since `a[0]` is `x` and `max(c)` and `min(c)` are both `y`, the expression simplifies to `max(abs(x - y), abs(x - y))`.
   - This further simplifies to `abs(x - y)`.

4. **Condition Satisfaction**:
   - If the condition is satisfied (i.e., `x` equals `y`), then `abs(x - y)` equals `0`.
   - If the condition is not satisfied (i.e., `x` is not equal to `y`), then `abs(x - y)` is the absolute difference between `x` and `y`.

5. **Output**:
   - Based on the condition, the output will be `0` if the condition is satisfied, otherwise it will be `abs(x - y)`.

Given the precondition and the analysis, the output can be described as:
Output: **0 if the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, otherwise `abs(a[0] - c[0])` (where `a[0]` is the first element of `a` and `c[0]` is the first element of `c`)**
