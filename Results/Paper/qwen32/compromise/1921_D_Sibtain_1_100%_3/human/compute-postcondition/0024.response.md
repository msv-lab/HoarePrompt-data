The only object in the loop head is the variable `k`. Therefore, we can only adjust `k` to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` and `m` are integers read from input
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with a length of at least 1
- `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order
- `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`
- If `t2` (which is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`) is greater than `t1` (which is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`), then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` would have taken on a value from 0 to `len(a) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, provided it is still less than `len(a)`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with a length of at least 1, `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we are only concerned with the loop head variable `k`, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with a length of at least 1, `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `k + 1`**.
