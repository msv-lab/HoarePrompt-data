The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial state mentions that `n` and `m` are integers read from input, so the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, and `k`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with a length of at least 1; `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order; `i` is the number of times `t1` was the maximum or equal to `t2` during the iterations; `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` during the iterations; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair considered; `k` is equal to `len(a)`**. The values of `n` and `m` have been updated to the integers read from the input.
