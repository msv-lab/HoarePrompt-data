The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, `n` and `m` were not defined, and now they are assigned the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the final value after all comparisons, `j` is the final value after all comparisons**
