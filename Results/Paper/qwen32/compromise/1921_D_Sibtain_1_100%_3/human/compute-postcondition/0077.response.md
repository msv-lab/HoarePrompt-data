To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined and used.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
2. **`n` and `m`**: Integers read from input.
3. **`a`**: A sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`.
4. **`c`**: A list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order.
5. **`ans`**: The sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration.
6. **`k`**: Defined as `len(a) - 1`.
7. **`i` and `j`**: Final values after all comparisons.

### Key Points:
- The variable `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration. However, the specific values of `t1` and `t2` are not provided in the initial state. 
- The variables `i` and `j` are mentioned as final values after all comparisons, but their exact values are not given.
- The list `a` is sorted in ascending order, and the list `c` is sorted in descending order.

### Calculation of `ans`:
Since the exact values of `t1` and `t2` are not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration. The exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration. Since the specific values of `t1` and `t2` are not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of this sum.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(t1, t2) for each iteration)**
