The function `calculate_hcf(numbers)` is not relevant to the problem description provided. The correct function definition should be `def distribute_bets(test_cases)`, where `test_cases` is a list of test cases, each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). The number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is not part of the input to the function but is mentioned in the problem description. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
