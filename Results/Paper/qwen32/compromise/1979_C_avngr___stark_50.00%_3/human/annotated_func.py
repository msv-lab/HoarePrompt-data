#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements for each test case. Each pair consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is unchanged, `hcf` is the GCD of `t` and all multipliers `k_i` from all test cases, `num` is the last multiplier from the last test case.
    return hcf
    #The program returns `hcf`, which is the GCD of `t` and all multipliers `k_i` from all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `numbers` where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements for each test case. Each pair consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `k_i`. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `t` and all the integers `k_i` from all test cases.
