Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements for each test case. Each pair consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `hcf` is assigned the value `t`.
Code of the loop:
for num in numbers[1:]:
    hcf = gcd(hcf, num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, the second element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes for the first test case, and the next `n` elements are the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of `t` and `k_1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, the second element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes for the first test case, and the next `n` elements are the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of `t` and `k_1`, `num` is `k_1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, the second element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes for the first test case, and the next `n` elements are the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20); `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the initial `hcf` and `k_2`; `num` is `k_2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
