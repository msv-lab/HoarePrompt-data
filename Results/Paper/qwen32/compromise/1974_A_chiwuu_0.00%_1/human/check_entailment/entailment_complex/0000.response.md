Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. Each screen is a 5x3 grid (15 cells).
2. There are two types of icons: 1x1 (1 cell) and 2x2 (4 cells).
3. We need to minimize the number of screens required to place all icons.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - `t = b * 2`: This calculates the total number of cells required for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, `b * 4` cells are needed, but the program uses `b * 2`. This is incorrect as it should be `b * 4`.
   - The program then calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons:
     ```python
     if t % 5 == 0:
         t = t // 5
     else:
         t = t // 5 + 1
     ```
     This part is correct in terms of rounding up to the nearest integer, but it is based on an incorrect value of `t` (it should be `b * 4`).

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells and Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons. `t * 15` is the total number of cells used by the screens allocated for 2x2 icons, and `b * 4` is subtracted to get the remaining cells.
   - The program then checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to place the 1x1 icons:
     ```python
     if t1 >= a:
         t = t
     else:
         t2 = a - t1
         if t2 % 15 == 0:
             t = t + t2 // 15
         else:
             t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
     ```
     This part is correct in terms of calculating additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

### Correctness:
The program has a critical error in the calculation of `t` for the 2x2 icons. It should use `b * 4` instead of `b * 2`. This error will lead to incorrect results for many test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.

**Correctness: False**
