To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it accurately implements the rules of the game and determines the correct winner for each test case.

### Game Analysis:
The key to solving this problem is to understand the game mechanics and the optimal strategy for both players. Here are the main points to consider:

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Players take turns.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - They must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The game is symmetric, and the optimal strategy depends on the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win if both play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win if both play optimally.

### Explanation of the Program:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1(a, b)` and `func_2()`.
- `func_1(a, b)` determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins (a + b).
- `func_2()` handles input and output for multiple test cases.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **func_1(a, b)**:
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

2. **func_2()**:
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner.
   - It stores the result and prints it after processing all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic based on the game's optimal strategy. Therefore, it will produce the correct output for the given problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, which is the optimal strategy for the game.
Correctness: **True**
