To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to systematically analyze the logic and reasoning behind the solution and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with their wallets.
- Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
- After choosing, the player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both play optimally.

### Key Points:
- The game's outcome depends on the total number of coins (`a + b`).
- If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Determines the winner based on the total number of coins.
2. `func_2()`: Handles input and output for multiple test cases.

#### func_1(a, b):
This function checks if the sum of coins (`a + b`) is even or odd and returns 'Bob' or 'Alice' accordingly. The logic is:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'
```
This logic aligns with the problem description.

#### func_2():
This function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the result for each test case. The logic is:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```
This function also adheres to the problem description.

### Verification:
The provided code correctly implements the logic based on the problem description. It correctly determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in both players' wallets. The annotations provided validate the state of the program at key points, confirming the logic is sound.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, it appears to be correct for all potential cases as per the problem description. The annotations provided do not challenge the original assessment and instead support the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program correctly determines the winner based on whether the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even or odd, which matches the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. No edge cases were found where the program fails to produce the expected result.
