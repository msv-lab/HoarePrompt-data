You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Bob'
        #The program returns 'Bob'
    else :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both within the range 1 to 10^9. It returns 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1(a, b)` for the corresponding test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `a` and `b` remain the same integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively; `t` remains the same input integer representing the number of test cases; `results` remains the same list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1(a, b)` for the corresponding test case. The function `func_1(a, b)` has been executed `t` times, and its results have been printed, but the variables `a`, `b`, `t`, and `results` themselves have not been altered by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads two integers representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have. It then determines the winner of a game (presumably defined in `func_1`) for each test case and prints the result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it accurately implements the rules of the game and determines the correct winner for each test case.

### Game Analysis:
The key to solving this problem is to understand the game mechanics and the optimal strategy for both players. Here are the main points to consider:

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Players take turns.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - They must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The game is symmetric, and the optimal strategy depends on the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win if both play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win if both play optimally.

### Explanation of the Program:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1(a, b)` and `func_2()`.
- `func_1(a, b)` determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins (a + b).
- `func_2()` handles input and output for multiple test cases.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **func_1(a, b)**:
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

2. **func_2()**:
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner.
   - It stores the result and prints it after processing all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic based on the game's optimal strategy. Therefore, it will produce the correct output for the given problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, which is the optimal strategy for the game.
Correctness: **True**
