To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. In each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively. It then calls a function `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner of some game or condition based on `a` and `b`, and appends the result to the `results` list.

Since the loop runs `t` times, and each time it appends a result to the `results` list, after all iterations, the `results` list will contain `t` elements, each representing the result of the game or condition for the corresponding test case.

The initial state of `a` and `b` before the loop starts does not affect the final output state as they are reassigned in each iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it determines the number of iterations. The `results` list is the only variable that is modified by the loop.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1(a, b)` for the corresponding test case.**
