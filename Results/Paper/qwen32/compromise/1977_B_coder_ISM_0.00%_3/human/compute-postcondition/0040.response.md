Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing 30 elements where the first element is either '1', '0', or '-1' and the second element is either '1' or '0'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[1]` is '0', then `s[1]` is updated to '1'. `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1; `i` is 1.**
