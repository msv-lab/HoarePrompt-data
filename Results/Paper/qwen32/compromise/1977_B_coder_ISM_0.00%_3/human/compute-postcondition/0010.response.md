Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either ['1'] or ['0'] depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not; `length` is 30; `i` is a non-negative integer. If the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, `s` contains ['1']. Otherwise, `s` contains ['0'].**
