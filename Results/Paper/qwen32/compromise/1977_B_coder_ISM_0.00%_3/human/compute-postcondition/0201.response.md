Postcondition: **`length` is 30, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 0, and `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x` with the least significant bit first. If `flag` was originally 1, then `flag` is now 0 and the first element of `s` is `'0'`. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0. The condition `flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1'` is false.**
