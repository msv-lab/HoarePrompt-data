Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a variable with its initial state. If `flag` is `True` and the 30th character of the string `s` is '1', then `s[29]` is '0'. If `flag` is `True` and the 30th character of the string `s` is not '1', then `s` includes an additional element `'1'` at the end and `length` is incremented by 1. If `flag` is `False`, then no changes are made to `s` or `length`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `length` is greater than 1, and `s` is a sequence. If the current element `s[i]` is '-1' and the previous element `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is changed to '0'. Otherwise, `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `i` in `s` is `'-1'` and the element at index `i - 1` in `s` is `'1'`, then `s` remains unchanged except for the increment of `i`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged and `i` is still incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then the `i-1`-th element of `s` is set to `'-1'`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
