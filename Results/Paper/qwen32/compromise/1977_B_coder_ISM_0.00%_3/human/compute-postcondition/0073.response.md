The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `length`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `length`. If `i` is less than `length`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `length` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` has just completed its current iteration, so we need to increment `i` by 1. The value of `length` remains the same.

State: **`length` is greater than 1, and `s` is a sequence, `i` is incremented by 1**
