Output State: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, where each element is either '1' or '0', except `s[27]` which is now '0'. `length` is 30. `t` remains unchanged. `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 30. `flag` retains its original value. `i` is 27.**

Explanation: The value of `s[27]` is now '0' because the code explicitly sets `s[i]` to '0' and `i` is 27. All other variables retain their original values as described in the initial state.
