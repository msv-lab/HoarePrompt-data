Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either ['1'] or ['0'] depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, and now also contains an additional '1' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or an additional '0' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set; `length` is 30; `i` is `i + 1`.**
