The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string '1' to the list `s`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`length` is 30, `x` is an integer, `i` is 4, `s` has a new element '1' appended to it. If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1, `s` had '1' appended; otherwise, `s` had '0' appended, and now `s` has an additional '1' appended to it.**
