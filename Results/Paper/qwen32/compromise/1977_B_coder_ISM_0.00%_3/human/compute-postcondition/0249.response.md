Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each execution, it will process an input integer `x` to create a binary string `s` of length 30 or 31. The string `s` will be transformed such that no two '1's are consecutive, and all `'-1'`s will be replaced by '0's. The final `s` for each `x` will be printed, followed by the length of `s` and then the transformed `s`. The variable `t` remains unchanged after all iterations.**

In simpler terms, the loop will run `t` times, processing each input integer `x` to create a binary string `s` of length 30 or 31, ensuring no consecutive '1's and replacing `'-1'`s with '0's. After processing each `x`, it will print the length of the transformed string and the string itself. The initial value of `t` will remain the same after all iterations.
