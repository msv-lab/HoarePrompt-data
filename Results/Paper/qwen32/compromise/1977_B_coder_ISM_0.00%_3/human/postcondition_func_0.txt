The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x` and processes it to create a binary representation of length 30 or 31. It then transforms this binary representation to ensure no two '1's are consecutive, replacing any `'-1'`s with '0's. The function prints the length of the transformed binary string and the transformed string itself for each test case.
