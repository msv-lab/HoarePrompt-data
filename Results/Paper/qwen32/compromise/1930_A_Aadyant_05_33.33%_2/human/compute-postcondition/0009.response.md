The code snippet `list1.sort()` sorts the list `list1` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `out`, and `list2` remain unchanged. The only change is that `list1` is now sorted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is an integer, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`.**
