The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `out`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `num`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7; `num` is a string equal to the user input; `out` is an empty list.**
