The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) representing the size of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
