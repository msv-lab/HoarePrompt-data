The code snippet `n -= Min * Max` subtracts the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`. Given the initial state, we can determine the new value of `n` by performing this calculation.

- If `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, then `number` is `Min` and `k` is `0`. However, since `k` is a positive integer or `0` under specific conditions, we'll consider the general case where `k` is positive.
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` and `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`. Therefore, `Min * Max` is the product of these two values.
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.

The other variables (`t`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged unless their values are directly dependent on `n`. In this case, they are not.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is `n - Min * Max`; `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n` (or `k` is 0 if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`); `rep` is 0; `tab` is a list containing one element `str(number)`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**
