Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is a positive integer; `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n` (or `k` is 0 if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`); `rep` is 0; `tab` is a list containing one element `str(number)`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**

In simple terms, the variable `tab` now contains one element, which is the string representation of `number`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
