Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is a positive integer; `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n` (or `k` is 0 if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`); `rep` is 0; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**

This postcondition captures the state of the variables after the if-else block has executed, considering both branches of the conditional statement.
