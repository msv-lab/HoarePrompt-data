Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than `Min * Max + k`; `k` is an integer greater than 0 and updated to `k - Min` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`, otherwise `k` is an integer less than or equal to 0; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Max` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`, otherwise `number` is `Min`.**
