The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

### Explanation:
- The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max`, but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
