To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that all conditions in the loop head are satisfied. The loop head is:

```
while n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k):
```

Let's analyze each condition:

1. **`n != 0`**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is `n - Min * Max`. For the loop to continue, `n` must not be zero. Therefore, we need to ensure that after the update, `n` is still greater than 0.

2. **`k > 0`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is updated to `k - Min` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`. Otherwise, `k` is set to a value less than or equal to 0. To ensure the loop continues, `k` must be greater than 0.

3. **`rep < 60`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `rep` is 2. Since `rep` is incremented in each iteration, we need to ensure that `rep` is less than 60. Given that `rep` is 2, it is far from reaching 60, so no adjustment is needed for this condition.

4. **`n >= k`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and `k` is either `k - Min` or a value less than or equal to 0. To ensure the loop continues, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust `n` and `k` to ensure they satisfy all the conditions for the loop to execute one more time:

- `n` must be greater than 0 after the update (`n = n - Min * Max`).
- `k` must be greater than 0 after the update (`k = k - Min` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`).

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- Ensure that `n - Min * Max` is greater than 0.
- Ensure that `k - Min` is greater than 0 if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is such that `n - Min * Max` is greater than 0; `k` is such that `k - Min` is greater than 0 if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`; `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Max` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`, otherwise `number` is `Min`**
