Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is the first integer read from the input; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `rep` is 0; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated; `number` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is `n - Min * Max`; `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n` (or `k` is 0 if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`); `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing one element `str(number)`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is the original value of `n` before the addition of `Min * Max`; `k` is `k - Max` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is `k - Min` (and `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n`); `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing two elements `str(number)`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is `t - 1` and must still be greater than 0; `n` is the original value of `n` minus `Min * Max` and `n - Min * Max >= k`; `k` is `k - Max` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is `k - Min` (and `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n - Min * Max`); `rep` is 3; `tab` is a list containing three elements `str(number)`, `str(number)`, `str(number)`; `Min` is `min((n - Min * Max) // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(int((n - Min * Max) / k), k)`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and (n - Min * Max) * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
