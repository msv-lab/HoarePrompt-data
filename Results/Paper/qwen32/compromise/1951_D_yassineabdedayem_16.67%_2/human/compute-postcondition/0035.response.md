Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 2 or greater; `rep` is 2; `number` is either 1 or 2; `tab` is either `['2', '1']` or `['2', '3']`; `Min` is 1; `Max` is 2; `k` is either 0 or 1. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is 1 and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `number` is 2 and `k` is 1.**
