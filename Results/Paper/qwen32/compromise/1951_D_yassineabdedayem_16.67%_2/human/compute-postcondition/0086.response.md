Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is such that `n - Min * Max` is greater than 0; `k` is either `k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, or `k - Min` otherwise; `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**
