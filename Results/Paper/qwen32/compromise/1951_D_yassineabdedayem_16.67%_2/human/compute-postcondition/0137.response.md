Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is the original value of `n` before the addition of `Min * Max` and `n >= k`; `k` is `k - Min` (and `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n`); `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing two elements `str(number)`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`; `number` is `Max`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is now `k - Min`, while all other variables retain their previous values. `t` remains `t - 1` and is still greater than 0. `n` retains its original value before any additions. `rep` is still 2, and `tab` is still a list containing two elements, each being `str(number)`. `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the new value of `k`, but their specific values are not changed in this output state description. `number` remains `Max`.
