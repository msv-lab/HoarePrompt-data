The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`. Given that `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, the new value of `k` will be `k - Max`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is such that `n - Min * Max` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - Max`; `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Min`**.
