Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is `n + Min * Max`; `k` is `k - Max` (or `k` is 0 if `Max == k`); `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing one element `str(number)`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`; `number` is `Min`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`. All other variables retain their previous values. If `Max` is equal to `k`, then `k` becomes 0. The conditions on `t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` remain unchanged.
