To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop for each test case. The loop processes each test case one by one, and for each test case, it performs operations until either `n` becomes 0, `k` becomes 0, the number of repetitions (`rep`) reaches 60, or `n` becomes less than `k`.

Given the provided initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **Initial State**: `t` is the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Loop Behavior**: For each test case, the loop runs while `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`. Inside the loop, it calculates `Min` and `Max` based on `n` and `k`, updates `number`, `k`, `tab`, `n`, and `rep`, and appends `number` to `tab`.
3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when one of the conditions `n == 0`, `k == 0`, `rep == 60`, or `n < k` is met. If `k == 0`, it prints "YES", the length of `tab`, and the elements of `tab`. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

After all test cases have been processed, the final state of the variables will be:

- `t` will be 0 because all test cases have been processed.
- `n` and `k` will be the values left from the last test case processed.
- `rep` will be the number of iterations the loop ran for the last test case.
- `tab` will be the list of string representations of `number` for the last test case if `k` was 0.
- `Min` and `Max` will be the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated.
- `number` will be the last computed value in the loop for the last test case.

The final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **t is 0; n and k are the values from the last test case; rep is the number of iterations for the last test case; tab is the list of numbers for the last test case if k was 0; Min and Max are the last computed values for the last test case; number is the last computed value for the last test case.**

In simpler terms, after all test cases have been processed, `t` will be 0, indicating no more test cases are left. The variables `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` will reflect the state of the last test case processed. If `k` was 0 for the last test case, `tab` will contain the sequence of numbers that were computed.
