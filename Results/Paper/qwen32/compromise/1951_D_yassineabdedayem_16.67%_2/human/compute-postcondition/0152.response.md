To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and the variables' states throughout its execution. 

The provided code snippet is a `for` loop that iterates over the `tab` list, printing each element followed by a space. The loop's behavior depends on the `tab` list's length, which is determined by the number of iterations (`rep`) the loop ran before it terminated.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop variable `i` iterates over the `tab` list.
- `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration and must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
- `n` and `k` remain 0 throughout the loop.
- `rep` is the total number of iterations the loop ran, capped at 60.
- `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration.
- `Min` and `Max` are computed based on the final values of `n` and `k` before the loop terminated.
- `number` is the last computed value in the loop.

Since the loop iterates over `tab`, the number of iterations is equal to the length of `tab`. The final output state will reflect that the loop has completed all iterations, and `i` will have iterated over the entire `tab` list.

Let's assume `rep` is the final number of iterations, and `tab` has `rep` elements. The loop will print each element of `tab` followed by a space. After the loop finishes, `i` will have taken on the value of the last element in `tab`.

### Final Output State
- `t` will be `t - rep` and still greater than 0 (or equal to 0 if it stopped just in time).
- `n` will remain 0.
- `k` will remain 0.
- `rep` will be the total number of iterations the loop ran.
- `tab` will be a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration.
- `Min` and `Max` will be the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated.
- `number` will be the last computed value in the loop.
- `i` will be the last element in `tab`.

Given that the loop has executed all iterations, the final `i` will be the last element of `tab`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - rep` and still greater than 0; `n` is 0; `k` is 0; `rep` is the number of iterations the loop ran (up to 60); `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration and has `rep` elements; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated; `number` is the last computed value in the loop; `i` is the last element in `tab`.**

In simple terms, the loop has printed all elements of `tab` followed by a space, and the final state reflects that the loop has completed all its iterations.
