Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` and still greater than 0; `n` is 0; `k` is 0; `rep` is the number of iterations the loop ran (up to 60); `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated; `number` is the last computed value in the loop. The current value of `k` is 0.**
