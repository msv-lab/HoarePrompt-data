To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the variables involved. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State and Loop Condition**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer (possibly 0).
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is an integer between 0 and 60.
   - `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration.
   - `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for i in tab:
       print(i, end=' ')
   ```
   - This loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `tab` and prints it followed by a space.

3. **Output States After Iterations**:
   - **After 1 iteration**: `tab` has at least one element.
   - **After 2 iterations**: `tab` has at least two elements.
   - **After 3 iterations**: `tab` has at least three elements, and `i` is `tab[1]`.

From the above, it is clear that the loop will execute as many times as there are elements in `tab`. The loop will terminate when all elements of `tab` have been processed.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - The loop will print all elements of `tab` separated by spaces.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body.
   - `tab` will still contain the same list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration.

**Output State**: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is a non-negative integer (possibly 0); `k` is 0; `rep` is an integer between 0 and 60; `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated; all elements of `tab` have been printed, each followed by a space.**

In simple terms, the final output state means that all elements of the list `tab` have been printed in sequence, separated by spaces, and the other variables remain in their initial state.
