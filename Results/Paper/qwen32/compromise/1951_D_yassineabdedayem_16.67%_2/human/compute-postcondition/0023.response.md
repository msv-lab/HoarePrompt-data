The variable `number` is assigned the value of `Max`, which is 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 3; `k` is 3; `rep` is 1; `number` is 3; `tab` is either `['2']` or `['5']`; `Min` is 1; `Max` is 3**.
