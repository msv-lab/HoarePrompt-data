The code snippet updates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, `Min` is set to the smaller of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is set to the larger of `int(n / k)` and `k`. Since `int(n / k)` is equivalent to `n // k` for integer division, `Max` effectively becomes the larger of `n // k` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is a positive integer; `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n`; `rep` is 0; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`; `number` is 0**.
