Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, the function summary, and the original assessment.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, considering that each sign must occur sequentially. Specifically, if the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the (i+1)-th sign must occur strictly after year `x`. The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.

### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

### Function Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints the smallest year in which all signs will occur based on their periodicities.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the provided program is incorrect. It claims that the formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is incorrect and should be `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

### Analysis:
Let's analyze the formula in the provided code:
- `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`

This formula is intended to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`. However, the addition of `+1` inside the formula is indeed incorrect. The correct formula, as suggested in the original assessment, should be:
- `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`

This formula correctly finds the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the formula with the example provided in the original assessment:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2
  3 2
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  4
  ```
- Explanation:
  - The first sign occurs in year 3.
  - The tribe waits for the second sign starting from year 4.
  - The second sign occurs in year 4 (since 4 is a multiple of 2 and is the smallest multiple of 2 greater than 3).

Using the original code's formula:
- `start_year = 0`
- First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3`
- Second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6`

The output is 6, which is incorrect.

Using the corrected formula:
- `start_year = 0`
- First sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3`
- Second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4`

The output is 4, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program contains an error in the formula used to calculate the next occurrence of each sign. The corrected formula should be used.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
