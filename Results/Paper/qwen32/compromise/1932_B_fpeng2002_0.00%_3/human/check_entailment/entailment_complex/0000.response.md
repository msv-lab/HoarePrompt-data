### Reasoning:

The function `func()` is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and the list of periodicities, `nums`.

2. **Calculating the Year of the Nth Sign:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the year in which the current sign is expected to occur.
   - For each sign (periodicity `nums[x]`), the function calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. This is done by:
     - Adding 1 to `start_year` because the next sign must occur strictly after the previous one.
     - Dividing the result by the periodicity `nums[x]` and taking the ceiling (achieved by `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1)`) to find the next multiple of `nums[x]`.
     - Multiplying back by `nums[x]` to get the exact year.
   - This loop continues until all signs have been processed.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the function prints the year in which the last (nth) sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the logic with the first example from the problem statement:

- **Input:**
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```
- **Processing:**
  - `start_year = 0`
  - First sign (periodicity 3):
    - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - Second sign (periodicity 2):
    - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign (periodicity 4):
    - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign (periodicity 5):
    - `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign (periodicity 9):
    - `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign (periodicity 18):
    - `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
- **Output:**
  ```
  36
  ```

The function correctly calculates the year in which the last sign occurs according to the given periodicities.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
