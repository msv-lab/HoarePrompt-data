Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `num_tests` is at least 0. (This variable is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific task.)
2. `n` is an input integer. (The exact value of `n` is not provided, but it is used to determine the length of the `nums` list.)
3. `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input. (The exact values of the integers in `nums` are not provided, but we know it is a list of integers of length `n`.)
4. `start_year` is the result of nested calculations involving all elements in `nums`. (The exact formula or calculation for `start_year` is not provided, so we can only describe it in terms of `nums`.)
5. `x` is `len(nums) - 1`. (This variable is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific task.)

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(start_year)
```

### Analysis:
- `start_year` is described as the result of nested calculations involving all elements in `nums`. Since the exact calculations are not provided, we can only describe `start_year` in terms of the `nums` list.
- The `print` statement will output the value of `start_year`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(start_year)` statement will print the value of `start_year`, which is the result of the nested calculations involving all elements in the `nums` list.

### Final Output:
Output: **start_year (where start_year is the result of nested calculations involving all elements in the `nums` list)**
