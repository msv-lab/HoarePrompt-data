Output State: **`num_tests` is at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is `nums[0]`, `x` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `start_year` is updated based on the calculation `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given `start_year` is initially 0 and `x` is 0, the expression simplifies to `((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, which is `(1 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`. Since `1 // nums[0]` is 0 (integer division), the expression further simplifies to `(0 + 1) * nums[0]`, which is `nums[0]`. Therefore, `start_year` becomes `nums[0]`. The values of `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged.
