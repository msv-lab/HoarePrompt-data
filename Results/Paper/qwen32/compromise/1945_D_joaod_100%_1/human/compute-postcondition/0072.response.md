Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, `c` is the next integer in the range(cases), and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is set to `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is set to `total` + `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
