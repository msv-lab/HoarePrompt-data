The code snippet provided is:
```
custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

This line of code takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns this list of integers to the variable `custo_pra_trocar_a`.

Given the initial state, all other variables (`t`, `cases`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, `best`, `c`) remain unchanged. The only change is that `custo_pra_trocar_a` is reassigned to a new list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the new input, `pos_final` is the second integer from the new input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` down to `0`, `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` that are less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `c` is `c + 1`.**

In simpler terms, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is updated to a new list of integers from the input, while all other variables retain their previous values.
