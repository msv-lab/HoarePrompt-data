Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and the current value of `best` is updated to a value less than `sys.float_info.max` if `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the previous `best`.**
