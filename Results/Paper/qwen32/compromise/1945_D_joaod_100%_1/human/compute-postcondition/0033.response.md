Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In natural language, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. All other variables retain their initial values.
