Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`; `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

In simpler terms, the value of `na_frente` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
