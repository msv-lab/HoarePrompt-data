The only objects in the loop head are the variable `v` and the range parameters `na_frente` and `-1`. However, since `na_frente` and `-1` are constants provided in the range function, they do not change during the loop iterations. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `v`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was used in the loop condition and the loop body. Since the loop decrements `v` by 1 in each iteration (as indicated by the range `range(na_frente, -1, -1)`), we need to adjust `v` to the next value it should take in the next iteration.

Given that `na_frente` is the starting value of `v`, and it decrements by 1 each time, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `v` decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

So, if `v` was `na_frente` at the start of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `v` should be `na_frente - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`**
