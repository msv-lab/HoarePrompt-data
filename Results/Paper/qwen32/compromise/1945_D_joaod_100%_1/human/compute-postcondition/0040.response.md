The code snippet `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increases the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless `best` is updated by the conditional statement outside the provided code snippet, but since that statement is not executed in the given code, `best` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `v` is 0, `total` is `total` + `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or remains unchanged.**
