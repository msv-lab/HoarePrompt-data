### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the maximum profit Bob can make from selling `n` buns, where the first `k` buns can be sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`, and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The provided code logic is as follows:
1. For each test case, read `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. Determine the maximum `k` which is the minimum of `n` and `b - a + 1`. This ensures that we do not attempt to sell more buns at a decreasing price than we have or than the sequence of decreasing prices allows.
3. If `b <= a`, it means selling at the modified price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
4. Otherwise, the profit is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series for the first `k` buns at the modified price plus the usual price for the remaining `n - k` buns.

The arithmetic series sum formula used is `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`, which correctly computes the sum of the first `k` terms of the series starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.

The code handles all edge cases, such as when `b <= a` and when `n` is very large. The logic matches the problem description, and the formula for the sum of the arithmetic series is correctly applied.
