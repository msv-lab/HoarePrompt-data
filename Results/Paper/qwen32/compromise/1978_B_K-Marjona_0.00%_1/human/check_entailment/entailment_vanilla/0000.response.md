Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determine `k`:**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is a reasonable approach because `k` cannot exceed the number of buns `n`, and it also cannot exceed `b - a` (the number of times the price can decrease before it becomes less than or equal to the usual price `a`).

3. **Calculate Maximum Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, the program correctly prints `a * n` because there's no benefit to selling any buns at a reduced price.
   - If `b > a`, the program calculates the profit as follows:
     - The sum of the prices of the first `k` buns sold at reduced prices is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
       \[
       \text{Sum} = \frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \times k}{2}
       \]
     - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the total profit.
     - The total profit is then printed as the sum of these two parts.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the examples:

- **Input:** `4 4 5`
- **Calculation:**
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = min(4, 1) = 1`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is calculated as:
    - Sum of the first `k` buns: \((5 + (5 - 1 + 1)) \times 1 / 2 = 5\)
    - Remaining buns: `(4 - 1) * 4 = 12`
    - Total profit: `5 + 12 = 17`
- **Output:** `17` (matches the expected output)

The program correctly handles this case and similar cases as per the examples provided.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to calculate the maximum profit according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
