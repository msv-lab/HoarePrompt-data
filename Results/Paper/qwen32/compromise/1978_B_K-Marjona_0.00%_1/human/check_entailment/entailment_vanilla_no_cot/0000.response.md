To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic and compare it to the problem requirements.

### Problem Summary:
Bob sells `n` buns. The first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`, and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The goal is to find the maximum profit Bob can make by choosing an optimal `k`.

### Program Logic:
The provided program does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
4. If `b <= a`, it prints `a * n` because it's not beneficial to sell any buns at a decreasing price.
5. Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula:
   \[
   \text{profit} = \left(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2}\right) \times k + (n - k) \times a
   \]
   This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for the first `k` buns and adds the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

### Analysis:
The formula used in the program is correct for calculating the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the common difference is `-1`. The formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series is:
\[
S_k = \frac{k}{2} \times (2a + (k-1)d)
\]
For our series, `a = b` and `d = -1`, so:
\[
S_k = \frac{k}{2} \times (2b + (k-1)(-1)) = \frac{k}{2} \times (2b - k + 1) = \frac{k \times (b + (b - k + 1))}{2}
\]
This matches the formula used in the program.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `b <= a`:** The program correctly returns `a * n` because selling at a decreasing price would not be beneficial.
2. **When `b > a`:** The program correctly calculates the maximum profit by choosing an optimal `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case according to the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
