You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    t = int(input())

        t = t - 1

        a = [1000]

    #State: `t` is 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`; `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[(1000 - sum(T[:n-1])), ..., (1000 - T[0]), 1000]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the new input string provided by the user; `i` is `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. It then computes a list `a` of `n` integers based on the input list and prints this list as a space-separated string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the array `a` such that `a_i mod a_(i-1) = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. Let's analyze why:

1. **Initialization of `a`:** The array `a` is initialized with `[1000]`, which is arbitrary and does not guarantee the required properties.
2. **Generating `a`:** The loop `for i in range(1, n): a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` attempts to build the array `a` but uses subtraction instead of addition or another valid method to ensure the modulo condition is met.
3. **Reversing `a`:** The array `a` is reversed before being printed, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

Let's consider a simple counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1
```

**Expected Output:** An array `a` such that `a_2 mod a_1 = 1` and `a_3 mod a_2 = 1`. One possible solution is `a = [2, 3, 4]`.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
899 999
```

Explanation of the actual output:
- `a[0]` is initialized to `1000`.
- `a[1]` is calculated as `a[0] - T[0] = 1000 - 1 = 999`.
- `a[2]` is calculated as `a[1] - T[1] = 999 - 1 = 998`.
- The array is then reversed, resulting in `[998, 999]`.

This output does not satisfy the conditions:
- `999 mod 1000 != 1`
- `998 mod 999 != 1`

Thus, the program is incorrect.
