To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can see that the variable `i` is the only one that can be adjusted directly by the loop construct. The variable `n` is a constant for the duration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1
- `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1
- `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500
- `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers
- `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]]`
- `i` is `i + 1`

We need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize the state adjustment as follows:

- `i` is incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]]`; `i` is `i + 1`** 

However, to be precise, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`. Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, if `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

Therefore, the final state can be written as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]]`; `i` is `i + 1`**

But to be more specific about the increment:

If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

So, if we assume `i` was `i_end` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]]`; `i` is `i + 1`**

But to be more specific:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]]`; `i` is `i_end + 1`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_end`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]]`; `i` is `i + 1`**

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]]`; `i` is `i + 1`**

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]]`; `i` is `i + 1`**
