The given code snippet reverses the list `a`. Before the reversal, `a` was defined as `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ..., (1000 - sum(T[:n-1]))]`. After reversing, the first element of the original list becomes the last element, the second element becomes the second-to-last, and so on.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `a`, which gets reversed. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`; `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[(1000 - sum(T[:n-1])), ..., (1000 - T[0]), 1000]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the new input string provided by the user; `i` is `n-1`.**
