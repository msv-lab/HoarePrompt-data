Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and the array, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n, `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of n integers representing the array. `bodya_score` is the result of `calculate_score(PB)` and `sasha_score` is the result of `calculate_score(PS)`. Additionally, `bodya_score` is equal to `sasha_score`**
