Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input where 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^6; `nabors` is an integer that must be greater than 1; `aa` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least `n` elements; `bb` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `bb`. `C[in_aa]` is 0.**
