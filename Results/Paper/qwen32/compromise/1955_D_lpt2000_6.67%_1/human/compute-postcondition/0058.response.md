Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^6; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `nabors` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `aa` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `bb` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference `cnt_aa - D` with the count of `out_aa` decremented by 1, and the count of `in_aa` incremented by 1; `C` is a Counter object representing the difference `cnt_bb - D` with `C[in_aa]` incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`; `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D`; `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` >= `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `in_aa` is `aa[m + i_in + 2]`; `out_aa` is `aa[i_out + 2]`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the count of `in_aa` in the Counter object `E` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and their states remain the same as described in the initial state.
