Output State: **`in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m + 1:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[1:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. The conditions and operations involving `out_aa`, `D[out_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, and `C[out_aa]` remain as described in the initial state, but `C[in_aa]` has been updated to be one more than its previous value.
