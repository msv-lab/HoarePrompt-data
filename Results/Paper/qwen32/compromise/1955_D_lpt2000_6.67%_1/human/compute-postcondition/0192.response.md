Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates how many times a sliding window of size `m` over list `a` contains at least `k` common elements with list `b`. The result for each test case is printed, indicating the count of such occurrences.**
