### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code in detail.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Encoding Process**:
  1. Construct a string `r` consisting of all distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
  2. Replace each character in `s` by its symmetric character from `r`.

- **Decoding Process**:
  1. Construct the string `r` from the encoded string `b` by identifying all distinct characters and sorting them.
  2. Create a mapping where each character in `r` (in its original order) maps to its symmetric character in `r` (reversed order).
  3. Use this mapping to transform the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code is as follows:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    b = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(b))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))
```

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - It first creates the string `r` by sorting and deduplicating the characters in the encoded string `b`.
  - It then creates a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
  - It uses this mapping to transform the encoded string `b` to the original string `s`.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary describes the function as creating a mapping where each character in `r` maps to its symmetric character in `r`. This is correct for the encoding process but needs to be reversed for decoding.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the provided program is incorrect because the mapping created in `func_1` is for encoding, not decoding. The correct mapping should map each character in the reversed `r` to its corresponding character in the original `r`.

#### Re-evaluation:
Let's verify the correctness of the provided code using the function summary and the problem description.

- The function `func_1` creates the string `r` correctly by sorting and deduplicating the characters in `b`.
- The mapping `{r[i]: r[-(i + 1)]}` is indeed the mapping used for encoding, not decoding. For decoding, the mapping should be reversed to `{r[-(i + 1)]: r[i]}`.

Thus, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly decode the string because the mapping is set up for encoding, not decoding.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
