Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split into two parts; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`. If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, and `i` is set to `n`.**
