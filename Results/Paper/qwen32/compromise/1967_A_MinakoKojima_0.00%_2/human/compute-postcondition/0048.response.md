Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` is updated to be the product of its current value and the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, with `i` still being 1 and `n` still being greater than 1.
