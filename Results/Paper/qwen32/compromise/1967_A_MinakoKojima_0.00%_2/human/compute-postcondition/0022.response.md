The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the implicit list `a` that is iterated over indirectly through the loop index `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value between 1 and `n-1` (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, and `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, it must be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is 0; `a` is a list of integers updated according to the loop; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Given the previous state where `i` was some value `x`, the new state at the start of the next iteration will have `i` as `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is 0; `a` is a list of integers updated according to the loop; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`; `i` is 4 (assuming the previous i was 3 for concreteness)**.

In general, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is 0; `a` is a list of integers updated according to the loop; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`; `i` is `x + 1`**.

Without a specific value for `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize the state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is 0; `a` is a list of integers updated according to the loop; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

For concreteness, if `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is 0; `a` is a list of integers updated according to the loop; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`; `i` is 4**.
