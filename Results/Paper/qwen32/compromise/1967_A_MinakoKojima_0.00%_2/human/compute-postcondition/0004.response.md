The code snippet provided simply initializes a variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are modified, and no calculations or conditions are applied. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `ans` with the value 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split into two parts; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0.**
