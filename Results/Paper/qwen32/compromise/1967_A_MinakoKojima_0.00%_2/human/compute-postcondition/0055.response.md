To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the logic of the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99.
2. `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split into two parts.
3. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
4. `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`.
5. If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, and `i` is set to `n`.

### Analysis of the Code Snippet:
The code snippet contains a `print(ans)` statement, where `ans` is determined based on the condition `k >= n * m`.

#### Case 1: `k >= n * m`
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`.
- `math.factorial(n)` is the factorial of `n`, which is the product of all positive integers up to `n`.

#### Case 2: `k < n * m`
- If `k` is less than `n * m`, `ans` is set to the product of the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`.
- This product is calculated by iterating through the list `a` and multiplying the differences between consecutive elements.

### Output Description:
Given the above conditions, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will depend on the values of `k`, `n`, `m`, and the elements of the list `a`.

- If `k >= n * m`, the output is the factorial of `n`.
- If `k < n * m`, the output is the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a`.

Since the exact values of `k`, `n`, `m`, and the list `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either the factorial of `n` or the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is either math.factorial(n) if k >= n * m, or the product of the differences a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[n-1] - a[n-2] if k < n * m)**
