Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move. Therefore, the possible number of cubes after `n` moves can be any integer value from `0` to `n` (inclusive). Specifically:
1. If `m > n`, it's impossible because the maximum number of cubes he can have is `n`. So, the answer should be "No".
2. If `m == n`, it's possible if he adds one cube each time. So, the answer should be "Yes".
3. If `m < n`, it's possible if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) does not change the number of cubes, and he can perform `n - m` additions or removals to reach `m` cubes. So, the answer should be "Yes" if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, otherwise "No".

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

- The program correctly handles the case when `b == c` by printing "YES".
- The condition `elif b < c` is incorrect. According to the problem, if `b < c`, it should print "NO" only if `c > b` (which is already covered in the previous condition). Instead, the program incorrectly prints "NO" whenever `b < c`, which is not correct because it should be "Yes" if `(c - b) % 2 == 0`.
- The condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2` is intended to check if `b - c` is even, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where `b > c`. It should check if `b - c` is even, which is equivalent to checking if `(b - c) % 2 == 0` or `(b % 2) == (c % 2)`. However, this condition alone is not sufficient because it does not account for the possibility where `b < c`.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct. The program is incorrect because:
- It does not handle the case where `b < c` correctly. It should print "Yes" if `(c - b) % 2 == 0`.
- The condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2` is not sufficient to determine the correct answer for all cases.

Thus, the final evaluation is:
Final: **False**
