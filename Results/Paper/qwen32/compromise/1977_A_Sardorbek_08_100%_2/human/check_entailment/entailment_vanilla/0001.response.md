Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move. Therefore, the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves can be any integer value between `-n` and `n` (inclusive), but since we cannot have a negative number of cubes, the actual range is from `0` to `n`.

For Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves:
1. If `m > n`, it's impossible because the maximum number of cubes he can have is `n`. So, the answer should be "No".
2. If `m == n`, it's possible if he adds one cube each time. So, the answer should be "Yes".
3. If `m < n`, it's possible if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) does not change the number of cubes, and he can perform `n - m` additions or removals to reach `m` cubes. So, the answer should be "Yes" if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, otherwise "No".

Now, let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

- The program correctly handles the case when `b == c` by printing "YES".
- However, the condition `elif b < c` is incorrect. According to the problem, if `b < c`, it should print "NO" only if `c > b` (which is already covered in the previous condition). Instead, the program incorrectly prints "NO" whenever `b < c`, which is not correct.
- The condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2` is intended to check if `b - c` is even, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where `b > c`. It should check if `b - c` is even, which is equivalent to checking if `(b - c) % 2 == 0` or `(b % 2) == (c % 2)`. However, this condition alone is not sufficient because it does not account for the possibility where `b < c`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the cases where `b < c` and does not properly check the parity condition for `b > c`.

Correctness: **False**
