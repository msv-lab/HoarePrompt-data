Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

# Annotated Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of sticks available, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: The output state consists of the integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of sticks available, and the list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks remain unchanged. The variable `ans` is still 0. The variable `cnt` is now a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that length appears in the list.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: t, n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, ans, cnt
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the value determined by the program's logic prior to the print statement)
