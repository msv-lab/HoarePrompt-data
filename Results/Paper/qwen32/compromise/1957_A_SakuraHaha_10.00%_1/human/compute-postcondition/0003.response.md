The code snippet provided initializes a dictionary `cnt`. This dictionary will be used to count occurrences of stick lengths in each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet. The variable `ans` also remains unchanged at 0.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of sticks available, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. `a` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks for the current test case. `ans` is 0. `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**
