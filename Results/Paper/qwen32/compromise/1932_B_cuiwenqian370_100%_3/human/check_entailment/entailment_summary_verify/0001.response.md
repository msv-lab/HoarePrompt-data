### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and verify its correctness using the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through this list to extract the number of test cases `T` and, for each test case, the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.
   - This part of the program is correctly implemented. It handles multiple test cases and extracts the necessary data.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates over the remaining signs (from the second to the `n`-th sign).
   - For each sign `i`, it calculates the year `next_year` in which this sign will occur using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
   - This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`. Let's break down this formula:
     - `last_year + 1` ensures that we start checking from the year immediately after the last sign occurred.
     - `a[i] - 1` ensures that we are considering the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year`.
     - `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i]` computes the integer division, which gives the quotient of the division of the sum by `a[i]`.
     - Multiplying by `a[i]` gives the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - After calculating `next_year`, it updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.
   - This logic correctly ensures that the signs occur sequentially.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it stores the results in a list and prints them, each on a new line.
   - The output is correctly formatted and matches the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs sequentially as required. The output for each test case is correctly computed and printed.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final: **True**
