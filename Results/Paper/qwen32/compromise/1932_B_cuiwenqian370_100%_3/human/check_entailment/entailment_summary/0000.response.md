### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicity of each sign. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works and whether it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then interprets the first value as the number of test cases (`T`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the list of their periodicities (`a`).

2. **Computation:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity (`a[0]`).
   - For each subsequent sign (from the second to the nth), it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur after the previous sign has occurred.
   - The calculation `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - It updates `last_year` with this new value and continues for all signs.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final year (`last_year`) to the results list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the first test case from the example:

- **Input:** `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Calculation:**
  - `last_year` starts as `3`.
  - For the second sign, `next_year` is calculated as `(3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`.
  - For the third sign, `next_year` is `(4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`.
  - For the fourth sign, `next_year` is `(8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`.
  - For the fifth sign, `next_year` is `(10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`.
  - For the sixth sign, `next_year` is `(18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`.
- **Output:** `36`

This matches the expected output for the first test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the given periodicities of each sign. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
