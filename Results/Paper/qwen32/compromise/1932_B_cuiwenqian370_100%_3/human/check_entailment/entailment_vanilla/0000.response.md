### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through this list to extract the number of test cases `T` and, for each test case, the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates over the remaining signs (from the second to the `n`-th sign).
   - For each sign `i`, it calculates the year `next_year` in which this sign will occur. This is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - After calculating `next_year`, it updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.
   
3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it stores the results in a list and prints them, each on a new line.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is strictly greater than the year the previous sign occurred. This ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required. The output for each test case is correctly computed and printed.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
