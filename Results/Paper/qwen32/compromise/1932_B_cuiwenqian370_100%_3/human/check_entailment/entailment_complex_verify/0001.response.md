### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its annotations to ensure it correctly implements the problem statement's logic.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid and efficient way to handle multiple test cases.
   - It then iterates through this list to extract the number of test cases `T` and, for each test case, the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`. This extraction is correctly implemented.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`. This is correct as the first sign will occur in the year `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates over the remaining signs (from the second to the `n`-th sign).
   - For each sign `i`, it calculates the year `next_year` in which this sign will occur using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`. Let's break down the formula:
     - `last_year + 1` ensures we start checking from the year immediately after `last_year`.
     - Adding `a[i] - 1` and then performing integer division by `a[i]` and multiplying by `a[i]` gives the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
     - This formula is correct for finding the next occurrence of the sign after `last_year`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it stores the results in a list and prints them, each on a new line. This is correctly implemented.

### Verification Using Annotations:

The annotations provided describe the state of the program at key points and confirm the logic. The final state of the program, as described in the annotations, is that `results` contains the correct year for each test case, and this is correctly printed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is strictly greater than the year the previous sign occurred. This ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required. The output for each test case is correctly computed and printed.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final: **True**
