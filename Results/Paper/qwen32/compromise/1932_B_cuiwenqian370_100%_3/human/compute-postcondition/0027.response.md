The code snippet `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `index` is `2 + n + 1 + n`, which simplifies to `2 + 2*n + 1` or `2*n + 3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2*n + 3`; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `last_year`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is the value obtained after the loop completes all iterations, calculated as `last_year = ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]` after the last iteration.**
