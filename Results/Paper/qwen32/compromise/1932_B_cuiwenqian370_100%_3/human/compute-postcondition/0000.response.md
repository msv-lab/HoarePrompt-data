The provided code snippet does not actually process or modify any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It only reads input from the standard input stream and assigns it to the variable `input`. However, this does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.**
