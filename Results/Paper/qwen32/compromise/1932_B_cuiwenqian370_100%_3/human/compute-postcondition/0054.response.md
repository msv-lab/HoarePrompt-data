The code snippet assigns the value of `next_year` to `last_year`. Since `next_year` is calculated as `(last_year + a[2]) // a[2] * a[2]`, after the assignment, `last_year` will have the same value as `next_year`.

Given that `next_year` is calculated based on the previous `last_year` and `a[2]`, and then `last_year` is updated to this new value, the `results` list will reflect this change. Specifically, the second element of `results` will be updated to the new `last_year` value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2*n + 4 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by the original `n`, then decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the string representation of the original `last_year`, and the second being the string representation of the updated `last_year` (which is equal to `next_year`); `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[2]) // a[2] * a[2]`; `i` is 2**
