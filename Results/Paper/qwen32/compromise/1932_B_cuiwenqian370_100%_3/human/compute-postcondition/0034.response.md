The code snippet `last_year = next_year` updates the value of `last_year` to be equal to `next_year`. 

Given the initial state, `last_year` was calculated as `(a[0] + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]` and `next_year` was calculated as `(a[0] + 2*a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`. After executing the code snippet, `last_year` now holds the value of `next_year`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2*n + 3`; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `last_year`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is `(a[0] + 2*a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`; `next_year` is `(a[0] + 2*a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`; `i` is 2.**
