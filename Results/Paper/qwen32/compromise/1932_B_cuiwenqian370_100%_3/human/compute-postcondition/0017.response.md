The value of `last_year` is updated to be equal to `next_year`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 2 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `a` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is the integer value of `data[index + i - 2]` for 1 <= i <= n; `last_year` is `((a[0] + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1] + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1]`; `next_year` is `((a[0] + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1] + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1]`; `i` is 1**.
