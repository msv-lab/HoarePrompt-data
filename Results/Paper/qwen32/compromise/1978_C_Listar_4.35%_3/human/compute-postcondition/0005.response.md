The code assigns the value returned by `func_1(n, k)` to the variable `l`. The values of `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, and `n` is not equal to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `n` is not equal to 0, `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`**.
