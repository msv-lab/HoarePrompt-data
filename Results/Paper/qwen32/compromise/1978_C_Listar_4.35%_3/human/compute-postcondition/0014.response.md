Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer) and `k` (a non-negative integer). It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds the maximum possible value for `k` based on `n`. If `k` is even and does not exceed the maximum possible value, it returns the tuple `(n, k)`.**
