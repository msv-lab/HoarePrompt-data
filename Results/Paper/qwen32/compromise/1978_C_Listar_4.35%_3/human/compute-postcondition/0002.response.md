Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
- The current value of `n` is 0.

The print statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
