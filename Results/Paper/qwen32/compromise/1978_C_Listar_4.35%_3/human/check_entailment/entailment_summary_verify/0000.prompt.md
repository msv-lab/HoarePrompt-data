You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if 1 + i > k:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(-k, x)
            return l
        k = k - i + 1
        x = l[-1]
        l.pop(-1)
        l.insert(0, x)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2:
        return (0, 0)
    if n % 2:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    if max_k < k:
        return (0, 0)
    return (n, k)

#Function 3:
def func_3(l):
    print('YES')
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    return

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, k) = func_2()
    if n == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` retrieves two values, `n` and `k`, from `func_2()`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns nothing. Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to get a list `l`, then calls `func_3(l)`, and finally returns nothing.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function incorrectly calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`). For a permutation of length `n`, the maximum Manhattan value is `n * (n - 1) / 2`, not `n**2 // 2` or `(n**2 - 1) // 2`.
   - The function returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds `max_k`. However, the problem statement does not require `k` to be even, and the maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` can indeed be an odd number.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function is supposed to generate a permutation with a specific Manhattan value `k`. However, the logic in `func_1` is incorrect and does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the desired Manhattan value.
   - The function modifies the list `l` by moving elements around based on the value of `k`, but the logic does not ensure that the final Manhattan value will match the input `k`.

3. **Function `func_4`**:
   - The function calls `func_2` to get `n` and `k`. If `n` is `0` (which should not happen based on the problem constraints), it prints "NO".
   - The function then calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_3` to print it. However, if `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it should print "NO" instead of attempting to generate a permutation.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the input:
```
1
3 3
```

The correct output should be:
```
Yes
3 1 2
```

However, the provided code will not generate this output correctly. The function `func_2` will incorrectly determine that `k` is too large because it uses an incorrect formula for `max_k`. Additionally, even if `k` is within the correct range, `func_1` will not generate the correct permutation.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle the problem constraints and logic, leading to incorrect outputs in many cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
