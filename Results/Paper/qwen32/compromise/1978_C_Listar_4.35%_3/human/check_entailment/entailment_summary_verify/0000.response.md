Let's carefully analyze the given problem description, the provided Python code, and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that its Manhattan value is equal to `k`. The Manhattan value of a permutation is defined as the sum of absolute differences between each element of the permutation and its index (1-based).

### Provided Code Analysis

#### Function `func_2`
- **Purpose**: To determine if a valid permutation exists for given `n` and `k`.
- **Logic**:
  - It first checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists.
  - It then calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`). For odd `n`, it uses `(n**2 - 1) // 2`, and for even `n`, it uses `n**2 // 2`.
  - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`.
  - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

#### Issues with `func_2`
- **Maximum Manhattan Value Calculation**:
  - The formula used for `max_k` is incorrect. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is indeed `n * (n - 1) / 2`, not `n**2 // 2` or `(n**2 - 1) // 2`. This is because each element can be at most `n - 1` positions away from its correct position.
- **Odd `k` Handling**:
  - The problem statement does not require `k` to be even. Therefore, checking if `k` is odd and returning `(0, 0)` is incorrect.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: To generate a permutation with the given Manhattan value `k`.
- **Logic**:
  - It starts with the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
  - It then modifies the permutation by moving elements around based on the value of `k`.
  
#### Issues with `func_1`
- **Logic Flaws**:
  - The logic in `func_1` is not well-defined and does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the desired Manhattan value. The approach of moving elements around based on `k` does not seem to follow a systematic method to achieve the exact Manhattan value.

#### Function `func_3`
- **Purpose**: To print the permutation.
- **Logic**:
  - It simply prints the permutation if it is valid.

#### Function `func_4`
- **Purpose**: To orchestrate the process of checking and generating the permutation.
- **Logic**:
  - It calls `func_2` to get `n` and `k`. If `n` is `0`, it prints "NO".
  - It then calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_3` to print it.

#### Issues with `func_4`
- **Handling of `func_2` Output**:
  - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it should print "NO" instead of attempting to generate a permutation.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the provided code has several issues:
1. The calculation of the maximum Manhattan value in `func_2` is incorrect.
2. The handling of odd `k` in `func_2` is incorrect.
3. The logic in `func_1` to generate the permutation with the exact Manhattan value is flawed.

Thus, the original assessment that the code is incorrect is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
