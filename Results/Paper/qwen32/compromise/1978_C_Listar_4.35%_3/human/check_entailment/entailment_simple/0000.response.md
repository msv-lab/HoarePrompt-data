### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated states of the program.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- **Purpose**: To validate the input values `n` and `k` and determine if a valid permutation can exist with the given Manhattan value `k`.
- **Logic**:
  - If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value for any permutation is always even.
  - It calculates `max_k` based on whether `n` is odd or even:
    - If `n` is odd, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`.
    - If `n` is even, `max_k = n^2 // 2`.
  - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)` because `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
  - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

#### Function `func_1(n, k)`:
- **Purpose**: To construct a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
- **Logic**:
  - It halves `k` because the operations it performs can only achieve even Manhattan values.
  - It initializes a list `l` as a permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
  - It iterates over the list in reverse order, adjusting elements to increase the Manhattan value by specific amounts until `k` becomes `0`.
  - The operations involve moving the last element of the list to a specific position to increase the Manhattan value by a calculated amount.

#### Function `func_3(l)`:
- **Purpose**: To print the permutation `l` if a valid one is found.
- **Logic**:
  - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` on the same line.

#### Function `func_4()`:
- **Purpose**: To tie everything together for each test case.
- **Logic**:
  - It calls `func_2()` to validate the input and get `n` and `k`.
  - If `n` is `0` (indicating invalid input), it prints "NO".
  - Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to get the permutation and `func_3(l)` to print it.

#### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the validation of `k` being even and within the possible range for the given `n`.
- The algorithm in `func_1()` seems to be designed to construct a permutation that achieves the desired Manhattan value by strategically moving elements.
- The functions are well-structured and correctly handle the input and output requirements as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It validates the inputs, constructs the permutation when possible, and outputs the result accordingly.

### Correctness: **True**
