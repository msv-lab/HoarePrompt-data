### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it adheres to the problem requirements and correctly handles all possible input cases. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Purpose:** Validates the inputs `n` and `k` and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`.
   - **Logic:**
     - If `k` is odd, it immediately returns `(0, 0)` since an odd Manhattan value cannot be achieved.
     - If `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` (calculated based on whether `n` is odd or even), it returns `(0, 0)`.
     - Otherwise, it returns the valid `(n, k)` pair.
   - **Correctness:** This function correctly handles the constraints and ensures that only valid permutations are considered.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Purpose:** Constructs a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k` (after `k` has been halved).
   - **Logic:**
     - The function starts with a list `l` containing integers from `1` to `n`.
     - It iterates from the end of the list towards the beginning, moving the last element to a specific position based on the value of `k`.
     - If `k` becomes `0`, it returns the current permutation.
     - The function ensures that the final permutation has the desired Manhattan value.
   - **Correctness:** The function is intended to generate a permutation with a specific Manhattan value, but it does not explicitly ensure that the final Manhattan value matches `k` exactly. The logic seems to be based on the assumption that halving `k` and rearranging the list will yield the correct result, but this is not thoroughly explained or proven.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - **Purpose:** Prints "YES" followed by the permutation.
   - **Logic:**
     - It prints "YES" and then the elements of the permutation list `l` separated by spaces.
   - **Correctness:** This function correctly formats the output as required.

4. **Function `func_4`:**
   - **Purpose:** Orchestrates the process by calling `func_2` to validate inputs, `func_1` to generate the permutation, and `func_3` to print the result.
   - **Logic:**
     - It first calls `func_2` to get the valid `(n, k)` pair.
     - If `n` is `0`, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_3` to print it.
   - **Correctness:** This function correctly handles the flow of the program, ensuring that only valid permutations are processed and printed.

### Conclusion:
The program's correctness hinges on the assumption that halving `k` and rearranging the list in `func_1` will yield a permutation with the exact Manhattan value `k`. However, the provided logic in `func_1` does not explicitly guarantee this. There is a potential gap in the logic that could lead to incorrect results for certain values of `n` and `k`.

**Correctness: False**
