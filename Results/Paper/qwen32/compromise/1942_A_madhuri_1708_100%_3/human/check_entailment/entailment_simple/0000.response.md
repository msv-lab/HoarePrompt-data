### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic for k < 2:**
   - When `k < 2`, the program outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - This is a valid solution because:
     - The only sorted cyclic shift of `[1, 2, ..., n]` is the array itself.
     - For `k = 1`, this satisfies the condition.
     - For `k = 0`, there is no sorted cyclic shift, and the problem does not specify this case, but the output `[1, 2, ..., n]` will not have any sorted cyclic shifts other than itself, which is not required.

3. **Logic for k >= 2:**
   - When `k >= 2` and `n == k`, the program outputs an array where all elements are `k`.
   - This is a valid solution because:
     - All cyclic shifts of `[k, k, ..., k]` (n times) are the same array, which is sorted.
     - Therefore, there are exactly `n` sorted cyclic shifts, which matches `k` if `n == k`.
   - When `k >= 2` and `n != k`, the program outputs `-1`.
   - This is a valid solution because:
     - It is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts where `k >= 2` and `n != k`.
     - If `n > k`, there are more positions to shift than the number of sorted shifts required, and it's not possible to have exactly `k` sorted shifts without violating the constraints.
     - If `n < k`, it's impossible to have more sorted shifts than the length of the array.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k = 1` and `k = 2` appropriately.
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^3`, so the program will run efficiently within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all specified cases and constraints. Thus, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
