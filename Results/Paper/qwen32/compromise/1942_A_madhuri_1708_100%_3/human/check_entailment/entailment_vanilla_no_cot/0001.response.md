Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires us to generate an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

### Analysis of the Provided Solution

#### Case 1: `k >= 2`
- If `k == n`, the program outputs an array where all elements are equal to `k`. This is correct because all cyclic shifts of an array with identical elements are sorted.
- If `k < n`, the program outputs `-1`. This is correct because it is impossible to have exactly `k` cyclic shifts sorted when `k < n` and `k >= 2`. If `k` cyclic shifts are sorted, it implies that there is a segment of the array that is sorted and can be shifted into `k` positions, which is not possible for `k < n` without making more than `k` cyclic shifts sorted.

#### Case 2: `k == 1`
- The program outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This is incorrect because it will always have more than one sorted cyclic shift. The only way to have exactly one sorted cyclic shift is to carefully design an array where only one specific cyclic shift is sorted, and all others are not.

### Conclusion
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k == 1` properly. It outputs an array that will always have more than one sorted cyclic shift, which contradicts the problem requirements.

### Correctness
Correctness: **False**

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem for `k == 1`, we need to construct an array where only one cyclic shift is sorted. One possible approach is to create an array where the elements are in increasing order except for the last element, which is smaller than the first element. This way, only the cyclic shift starting with the smallest element will be sorted.

For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 1`, a valid array could be `[2, 3, 1]`. Its cyclic shifts are:
- `[2, 3, 1]` (not sorted)
- `[3, 1, 2]` (not sorted)
- `[1, 2, 3]` (sorted)

This satisfies the condition of having exactly one sorted cyclic shift.
