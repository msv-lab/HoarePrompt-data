### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating through certain values of `count` and calculating `ans` based on some conditions. However, the logic of the code does not align with the problem requirements.

Here is the code for reference:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Issues in the Code
1. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is incorrect. This implies that every pair \((a, 1)\) is counted initially, but this is not necessarily true based on the problem's conditions.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates from `count = 2` to `m`, but the logic inside the loop is not correctly derived from the problem statement. Specifically, the conditions and calculations inside the loop do not correctly determine the number of valid pairs.

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `if g < countmins` is not logically derived from the problem statement. Similarly, the subsequent calculations `g -= countmins` and `ans += g / count + 1` do not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Output**:
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, but it is not correctly computed based on the problem's conditions.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, due to the constraints (\(n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)), a brute-force approach is inefficient. Instead, we need to use mathematical insights or optimizations.

The provided code does not implement such an approach and contains logical errors.

#### Function Summary
The function summary states that the function processes `t` test cases and calculates a specific integer value based on the given `n` and `m`, but it does not specify the correctness of the calculations. Given the analysis above, the function summary does not validate the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It contains logical errors in the initialization and the loop conditions, and the final output is not correctly computed.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
