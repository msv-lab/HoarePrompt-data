Let's analyze the impact of the code snippet on the given initial state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` must be at least 4
- `count` is 3
- `ans` is `n + n / 2 + 1`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `countmins` is 2
- `g` is `n / 3 - 2`

Code Snippet:
```
ans += g / count + 1
```

The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding `g / count + 1` to it. Let's calculate the new value of `ans` based on the initial state.

The initial value of `ans` is `n + n / 2 + 1`. The value to be added to `ans` is `g / count + 1`. Since `g` is `n / 3 - 2` and `count` is 3, we can substitute these values in:

`g / count + 1` = `(n / 3 - 2) / 3 + 1` = `n / 9 - 2 / 3 + 1` = `n / 9 + 1 / 3`

So, the new value of `ans` will be:

`ans` = `n + n / 2 + 1 + n / 9 + 1 / 3`

Let's simplify this expression:

`ans` = `n + n / 2 + n / 9 + 1 + 1 / 3`

`ans` = `n + (9n + 18n + 2n) / 18 + 1 + 1 / 3`

`ans` = `n + 29n / 18 + 1 + 1 / 3`

`ans` = `(18n + 29n) / 18 + 1 + 1 / 3`

`ans` = `47n / 18 + 1 + 1 / 3`

`ans` = `47n / 18 + 4 / 3`

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `47n / 18 + 4 / 3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` must be at least 4; `count` is 3; `ans` is `47n / 18 + 4 / 3`; `i` is `i + 1`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3 - 2`.**
