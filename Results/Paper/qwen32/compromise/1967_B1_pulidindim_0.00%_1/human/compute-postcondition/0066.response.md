The code snippet assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. Therefore, the value of `ans` is now equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `count` is 2; `ans` is equal to `n`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
