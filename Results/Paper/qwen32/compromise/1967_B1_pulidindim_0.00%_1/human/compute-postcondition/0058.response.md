The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`. Initially, `g` is `n / 3` and `countmins` is 2. Therefore, after the operation, `g` becomes `n / 3 - 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + n / 4 + n / 9 + 1.5 - 2/3`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3 - 2`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, otherwise the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
