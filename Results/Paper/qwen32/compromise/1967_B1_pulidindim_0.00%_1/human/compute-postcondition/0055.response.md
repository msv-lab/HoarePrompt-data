The value of `g` is updated to be `n / count`. Given the initial state, `count` is 3, so `g` becomes `n / 3`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + n / 4 + n / 9 + 1.5 - 2/3`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + n / 4 + n / 9 + 1.5 - 2/3`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3`.**
