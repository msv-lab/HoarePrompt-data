The code snippet `g = n / count` updates the value of `g` to be the result of `n` divided by `count`. Given the initial state, `count` is 2, so `g` becomes `n / 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is equal to `n + g / count + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2`.**
