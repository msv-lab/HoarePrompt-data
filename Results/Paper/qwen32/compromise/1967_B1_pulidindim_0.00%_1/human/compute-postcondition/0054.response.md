Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + n / 4 + n / 9 + 1.5 - 2/3`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3 - 2`; `countmins` is now 2.**

Explanation: The value of `countmins` is updated to `count - 1`, which means `countmins` is now `3 - 1 = 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
