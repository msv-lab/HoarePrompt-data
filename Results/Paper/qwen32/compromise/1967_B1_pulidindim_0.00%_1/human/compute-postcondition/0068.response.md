The variable `countmins` is assigned the value of `count - 1`. Given that `count` is initially 2, `countmins` will be `2 - 1`, which equals 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is equal to `n`; `i` is `i + 1`; `countmins` is 1**.
