Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `m` is greater than 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - countmins) / 2 + 1`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
