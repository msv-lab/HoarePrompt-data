### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on its substrings. Let's break down the logic and correctness of the program.

#### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s should be before all 1s).
   - The cost of cyclically shifting a substring is equal to the length of that substring.
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve the sorted order.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string.
   - It counts the number of 1s encountered (`n`).
   - When a 0 is encountered after some 1s, it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`).

3. **Explanation of the Cost Calculation**:
   - The logic behind `ans += n + 1` is that each 0 encountered after some 1s means that all these 1s need to be shifted to the right to make the string sorted. The cost for this operation is the number of 1s (`n`) plus the cost of shifting the 0 itself (which is 1).
   - However, this logic does not correctly account for the minimal cost required to sort the string. It overestimates the cost because it doesn't consider the optimal way to perform the cyclic shifts.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - Let's verify the first test case: `10`.
     - The program will count `n = 1` for the first character `1`.
     - When it encounters `0`, it will add `n + 1 = 2` to `ans`.
     - The correct cost is indeed 2, as shifting the entire string `10` to `01` costs 2.
   - However, let's consider the third test case: `11000`.
     - The program will add `2 + 1 = 3` when it encounters the first `0`, then `2 + 1 = 3` for the second `0`, and `1 + 1 = 2` for the third `0`.
     - This results in a total cost of `3 + 3 + 2 = 8`, but the correct minimal cost is 9 (as per the problem statement).
   - The program fails to minimize the cost correctly, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order. The logic for calculating the cost is flawed and overestimates the minimal cost required.

**Correctness: False**
