Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

Here are the issues with the code:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is expecting a list of integers separated by spaces, which is not the format of the input as described in the problem. The input is a binary string, not a list of integers.
   
2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic used in `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The approach seems to be based on counting the number of '1's and '0's but does not account for the optimal cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine how many '1's are before each '0' and calculate the cost based on that. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    cost = 0
    ones_count = 0
    
    for char in s:
        if char == '1':
            ones_count += 1
        elif char == '0' and ones_count > 0:
            cost += ones_count
    
    return cost

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        print(min_cost_to_sort(s))

main()
```

This corrected program reads the input correctly, counts the number of '1's before each '0', and calculates the minimum cost to sort the string as required by the problem statement.
