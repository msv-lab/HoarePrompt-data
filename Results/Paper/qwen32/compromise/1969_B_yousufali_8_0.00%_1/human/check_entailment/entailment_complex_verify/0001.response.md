### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a critical issue with the input parsing in `func_1()`. The program reads the input using `input().split()`, which would split the input string by spaces, treating each character as a separate element if there were spaces. However, the problem specifies that the input is a single binary string without spaces. Therefore, the correct approach is to read the input as a single string and process it accordingly.

Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The original `func_1()` reads the input using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for this problem.
   - The correct way to read the input is `input().strip()`, which reads the entire line as a single string without leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - The logic for calculating the cost to move each 1 to the end of the string is correct. The program counts the number of 1s encountered (`n`) and adds `n + 1` to the accumulated cost (`ans`) whenever a 0 is encountered after at least one 1.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points but do not address the input parsing issue.
   - The annotations confirm that the logic for calculating the cost is correct, but they do not highlight the critical input parsing error.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of `func_1()` with proper input parsing:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()  # Read the binary string
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':  # Check if the character is '1'
            n += 1
        elif n != 0:  # If the character is '0' and there are preceding '1's
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incorrect due to the improper input parsing in `func_1()`. The logic for calculating the cost is correct if the input is read and processed properly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect as it does not correctly parse the input, leading to potential errors in processing the binary strings.
