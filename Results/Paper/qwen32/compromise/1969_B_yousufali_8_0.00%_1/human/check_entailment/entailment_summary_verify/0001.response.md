### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical issue with the input parsing in `func_1()`. The function `func_1()` reads the input using `input().split()`, which splits the input based on whitespace and converts each element to an integer. However, the problem specifies that the input is a single binary string without spaces, so this method of input reading is incorrect.

The function summary for `func_2()` is accurate in stating that it reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1()`. However, since `func_1()` does not correctly parse the binary string input, `func_2()` will also not function as intended.

The logic for calculating the cost in `func_1()` is correct based on the problem description and the intended behavior. The function correctly counts the number of 1s encountered and calculates the cost to move each 1 to the end of the string after encountering a 0. This logic aligns with the problem's requirements.

However, due to the incorrect input parsing, the program will not produce the correct results for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
