### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
- The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
- We need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` reads the input using `input().split()`. This is incorrect because the problem specifies a binary string without spaces. The correct way to read a binary string would be `input().strip()`.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - The current logic in `func_1()` involves iterating through the string and counting the number of '1's. It then calculates a cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's.
   - The provided logic does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. It appears to be based on a flawed assumption about how to calculate the cost.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_1()`:
- The code counts the number of '1's encountered so far (`n`).
- When a '0' is encountered and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to the cost (`ans`).
- This logic does not align with the problem's requirement to perform cyclic shifts and calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.

#### Example Validation:
Let's consider the test case from the problem statement:
```
1
101011
```
- The correct minimum cost to sort the string is 5.
- The provided code's logic would not produce this result. Instead, it would likely produce an incorrect cost due to the flawed logic.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The input handling is incorrect, and the logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
