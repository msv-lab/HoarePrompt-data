You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program is designed to output a 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern with 2x2 squares alternating between '#' and '.', starting with '#' in the top-left corner. The program handles the cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 explicitly by printing the corresponding patterns. However, for n > 4, the program outputs "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in range" in Spanish), which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The problem statement specifies that the input n will be between 1 and 20, inclusive, and the program should handle all values within this range correctly.

The program does not dynamically generate the checkerboard pattern for values of n greater than 4, which is a requirement of the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect for n > 4.

Correctness: **False**
