Reasoning: 
The provided program is designed to handle test cases where `n` is between 1 and 4 inclusive. For each of these values, the program correctly prints the corresponding 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern as described in the problem statement. However, the program does not handle values of `n` greater than 4, and instead prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish). Since the problem statement specifies that `n` can be as large as 20, the program is not complete and does not meet the requirements for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
