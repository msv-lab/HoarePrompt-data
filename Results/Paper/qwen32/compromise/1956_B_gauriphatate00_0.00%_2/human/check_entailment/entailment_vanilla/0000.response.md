To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether the program accurately computes the maximum number of points you can get if you play optimally, given Nene's optimal strategy.

### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - You and Nene each have `n` cards, with each card having a number from 1 to `n` and each number appearing exactly twice in the deck.
   - You take turns placing cards on the table, and you get a point if the number on the card you place is already on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize your points.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - For a given card number that appears twice, you can only get a point if you place the second card of that number after Nene has placed the first one.
   - Since Nene is playing optimally, she will try to place cards in such a way that she maximizes her points and minimizes yours.
   - The maximum number of points you can get is limited by the number of card pairs you have and the number of turns you have (which is `n`).

3. **Counting Pairs:**
   - The number of pairs in your hand is the number of card numbers that appear exactly twice.
   - Since you and Nene each have `n` turns, the maximum number of points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and `n // 2`. This is because you can only get a point for each pair, and you have `n` turns, so you can only get at most `n // 2` points.

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of pairs in your hand using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
   - It then returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which matches the logic described above.
   - The `func_2` function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results, which is the correct way to handle multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given Nene's optimal strategy. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
