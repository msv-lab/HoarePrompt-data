### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided solution and the problem statement to ensure that the program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Setup:**
   - There are `2n` cards, with each integer from 1 to `n` appearing exactly twice.
   - You and Nene each receive `n` cards.
   - The game consists of `2n` turns, with each player taking `n` turns.
   - You score a point if you place a card on the table that already has a matching card.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - You want to maximize your points.
   - Nene wants to maximize her points and, in case of a tie, minimize your points.

#### Solution Analysis:
1. **Counting Pairs:**
   - The function `func_1(n, a)` uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - It calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) in your hand, i.e., the number of integers that appear exactly twice.
   - The maximum number of points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs in your hand and `n // 2`. This is because you can only get a point if you place a card that already has a matching card on the table, and there are only `n` turns for you to place cards.

2. **Reading Input and Processing Test Cases:**
   - The function `func_2()` reads the input, which consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - It computes the result for each test case using `func_1(n, a)` and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

#### Verification:
- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The logic in `func_1` is sound. The number of points you can get is determined by the number of pairs you have, but you can only place cards for `n` turns. Therefore, the maximum points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.
  
- **Handling Input:**
  - `func_2` correctly reads and processes multiple test cases. It uses the `Counter` from `collections` to count pairs and calculates the result for each test case.

#### Example Verification:
- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `a = [1, 1, 2, 3]`
  - Pairs: `1` appears twice.
  - Maximum points: `min(1, 4 // 2) = 1`
  - Output: `1` (correct)

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `n = 8`, `a = [7, 4, 1, 2, 8, 8, 5, 5]`
  - Pairs: `8` appears twice, `5` appears twice.
  - Maximum points: `min(2, 8 // 2) = 2`
  - Output: `2` (correct)

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `n = 8`, `a = [7, 1, 4, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6]`
  - Pairs: `4` appears twice.
  - Maximum points: `min(1, 8 // 2) = 1`
  - Output: `1` (correct)

- **Fourth Test Case:**
  - Input: `n = 3`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`
  - Pairs: No pairs.
  - Maximum points: `min(0, 3 // 2) = 0`
  - Output: `0` (correct)

- **Fifth Test Case:**
  - Input: `n = 1`, `a = [1]`
  - Pairs: No pairs.
  - Maximum points: `min(0, 1 // 2) = 0`
  - Output: `0` (correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, given the constraints and the behavior of Nene. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
