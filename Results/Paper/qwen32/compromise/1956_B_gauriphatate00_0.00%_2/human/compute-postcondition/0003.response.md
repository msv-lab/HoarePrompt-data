The code snippet converts the string at index `idx` of the `data` list to an integer and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, `a`, `input`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `idx` is 0, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
