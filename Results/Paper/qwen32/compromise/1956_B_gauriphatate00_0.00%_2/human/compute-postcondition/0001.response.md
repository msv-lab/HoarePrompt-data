The code snippet reads a line of input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method. This operation does not change the initial state of `n` or `a` but assigns the split input to a new variable `data`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
