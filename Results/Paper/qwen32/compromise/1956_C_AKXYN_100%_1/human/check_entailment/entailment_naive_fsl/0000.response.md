Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix and the operations required to achieve that sum. The logic for calculating the sum and the operations does not align with the problem description.

Here are the issues:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   The program calculates the sum using the formula:
   ```python
   res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
   ```
   This formula does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, when filled optimally by the operations, is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times, i.e., \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Operations:**
   The operations printed by the program are:
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
       print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   These operations do not ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum. The operations should be designed such that each cell in the matrix is assigned the highest possible value, which can be achieved by filling each row and column with a permutation that maximizes the sum.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

For \( n = 2 \):
- The maximum sum should be \( 2 \times \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 6 \).
- The matrix should look like:
  ```
  1 2
  2 1
  ```
- The operations to achieve this could be:
  ```
  1 1 1 2
  2 2 2 1
  ```

The provided program does not generate the correct operations or sum for this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
