Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix by performing a series of operations. Each operation can either assign a permutation to a row or a column. We need to ensure that the sum of all elements in the matrix is maximized and that the number of operations does not exceed \( 2n \).

### Correct Approach

1. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix can be achieved by filling each cell with the highest possible value. The optimal strategy is to fill each row and column with a permutation that maximizes the sum.
   - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). Since we have \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, the maximum possible sum of the matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Operations:**
   - To achieve this maximum sum, we can perform operations that assign permutations to each row and column in a way that each cell gets the highest possible value.
   - One way to do this is to fill each row with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) and then fill each column with the same permutation. This ensures that each cell in the matrix gets a unique value from 1 to \( n \).

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

#### Annotations and Issues

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula:
     ```python
     res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
     ```
   - This formula does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct maximum sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Operations:**
   - The operations printed by the program are:
     ```python
     for i in range(n, 0, -1):
         print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
         print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
   - These operations do not ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum. The operations should be designed such that each cell in the matrix is assigned the highest possible value, which can be achieved by filling each row and column with a permutation that maximizes the sum.

### Correct Sum Calculation

The correct sum for the matrix can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Sum} = n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

### Correct Operations

To achieve the maximum sum, we can perform the following operations:
- For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), assign the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
- For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), assign the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

However, the provided program does not correctly calculate the sum and does not generate the correct operations. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix and does not generate the correct operations to achieve that sum.
