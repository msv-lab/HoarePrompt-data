Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix or generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve that sum. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Maximum Sum**:
   - The current program calculates the sum using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is incorrect for the problem's objective.
   - The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with distinct values from 1 to n in each row and column, ensuring that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and column. This essentially means filling the matrix with a Latin square, which for the purpose of maximizing the sum would be a matrix filled with the maximum possible values, i.e., the numbers 1 through n in a way that maximizes the sum.

2. **Incorrect Operations**:
   - The operations described in the output do not guarantee that the matrix will be filled in a way that maximizes the sum.
   - The operations provided will not necessarily result in the maximum possible sum, as they do not ensure that each row and column contains a permutation that maximizes the overall sum.

To achieve the maximum sum, the program should fill the matrix with a Latin square pattern and output the operations that achieve this pattern. Given the constraints, a simple and correct approach would be to fill the matrix with the identity matrix (or any permutation matrix) and then output the operations that achieve this filling.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        # The maximum sum is simply the sum of the first n natural numbers, repeated n times
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(max_sum, n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # For each row i, perform a type 1 operation with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]
            print(f"1 {i} {' '.join(map(str, range(1, n + 1)))}")

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs the operations needed to achieve this sum. Each row is filled with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n], which is a valid operation and ensures that the sum is maximized.
