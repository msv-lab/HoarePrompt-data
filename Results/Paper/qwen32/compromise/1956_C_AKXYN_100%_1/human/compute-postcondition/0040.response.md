The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n` down to `1` with a step of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-2`, meaning the loop has just finished executing with `i` equal to `n-2`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be decremented by `1` to `n-3`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`res` is 110, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be at least 1, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n-3`**
