Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an `n Ã— n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates a specific value `res` and prints this value along with `n << 1`. It then prints a series of commands that describe operations on the matrix, effectively simulating filling the matrix in a specific pattern twice for each row from `n` down to `1`.**
