The code snippet creates a new matrix `mat` with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`. This overwrites the previous value of `mat`. The values of `res`, `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is 110, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is the new input integer, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 0**.
