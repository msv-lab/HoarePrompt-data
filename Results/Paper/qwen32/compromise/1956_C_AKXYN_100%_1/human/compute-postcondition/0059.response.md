The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the range parameters (which are `n`, `0`, and `-1` in this case). According to the code, the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration and continues as long as `i` is greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, so `i` should be `n-2`.

The values of `res`, `t`, `n`, and `mat` do not affect the continuation of the loop, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`res` is 110, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n-2`**
