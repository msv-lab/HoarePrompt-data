The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n` down to 1, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be decremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted as it is the upper limit of the range and is not modified within the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 1**
