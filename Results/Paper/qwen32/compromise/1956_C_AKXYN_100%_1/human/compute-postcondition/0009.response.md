The value of `res` is updated by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Initially, `res` is `2 * (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. After the operation, `res` becomes `2 * (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) + (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which simplifies to `3 * (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `mat` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `3 * (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`**
