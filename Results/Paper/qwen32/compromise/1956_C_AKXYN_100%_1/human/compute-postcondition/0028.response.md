The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 2, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 6, `i` is 2**
