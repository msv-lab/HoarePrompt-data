The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, and `n` must be at least 1. 

Since the loop is decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration (`range(n, 0, -1)`), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 from its current value (`n-1`).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n-2`.

State: **`res` is 110, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be at least 1, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n-2`**
