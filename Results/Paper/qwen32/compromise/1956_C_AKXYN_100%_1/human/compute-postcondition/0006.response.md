The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be increased by 1 so that the loop can potentially execute again.

Given that `res` is calculated as `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, this value is dependent on `i`, but since `res` is not part of the loop head, we do not need to adjust it. The state of `t`, `n`, and `mat` also does not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`**
