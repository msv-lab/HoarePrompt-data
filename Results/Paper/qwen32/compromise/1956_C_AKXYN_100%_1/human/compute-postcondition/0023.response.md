`n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `t`, `mat`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is the input integer, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is the input integer, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 1.**
