Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `nums` is a list of integers \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
