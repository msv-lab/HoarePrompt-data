The code appends a new value to the list `nums`. The new value is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`, where `idx` is 26. Given that `nums[idx]` corresponds to `nums[26]`, which is `k + 1`, the new value to be appended is `k + (k + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `2k + 2`.

The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged. The list `nums` now has an additional element at the end, which is `2k + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 8388608, k + 1, 2k + 2]\), `idx` is 26.**
