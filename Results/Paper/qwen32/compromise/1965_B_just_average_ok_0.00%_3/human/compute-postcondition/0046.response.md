To determine the final state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided information. The loop increments `idx` by 1 each time `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to \(2^{\text{idx}}\)).

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After 1 iteration, `k` must be at least 1, and `idx` becomes 1.
- After 2 iterations, `k` must be at least 2, and `idx` becomes 2.
- After 3 iterations, `k` must be at least 4, and `idx` becomes 3.

From this pattern, we can deduce that the loop will continue to increment `idx` until `k` is less than \(2^{\text{idx}}\). Therefore, the final value of `idx` will be the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}}\).

Let's denote the final value of `idx` as \( \text{final\_idx} \). The loop will terminate when \( k < 2^{\text{final\_idx}} \), meaning \( \text{final\_idx} \) is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{final\_idx}} \).

For example, if \( k = 7 \):
- After 1 iteration, \( k \geq 2^1 \) (True, since \( 7 \geq 2 \)), so `idx` becomes 1.
- After 2 iterations, \( k \geq 2^2 \) (True, since \( 7 \geq 4 \)), so `idx` becomes 2.
- After 3 iterations, \( k \geq 2^3 \) (False, since \( 7 < 8 \)), so the loop terminates with `idx` being 3.

Thus, the final state of `idx` is determined by the smallest power of 2 that is greater than `k`.

Given the pattern and the nature of the loop, the final state will be:
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `k` remains the second integer from the input.
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `nums` remains \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).
- `idx` will be the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \).

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \).**
