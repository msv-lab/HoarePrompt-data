The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `input()` will return the string representation of `t`. However, the provided code does not use `t` directly and instead reads new values for `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**
