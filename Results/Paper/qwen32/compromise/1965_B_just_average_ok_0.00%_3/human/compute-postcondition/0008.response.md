To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop condition: `k` and `idx`.

The loop condition is:
```
while k >= 1 << idx:
```
This means the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `2^idx`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the first integer from the input (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `k` must be at least 2.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `nums` is a predefined list of integers (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `idx` is 2.

At the end of the previous iteration, `idx` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << 2` (which is 4).

Since `k` must be at least 2 initially, we need to ensure that `k` is adjusted to be at least 4 to satisfy the condition `k >= 1 << idx` with `idx` being 2.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be at least 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `nums` is a list of integers \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 2**
