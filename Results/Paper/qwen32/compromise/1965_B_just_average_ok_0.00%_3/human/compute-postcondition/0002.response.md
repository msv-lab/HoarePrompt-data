The code snippet creates a list `nums` containing 24 elements, where each element is a power of 2, specifically \(2^i\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to 23. The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged by this code.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `nums` is a list of integers \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).**
