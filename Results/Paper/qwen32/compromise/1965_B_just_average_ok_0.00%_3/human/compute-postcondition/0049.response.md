The code snippet appends `k + 1` to the `nums` list. The initial state specifies that `nums` already contains a series of powers of 2 up to `2^{idx}` where `idx` is determined by the condition `k < 2^idx`. After appending `k + 1` to `nums`, the list `nums` will include this new value as its last element.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `k`, `t`, and the condition determining `idx` remain unchanged. The only change is that `nums` now includes an additional element, `k + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - nums[idx], k + 1]\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.**
