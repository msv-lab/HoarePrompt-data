The code snippet provided decrements the value of `idx` by 1. Given that `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \), after decrementing `idx`, it will no longer satisfy this condition. However, since the problem statement asks for the output state, we will simply reflect the change in `idx`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.**
