The code sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 is still valid. The precondition that `arr` is a list of integers of length `n` where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 is also still valid, but the order of the elements in `arr` has been modified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of integers of length `n` where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.**
