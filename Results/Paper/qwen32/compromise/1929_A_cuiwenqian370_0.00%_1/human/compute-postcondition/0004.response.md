To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `left <= right`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers of length `n` where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9
- `new_arr` is an empty list
- `left` is 0
- `right` is `n - 1`

We need to ensure that the condition `left <= right` is true for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Condition**: The loop condition involves `left` and `right`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `left` is initialized to 0.
   - `right` is initialized to `n - 1`.
3. **Condition Check**:
   - For the loop to execute, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.
   - Since `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`, and `n` is at least 2, `right` will be at least 1. Therefore, `left` (which is 0) will always be less than or equal to `right` (which is at least 1).

### Conclusion:
Given that `n` is at least 2, the initial values of `left` and `right` ensure that the condition `left <= right` is always true. No adjustments are needed to the initial state for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers of length `n` where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is `n - 1`**
