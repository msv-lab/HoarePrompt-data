Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers of length `n` where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is set to `n - 1`, while the values of `n`, `arr`, `new_arr`, and `left` remain unchanged.
