### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their digits.
- The operations can be performed any number of times.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Operation Implementation**:
   - The program iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if it is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - The splitting logic is correct for two-digit numbers (`a // 10` and `a % 10`).

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to check if the array is sorted after attempting the operations.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` checks if the input list `lst` is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.
- The summary states that `func_1` returns `True` regardless of the input values, which is **incorrect**. The function actually checks if the list is sorted and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

### Issues in the Program:
- The main issue is the logic for splitting and reinserting digits. The program only checks adjacent elements and performs a single pass through the array. This approach does not guarantee that the array will be sorted after the operations.
- The program does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed or where splits affect the order of elements further down the list.
- The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted, but the overall logic of the program is flawed.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not guaranteed to correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
