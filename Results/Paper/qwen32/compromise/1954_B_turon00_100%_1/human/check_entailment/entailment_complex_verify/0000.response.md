### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all elements the same by repeatedly applying the specified operation.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve this problem by finding the shortest contiguous subarray of the same elements and then using that to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count the length of contiguous subarrays of `tmp`.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n` to store the minimum length of such subarrays.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element in the array, if it matches `tmp`, increment `cnt`.
   - If it does not match, update `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and reset `cnt` to 0.

3. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, update `ans` one last time to account for the last contiguous subarray.

4. **Output**:
   - If `n == 1` or `ans == n` (meaning all elements are the same), print `-1`.
   - Otherwise, print `ans`.

#### Evaluation using Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- `tmp` is the first element of the array.
- `cnt` counts the length of contiguous subarrays of `tmp`.
- `ans` is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray of `tmp`.
- If `n == 1` or `ans == n`, the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so the output is `-1`.
- Otherwise, the output is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray of `tmp`.

#### Counterexample Analysis:
The original assessment provides a counterexample:
- **Input**: `1 7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
- **Expected Output**: `3`
- **Actual Output**: `-1`

The provided code incorrectly determines that the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements because it only checks the length of contiguous subarrays of the first element, not the overall structure of the array.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the longest contiguous subarray of the same elements and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of the beautiful array. The provided code does not handle this correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove for the array to stop being beautiful. It only checks the length of contiguous subarrays of the first element, which is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
