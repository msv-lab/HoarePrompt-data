Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program attempts to find the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements and then calculates the minimum number of elements to remove based on this subarray. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of removing elements that are not part of the longest contiguous subarray but are necessary to break the beautiful property of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the entire array and identify the minimum number of removals required to disrupt the beautiful property. This involves checking for the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements and considering other potential disruptions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements
        max_len = 1
        current_len = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == a[i-1]:
                current_len += 1
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
                current_len = 1
        max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
        
        # If the longest contiguous subarray is the entire array, return -1
        if max_len == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of removals
            print(n - max_len)

func()
```

This corrected version finds the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements and calculates the minimum number of removals required to break the beautiful property of the array. If the longest contiguous subarray is the entire array, it returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful.
