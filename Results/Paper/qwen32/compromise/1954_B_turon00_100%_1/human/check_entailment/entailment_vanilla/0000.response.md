Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all identical elements by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).

### Key Points

1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: An array is beautiful if, for any index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)), if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \), you can replace \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \). This operation can be performed any number of times.

2. **Objective**: Determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. If it's impossible to do so, return -1.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The array is already beautiful.
   - The sum of all \( n \) (lengths of arrays across all test cases) does not exceed \( 3 \cdot 10^5 \).

### Program Analysis

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case, reading the array, and then trying to find the minimum number of elements to remove. Here's how the code works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `tmp` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `cnt` is initialized to count occurrences of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - `ans` is initialized to the length of the array, representing the worst-case scenario where the entire array needs to be removed.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The code iterates through the array.
   - If the current element matches `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
   - If the current element does not match `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` and resets `cnt` to 1 (since the current element starts a new sequence).

3. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `ans` to consider the last sequence of identical elements.

4. **Decision**:
   - If the array length is 1 or `ans` equals the array length, it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements).
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

### Issues in the Program

The provided program has a fundamental flaw in its logic. The approach of counting sequences of identical elements and finding the minimum sequence length does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify the longest sequence of identical elements.
2. If the entire array is a single sequence, return `-1` (impossible to make it non-beautiful).
3. Otherwise, the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest sequence minus 1 (since removing all but one of the longest sequence will ensure the array is no longer beautiful).

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
