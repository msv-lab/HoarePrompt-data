Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that `n` ≥ 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 3 and `ans` is `n` if `i` is the first index where `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `min(n, 2)`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0; `i` is 2.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering both possible conditions of the if statement.
