The code snippet provided sets the variable `cnt` to 0. The other variables (`n`, `a[i]`, `tmp`, `ans`) are not affected by this assignment. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt` remains valid, except that `cnt` is now explicitly set to 0.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of its current value and 0, `cnt` is 0.**
