The value of `cnt` is reset to 0. The other variables (`n`, `a[i]`, `tmp`, and `ans`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt` (which is now 0), and `cnt` is 0.
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and 0, `cnt` is 0**.
