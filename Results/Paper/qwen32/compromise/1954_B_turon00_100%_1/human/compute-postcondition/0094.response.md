Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within `a` that contains only the first element of `a`. If all elements in `a` are the same or if `n` is 1, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the length of the shortest such subarray.**
