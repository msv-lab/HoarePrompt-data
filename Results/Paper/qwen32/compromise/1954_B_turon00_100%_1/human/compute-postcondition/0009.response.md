The code snippet increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an input integer such that `n` ≥ 1, `a` remains a list of `n` integers read from the input, `tmp` remains equal to `a[0]`, and `ans` remains equal to `n`. The current element `a[i]` remains equal to `tmp`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that `n` ≥ 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`; `cnt` is 1; `ans` is `n`; the current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**
