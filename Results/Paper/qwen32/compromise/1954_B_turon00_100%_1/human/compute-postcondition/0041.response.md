The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and the value of `cnt`. The values of `n` and `a[i]` are not affected by this operation. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` remains valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
