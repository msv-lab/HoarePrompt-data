The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given the initial state where `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is `0`, the new value of `ans` will be `0` because `0` is less than `n` (since `n` is at least `1`).

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that `n` ≥ 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is 0; `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`**.
