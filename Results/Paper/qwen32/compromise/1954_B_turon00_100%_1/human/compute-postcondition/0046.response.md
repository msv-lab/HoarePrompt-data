The code snippet provided is:
```python
ans = min(ans, cnt)
```

This line of code updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and the value of `cnt`. The variables `n` and `i` are not affected by this line of code.

Given that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has been incremented by 1 previously), these conditions remain unchanged. The value of `ans` after the execution of this line is the minimum of its previous value and the value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
