Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `input` holds the entire input read from standard input; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` by whitespace; `idx` is 1.**

Natural Language: The variable `t` has been assigned the integer value from the first element of the `data` list, which represents the number of test cases. The variable `idx` has been incremented by 1 to point to the next element in the `data` list. All other variables retain their initial states.
