The code snippet provided is `cnt += v[i]`. This line increments the variable `cnt` by the value of `v[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given.
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now `n` (or reflects the count of each unique `x` value).
- If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.
- If `v[i]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged.
- In both cases, `idx` is `idx + 3n + 2` and `cnt` is 0.
- `results` now includes `str(ans)` appended `n` times.

After executing `cnt += v[i]`, the value of `cnt` is updated to `cnt + v[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now `n`, `ans` is updated if `v[i] >= 3`, `idx` is `idx + 3n + 2`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `results` includes `str(ans)` appended `n` times.**
