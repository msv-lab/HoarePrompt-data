The code snippet provided increments the value of `idx` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results`, `v`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `x`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `idx` is `idx + n + 2`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the values in `v`, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end, `x` is `int(data[idx + n + 1])`.**

In simple terms, `idx` has been increased by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values.
