Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the integer value at `data[idx]` and is at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented based on the values in `data`, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 1`, `cnt` is 0, and `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3. `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, and `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.**

This postcondition retains all the conditions from the precondition and includes the additional information that `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, which is the condition that must be true for the if statement to be entered. It also specifies that `ans` is updated accordingly and `results` is updated with the new value of `ans`.
