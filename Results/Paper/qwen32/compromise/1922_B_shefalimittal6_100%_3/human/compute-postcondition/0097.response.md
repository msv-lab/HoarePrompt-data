The code snippet `x = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `x` to the integer value of the element at index `idx` in the list `data`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now 1
- `idx` is `idx + 2n + 3`
- `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` (which is now 1)
- `ans` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the conditions in the loop body
- `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end
- `x` is `int(data[idx - 1])`

After executing `x = int(data[idx])`, the value of `x` changes to `int(data[idx])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now 1, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 3`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` (which is now 1), `ans` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the conditions in the loop body, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end, `x` is `int(data[idx])`.**
