The code snippet provided updates the variable `ans` based on the values of `cnt`, `v[i]`, and a combinatorial calculation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given.
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (where `x` is an integer from `data` corresponding to the current iteration) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `data`.
- `idx` is `idx + n`.
- `cnt` is `v[0]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `ans` remains unchanged.

The code snippet:
```
ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
```

This line calculates the combination of `v[i]` taken 2 at a time (which is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`), multiplies it by `cnt`, and adds the result to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` elements, `idx` is `idx + n`, `cnt` is `v[0]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**
