Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now `n`, `idx` is `idx + 3n + 2`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i] + v[i]`, `results` includes `str(ans)` appended `n` times, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to it. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
