Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the integer value at `data[idx]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented based on the values in `data`, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 1`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if v[i] >= 2:
        ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
    if v[i] >= 3:
        ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
    cnt += v[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the integer value at `data[idx]` and is at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented based on the values in `data`, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the integer value at `data[idx]` and is at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented based on the values in `data`, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `i` is `n + 1`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the integer value at `data[idx]` and is at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented based on the values in `data`, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + 2 * v[i]`, `i` is `n`, and `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i]` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
