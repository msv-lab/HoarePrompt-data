The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables, with `results` being the only new addition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `input` holds the entire input read from standard input; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` by whitespace; `idx` is 2; `results` is an empty list.**
