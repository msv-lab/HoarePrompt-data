Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string input by the user and has a length of at least 2, `flag` is 0. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**
