Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string with at least one character, `i` is `i + 1`, `q` is `q + 1`, `flag` is 1, and `count` is increased by 1 if the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: The variable `flag` has been set to 1. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `i`, `q`, and `count`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
