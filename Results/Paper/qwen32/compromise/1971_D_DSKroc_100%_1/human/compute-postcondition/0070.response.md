Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string with at least one character, `i` is `i + 1`, `q` is `q + 1`, `flag` is 1 if `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`, otherwise `flag` remains unchanged, and `count` is increased by 1 if the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**
