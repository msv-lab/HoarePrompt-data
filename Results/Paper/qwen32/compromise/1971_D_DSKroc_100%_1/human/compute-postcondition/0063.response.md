Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string with at least one character, `flag` is 0, and `q` is `q + 1`. The integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is less than the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0. The current value of `count` is 1.**
