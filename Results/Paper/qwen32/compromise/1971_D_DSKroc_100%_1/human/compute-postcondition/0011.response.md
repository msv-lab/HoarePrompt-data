Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string input by the user and has a length of at least 2, `flag` is 1 if the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is less than the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, otherwise `flag` remains 0, and `count` is 1 if `flag` is 1, otherwise `count` remains 0.**
