You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It calculates and prints the number of positions where two consecutive characters in `s` are different, adding 1 to this count if there is no position where a '0' is followed by a '1'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a binary string, find the minimum number of pieces to cut it into so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
- A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.
- The pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string.
- Each character must lie in exactly one piece.
- You must use all pieces in the rearrangement.

### Provided Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Counting Transitions:**
   - The program counts the number of transitions between '0' and '1' using the variable `count`.
   - Each transition indicates a potential cut point to ensure that all '0's are together and all '1's are together.

2. **Handling Already Sorted Strings:**
   - The `flag` variable is used to check if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'.
   - If no such transition exists (`flag == 0`), it means the string is already sorted, and the program prints `count + 1`. This is incorrect because an already sorted string requires only one piece (`count` should be 0, not `count + 1`).

### Specific Example:
- Consider the input `00000000`:
  - There are no transitions (`count = 0`).
  - Since the string is already sorted, `flag` remains `0`.
  - The program prints `count + 1 = 1`, which is correct.
- Consider the input `11111111`:
  - There are no transitions (`count = 0`).
  - Since the string is already sorted, `flag` remains `0`.
  - The program prints `count + 1 = 1`, which is correct.
- Consider the input `10101010`:
  - There are 7 transitions (`count = 7`).
  - Since there is a transition from '1' to '0', `flag` becomes `1`.
  - The program prints `count = 7`, which is correct.
- Consider the input `0001111`:
  - There is 1 transition (`count = 1`).
  - Since there is a transition from '0' to '1', `flag` becomes `1`.
  - The program prints `count = 1`, which is correct.
- Consider the input `10`:
  - There is 1 transition (`count = 1`).
  - Since there is a transition from '1' to '0', `flag` becomes `1`.
  - The program prints `count = 1`, which is correct.
- Consider the input `11010`:
  - There are 3 transitions (`count = 3`).
  - Since there is a transition from '1' to '0', `flag` becomes `1`.
  - The program prints `count = 3`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the cases where there are transitions between '0' and '1', but it incorrectly handles the case where the string is already sorted. The program adds an unnecessary piece in such cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly adds an extra piece when the binary string is already sorted. This is because it incorrectly increments the count by 1 when `flag == 0`. For example, the string `00000000` should require 1 piece, but the program outputs 2.
