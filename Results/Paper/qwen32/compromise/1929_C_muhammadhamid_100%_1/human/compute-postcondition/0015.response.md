Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 0**

In natural language, the value of `s` is updated to be the original value of `s` plus the integer division of `s` by `k - 1` plus 1. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
