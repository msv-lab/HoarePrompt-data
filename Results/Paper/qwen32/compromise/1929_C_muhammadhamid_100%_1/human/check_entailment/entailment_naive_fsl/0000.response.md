Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the constraints. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not consider all possible scenarios for Sasha's betting strategy.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
```

The program calculates `s` by simulating a sequence of bets where Sasha loses `x` times in a row. However, the calculation of `s` does not correctly reflect the worst-case scenario for Sasha's coins. Specifically, the calculation of `s` does not account for the fact that Sasha can strategically choose his bet sizes to maximize his coins even after a series of losses.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the test case `k = 2`, `x = 2`, and `a = 1`. According to the problem description, Sasha can achieve any number of coins because he can bet 1 coin on the first try. If he loses, he can bet 1 coin again on the second try. If he wins, his coins will be 2, and he can continue to bet strategically. However, the program will output "NO" for this test case because it calculates `s` as follows:

1. `s = 1`
2. After the first loss: `s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`
3. After the second loss: `s = 3 + 3 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 7`

Since `a = 1` and `s = 7`, the program will output "NO", which is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated analysis of Sasha's betting strategy, considering the possibility of increasing bet sizes after wins and carefully managing losses to ensure that Sasha can always reach any desired number of coins.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
