The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value of the element at index `x` in the list `b` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `b[x]` is increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `r` is a string containing the element at index `x` from `a`, `b` is a list with values incremented based on the occurrences of each element in `s` and the value at index `x` is incremented by 1, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.**
