The code snippet provided is:

```python
r += a[x]
```

This line of code appends the value of `a[x]` to the current value of `r`. Given the initial state, `r` is initially the string `2 * a[x]`. After executing this line, `r` will be `2 * a[x] + a[x]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[x]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `b`, `x`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `r` is the string `3 * a[x]`; `b` is a list with the value at index `x` incremented by 1 (again); `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`; `i` is `s[j+1]` where `j` is the index of `s_next` in `s`.**
