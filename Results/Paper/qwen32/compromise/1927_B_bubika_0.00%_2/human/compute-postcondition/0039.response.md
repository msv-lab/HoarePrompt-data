The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer that is provided as input. The other variables `t`, `s`, `r`, and `b` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `r` is the concatenated string of `a[x]` for each `i` in `s`; `b` is a list with values incremented based on the occurrences of each element in `s`.**
