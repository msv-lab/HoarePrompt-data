Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `r` is the original `r` concatenated with `a[x]` again, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1, `i` is the next element in the list `s`. `b[x]` has been incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value at index `x` in the list `b` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
