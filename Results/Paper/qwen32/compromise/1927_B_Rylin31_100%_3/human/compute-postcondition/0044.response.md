The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends a character to the string `ans` based on the value of `s[j]`. Given that `s[j]` is 2, the character appended will be `chr(2 + 97)`, which is `chr(99)`, or the character `'c'`. Therefore, `ans` will change from `'ab'` to `'abc'`.

The other variables remain unchanged by the code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 2, `array` is a list of integers from the input, `ans` is `'abc'`, `j` is the next element in `array`**.
