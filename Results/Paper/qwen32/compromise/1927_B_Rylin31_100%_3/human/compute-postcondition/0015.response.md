To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the steps involved in forming the `ans` string.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value seems to be related to the number of test cases, but it does not directly affect the formation of `ans` in this context.
2. `l` is an input integer representing the length of the list `s`.
3. `s` is a list of length `l` where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j` appears in `array`.
4. `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
5. `ans` is a string formed by concatenating characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`.

### Steps to Form `ans`:
1. **Counting Occurrences**: The list `s` is constructed such that `s[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `array`.
2. **Forming `ans` String**:
   - For each element `j` in `array`, the corresponding ASCII value is calculated as `s[j] + 97`.
   - The character corresponding to this ASCII value is appended to the `ans` string.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's assume an example to make this clearer:
- Suppose `array = [0, 1, 1, 2]`.
- The list `s` would then be constructed as follows:
  - `s[0]` is the count of `0` in `array`, which is `1`.
  - `s[1]` is the count of `1` in `array`, which is `2`.
  - `s[2]` is the count of `2` in `array`, which is `1`.
  - Therefore, `s = [1, 2, 1]`.
- Now, forming `ans`:
  - For `j = 0` in `array`, `s[0] + 97 = 1 + 97 = 98`, which corresponds to the character `'b'`.
  - For `j = 1` in `array`, `s[1] + 97 = 2 + 97 = 99`, which corresponds to the character `'c'`.
  - For `j = 1` in `array`, `s[1] + 97 = 2 + 97 = 99`, which corresponds to the character `'c'`.
  - For `j = 2` in `array`, `s[2] + 97 = 1 + 97 = 98`, which corresponds to the character `'b'`.
- Therefore, `ans = 'bccb'`.

### General Description:
The `ans` string is formed by taking each element `j` in `array`, looking up the count of `j` in `s`, adding `97` to this count to get an ASCII value, converting this ASCII value to a character, and concatenating all these characters together.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is a string formed by concatenating characters corresponding to the ASCII values of s[j] + 97 for each j in array)**
