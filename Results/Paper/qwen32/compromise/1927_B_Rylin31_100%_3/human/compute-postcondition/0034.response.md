The code snippet creates a list `s` with `l` elements, all initialized to 0. The variables `i` and `l` are not modified in the process of creating this list. Therefore, the value of `i` remains `x + 1`, and `l` retains its input value.

Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros**.
