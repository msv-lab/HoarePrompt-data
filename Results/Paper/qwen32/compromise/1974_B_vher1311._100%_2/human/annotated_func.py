#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of all strings b across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining the mirrored characters from the `encoded` list based on the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a single string formed by replacing each character in the input strings with its mirrored counterpart based on a mapping derived from the unique characters in the input.
