Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to decode a string that has been encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves creating a string `r` of unique characters from the encoded string `b`, sorted alphabetically. Each character in `b` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. The program correctly reverses this process to decode the string.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. The program reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
3. It defines a function `func_1` that performs the decoding:
   - It creates a string `r` that contains all unique characters from `b`, sorted in alphabetical order.
   - It constructs a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - It uses this mapping to decode the string `b` by replacing each character with its mapped counterpart.
4. The decoded strings are collected and printed.

The execution summary provided describes the function's behavior accurately. The program correctly constructs the mapping and applies it to decode the string, following the described algorithm.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correctly implemented to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
