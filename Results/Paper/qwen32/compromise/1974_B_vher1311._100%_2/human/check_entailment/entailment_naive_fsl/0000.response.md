Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. The issue lies in the `func_1` function where the mapping is created incorrectly. The mapping should map each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`, but the current implementation maps each character to its inverse position in `r` instead of its symmetric position.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

- The string `r` is constructed as the sorted set of unique characters from the encoded string `b`.
- The mapping dictionary is created with the line `mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}`. This line maps each character in `r` to the character at the position `-(i + 1)`, which is not the symmetric character. Instead, it should map each character in `r` to the character at the position `len(r) - 1 - i`.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:
```python
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[len(r) - 1 - i] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all test cases. However, since the original code does not include this correction, it is incorrect.

To illustrate the problem, consider the following test case:
Input:
```
1
6
abcdef
```
Expected Output:
```
fedcba
```
However, the original code would output:
```
fedcbf
```
This is because the original code incorrectly maps 'a' to 'f', 'b' to 'e', 'c' to 'd', 'd' to 'c', 'e' to 'b', and 'f' to 'a', but then it incorrectly maps 'f' to 'f' again instead of 'a'.
