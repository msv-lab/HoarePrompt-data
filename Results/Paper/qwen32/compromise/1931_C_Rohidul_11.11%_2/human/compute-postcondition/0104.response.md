To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(0, ans))` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and how the variable `ans` is calculated based on different conditions.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `r` is the index of the first element from the end that is different from its successor, or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal.
2. `end` is the number of times the loop decremented `r`.
3. `ans` is calculated based on the following conditions:
   - If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
   - If `a[0] != a[-1]` and `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.

### Analysis:
The `max(0, ans)` function ensures that the printed value is at least 0, regardless of the calculated value of `ans`. Let's break down the possible values of `ans`:

1. **Case 1: `a[0] == a[-1]`**
   - `ans` is calculated as `r - l - 1`.
   - Since `r` and `l` are indices in the list, `r - l - 1` could be negative, zero, or positive.
   - `max(0, r - l - 1)` ensures the output is at least 0.

2. **Case 2: `a[0] != a[-1]` and `st` is 0 and `end` is 0**
   - `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - `len(a) - 1` is always non-negative for a non-empty list `a`.

3. **Case 3: Any other case**
   - `ans` is `r - l`.
   - Similar to Case 1, `r - l` could be negative, zero, or positive.
   - `max(0, r - l)` ensures the output is at least 0.

### Conclusion:
The `print(max(0, ans))` statement will print the maximum of 0 and the value of `ans` based on the conditions described above. Given the conditions, the output will always be a non-negative integer.

### Final Output:
Output: **max(0, ans) (where ans is calculated based on the conditions provided in the initial state)**
