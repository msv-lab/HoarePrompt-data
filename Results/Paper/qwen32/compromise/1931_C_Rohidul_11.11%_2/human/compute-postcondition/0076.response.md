Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input where `a[0] == a[1]`; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n > 1`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 0; `end` is 0; If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
