Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 0, 0
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = r - l - 1
    elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        ans = len(a) - 1
    else:
        ans = r - l
    print(max(0, ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is the first index from the end where `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]`, or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first element that is not equal to its successor. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `n - 1` if all elements are the same, `r` is `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are the same, otherwise the index where the sequence of equal elements stops, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list up to the point where the sequence of equal elements stops. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is the index of the first element from the end that is different from its successor, or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal; `end` is the number of times the loop decremented `r`. If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `a[0] != a[-1]` and `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
