The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `r` was initially `l + 1`, after the decrement, `r` becomes `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `end` is 0**.
