Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is the first index from the end where `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]`, or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first element that is not equal to its successor. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.**
