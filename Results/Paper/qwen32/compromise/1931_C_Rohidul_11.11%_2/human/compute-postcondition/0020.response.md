The code snippet provided increments the variable `end` by 1. Therefore, the value of `end` will change from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `end` is 2; `a[r] == a[r - 1]`**
