The code snippet `ans = len(a) - 1` assigns the value `len(a) - 1` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `ans` is now `len(a) - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `n - 1` if all elements are the same, `r` is `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are the same, otherwise the index where the sequence of equal elements stops, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`. The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`. `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.**
