The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of the variable `l` by 1. Given the initial state, `l` was initially 2. After the increment, `l` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]`, `a[1] == a[2]`, and `a[2] == a[3]`; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n >= 3`; `l` is 3; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 2; `end` is 0**.
