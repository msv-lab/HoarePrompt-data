The loop head in the provided code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will iterate a number of times specified by the input integer `n`. The loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, so we don't need to adjust it. The only state that can be adjusted in relation to the loop head is the input integer `n`, which determines the number of iterations.

Given that the loop iterates `n` times, and we are at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `n` to reflect that one iteration has been completed. Therefore, `n` should be decremented by 1 to indicate that one iteration has been processed.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer minus 1, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `n - 1` if all elements are the same, `r` is `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are the same, otherwise the index where the sequence of equal elements stops, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list up to the point where the sequence of equal elements stops. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.**
