Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1; `st` is 0; `end` is 0; If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.**

In this output state, the variables `st` and `end` have been explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
