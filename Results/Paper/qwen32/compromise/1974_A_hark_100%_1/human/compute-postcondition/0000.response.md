The given code snippet reads an integer `ap` from the input. This integer is intended to represent the number of test cases. However, the initial state provided does not include `ap` and the subsequent code does not use `ap` in any way that affects the initial state variables `t`, `x`, and `y`.

Given the code snippet, the only variable that changes is `ap`, which is assigned the value of the integer input.

Output State: **The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. `ap` is an input integer.**
