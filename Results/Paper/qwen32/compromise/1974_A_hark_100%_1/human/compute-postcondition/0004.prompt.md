You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99), where x is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and y is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon.
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each representing the number of 3x5 screens required for the applications in each test case. The variables `x` and `y` are reset to the input values for each test case, and `ap` is the number of test cases processed. The state of `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`. `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon, and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. For each test case, the function returns the total number of icons required to display all applications.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
