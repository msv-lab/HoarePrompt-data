You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99), where x is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and y is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon.

    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each representing the number of 3x5 screens required for the applications in each test case. The variables `x` and `y` are reset to the input values for each test case, and `ap` is the number of test cases processed. The state of `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of 1x1 and 2x2 applications, and calculates the minimum number of 3x5 screens required to display all applications in each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code contains a logical error and a syntax error. The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will lead to a `NameError` during execution. Moreover, the logic for calculating the minimum number of screens is incorrect.

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code:
1. It calculates `bxsfory` as the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons, assuming that each screen can fit up to 2 `2x2` icons (which is correct).
2. It then adjusts the number of `1x1` icons by subtracting the space occupied by the `2x2` icons (`bxsfory * 15`), where `15` is the number of `1x1` cells occupied by `2x2` icons (4 cells per icon, but it seems to be treating it as 15 for some reason).
3. It then calculates `bxsfory1` as the number of screens needed for the remaining `1x1` icons.
4. The final result is the sum of screens needed for `2x2` and `1x1` icons.

The main issue is the incorrect handling of the remaining `1x1` icons after placing `2x2` icons. The code incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` from `x` instead of `bxsfory * 4`. This can lead to incorrect calculations.

Let's consider a test case:
- Input: `x = 13, y = 2`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `3`

Explanation of the test case:
- For `y = 2`, we need `1` screen to place both `2x2` icons (since each screen can fit up to 2 `2x2` icons).
- After placing `2x2` icons, we have `13 - 2*4 = 5` `1x1` icons left.
- We need `1` more screen to place the remaining `5` `1x1` icons (since each screen can fit up to `15` `1x1` icons, but we only need `1` screen for `5` icons).

However, the code incorrectly calculates the remaining `1x1` icons as `13 - 2*15 = -17`, which leads to an incorrect result.

Thus, the code is incorrect.
