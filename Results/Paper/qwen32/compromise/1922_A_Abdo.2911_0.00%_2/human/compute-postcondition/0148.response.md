Output State: **`match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is False; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; the character at `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter; `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
