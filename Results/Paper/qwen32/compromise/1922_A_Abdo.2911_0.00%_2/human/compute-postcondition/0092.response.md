The code snippet `template = []` reassigns the `template` variable to an empty list, disregarding its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is a positive integer input by the user; `a` is the new string input by the user; `b` is the new string input by the user; `c` is the new string input by the user; `template` is an empty list; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` retains its initial value.**
