Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    template = []
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            template.append(a[i])
        else:
            template.append(a[i].upper())
    match_a_b = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                match_a_b = False
                break
        elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
            ].lower():
            match_a_b = False
            break
    match_c = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if c[i] != template[i]:
                match_c = False
                break
        elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
            match_c = False
            break
    if match_a_b and not match_c:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` is `False` if `match_a_b` is `True` and `c` does not match `template`, otherwise `match_c` retains its initial value or becomes `True` if `c` matches `template`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True. If `match_a_b` is False and `match_c` is True, then the if block is executed. Otherwise, the else block is executed, maintaining the conditions that `match_a_b` reflects the loop condition state and `match_c` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `match_a_b` is True. If `match_c` is False, then the program does not change the state of `match_c`. If `match_c` is True, then the program does not change the state of `match_c` either. In both cases, the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` are consistent with the conditions evaluated in the if-else block.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
