Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user, `match_c` retains its initial value, `template` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise `a[i].upper()`. If `a[i] != template[i]` or `b[i] != template[i]` when `i` is 4, `match_a_b` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` retains its initial value.**
