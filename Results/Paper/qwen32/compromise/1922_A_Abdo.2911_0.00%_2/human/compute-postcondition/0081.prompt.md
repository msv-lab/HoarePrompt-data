Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `True` if for all `i` in the range of `n`, `template[i]` is lowercase and both `a[i] == template[i]` and `b[i] == template[i]`, or `template[i]` is uppercase and neither `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` nor `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `i` is 0. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` is set to `False`. If `template[i]` is uppercase and `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `match_c` retains its initial value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `i` is 1. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i] != template[i]`, then `match_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i] == template[i]`, then `match_c` retains its initial value. If `template[i]` is uppercase and `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`, `match_a_b` retains its initial value, `i` is 2. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then if `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
