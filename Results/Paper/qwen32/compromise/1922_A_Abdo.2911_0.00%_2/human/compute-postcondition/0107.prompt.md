Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is a positive integer input by the user; `a` is the new string input by the user; `b` is the new string input by the user; `c` is the new string input by the user; `template` is an empty list; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` retains its initial value.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` retains its initial value; `template` is a list. If the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in `b`, `template` contains the character `a[i]`. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` retains its initial value; `template` is a list with an additional element appended to it, which is `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise `a[i].upper()`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` retains its initial value; `template` is a list with an additional element appended to it, which is `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise `a[i].upper()`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
