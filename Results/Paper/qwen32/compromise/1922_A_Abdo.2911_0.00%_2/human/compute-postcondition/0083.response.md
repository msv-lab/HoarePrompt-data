The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides various variables and their definitions, but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
2. `n` is a positive integer.
3. `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
4. `template` is a list of `n` characters derived from `a` and `b` based on a specific condition.
5. `match_a_b` is a boolean set to `True`.
6. `match_c` is a boolean set to `False`.

None of these variables or their values affect the `print` statement. The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
