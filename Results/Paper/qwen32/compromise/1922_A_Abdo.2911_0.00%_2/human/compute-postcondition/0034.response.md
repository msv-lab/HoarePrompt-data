Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is `False` if either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`; otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is `False` if `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or both) matches the lowercase version of `template[i]`; otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.**
