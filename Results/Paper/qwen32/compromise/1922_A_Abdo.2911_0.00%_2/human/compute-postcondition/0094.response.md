Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` and `b` are strings input by the user; `c` is a string input by the user; `template` is an empty list; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` retains its initial value; at the current index `i`, the character of `a[i]` is equal to the character of `b[i]`.**
