Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` retains its initial value, `template` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise `a[i].upper()`, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter. The current value of `template[i]` is such that either `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`.**

In natural language: The value of `match_a_b` has been changed to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
