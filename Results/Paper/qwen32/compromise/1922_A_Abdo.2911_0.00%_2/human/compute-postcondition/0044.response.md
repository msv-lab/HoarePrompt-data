Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`; `match_a_b` is False; `i` is incremented by 1 if `match_a_b` remains `True`.**

In this output state, the variable `match_a_b` has been explicitly set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and states, as the code snippet only affects `match_a_b`.
