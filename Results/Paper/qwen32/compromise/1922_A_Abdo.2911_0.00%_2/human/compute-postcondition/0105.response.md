Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` retains its initial value; `template` is a list with an additional element appended to it, which is `a[i].upper()`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Explanation: The value of `template` is updated by appending `a[i].upper()`, and `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
