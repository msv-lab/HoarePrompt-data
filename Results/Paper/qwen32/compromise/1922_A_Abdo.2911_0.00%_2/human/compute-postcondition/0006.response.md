The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `template`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code. Therefore, the Output State will reflect this with `template` being an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is an empty list.**
