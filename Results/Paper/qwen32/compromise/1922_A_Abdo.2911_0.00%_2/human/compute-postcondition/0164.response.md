The `break` statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement we are directly inside, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `n`, and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`match_a_b` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` and `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value; `match_c` is False; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
