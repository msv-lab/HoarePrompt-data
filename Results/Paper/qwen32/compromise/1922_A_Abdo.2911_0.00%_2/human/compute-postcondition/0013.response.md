The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's assume it is `i = k` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` should be `k + 1`. Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value `k`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `template` is a list containing the character `a[i]`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of `a[i]`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.** 

To be more specific, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `template` is a list containing the character `a[i]`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of `a[i]`. `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Since we are only adjusting the loop variable `i`, the final state can be generalized as:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `template` is a list containing the character `a[i]`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of `a[i]`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
