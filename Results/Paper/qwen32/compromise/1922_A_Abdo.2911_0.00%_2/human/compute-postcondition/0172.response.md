Postcondition: ***`match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True. If `match_a_b` is False and `match_c` is True, then the if block is executed. Otherwise, the else block is executed, maintaining the conditions that `match_a_b` reflects the loop condition state and `match_c` remains True.***
