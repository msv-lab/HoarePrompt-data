Output State: **`match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus `n` and `_` is less than `t`; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the stripped input string; `c` is the stripped input string; `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`; `template[i]` is not a lowercase character; either `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` for the current value of `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
