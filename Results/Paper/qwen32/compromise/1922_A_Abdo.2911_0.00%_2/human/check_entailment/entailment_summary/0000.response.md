Reasoning:
The program constructs a template based on the given strings `a` and `b`. If characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, the template takes that character in lowercase. If they differ, the template takes that character in uppercase. 

The program then checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template according to the problem's conditions. Specifically, if the template character is lowercase, the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` must match it exactly. If the template character is uppercase, the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` must differ from the lowercase version of the template character.

Finally, the program checks if `c` does not match the template under the same conditions. If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic in the program aligns with the problem description and correctly handles the conditions specified. The execution summary also supports this reasoning by describing the steps accurately.

Correctness: **True**
