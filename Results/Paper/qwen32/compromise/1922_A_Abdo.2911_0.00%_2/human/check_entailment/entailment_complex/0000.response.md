### Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not. The logic of the function is as follows:

1. For each test case, the function reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`.
2. It constructs a template string by iterating over each character position from 0 to `n-1`:
   - If the characters at the current position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the lowercase version of that character to the template.
   - If the characters are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` (or `b`, since they are different) to the template.
3. It then checks if the template matches `a` and `b` correctly:
   - For each position in the template, if the character is lowercase, it checks if both `a` and `b` have the same lowercase character at that position.
   - If the character is uppercase, it checks if both `a` and `b` do not have the lowercase version of that character at that position.
4. It checks if the template does not match `c`:
   - For each position in the template, if the character is lowercase, it checks if `c` has the same lowercase character at that position.
   - If the character is uppercase, it checks if `c` has the lowercase version of that character at that position.
5. If the template matches `a` and `b` correctly and does not match `c`, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The function is correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement. The template construction ensures that `a` and `b` match the template correctly, and the subsequent checks ensure that `c` does not match the template. The provided example inputs and outputs are consistent with the function's logic, and no errors are apparent in the code.

### Correctness: **True**
