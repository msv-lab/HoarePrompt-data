You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads input parameters for multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It calculates and prints a result for each test case based on these inputs, which represents a computed value `ans` that accounts for the chosen vertices and additional vertices to be considered.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides. We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces by selecting up to `y` additional vertices from the `x` vertices already chosen by Bessie.

### Key Points:
1. **Vertices Selection:** We start with `x` vertices and can add up to `y` more vertices.
2. **Triangle Formation:** Triangles can be formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals between the chosen vertices.
3. **Maximize Triangles:** The goal is to maximize the number of such triangles.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, and then the list of `x` vertices.

2. **Vertex Index Adjustment:**
   - The vertices are adjusted by subtracting 1 to make them zero-indexed for easier manipulation in Python.

3. **Initial Triangles Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `x - 2`. This is because with `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed without additional vertices is `x - 2`.

4. **Checking Adjacent Vertices:**
   - The program checks if the vertices next to each chosen vertex (both clockwise and counterclockwise) can be used to form additional triangles. If a vertex can form a triangle with an adjacent vertex already in the set, it increments `ans`.

5. **Gap Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between each pair of consecutive chosen vertices. These gaps represent the number of vertices between two chosen vertices that are not yet considered.
   - The gaps are sorted in ascending order.

6. **Maximizing Triangles with Additional Vertices:**
   - For each gap, the program calculates the number of pairs that can be added within the gap to form triangles. If the number of available vertices `y` is sufficient, it adds the maximum possible triangles and reduces `y` accordingly.
   - If `y` is not sufficient to fill the gap completely, it adds as many triangles as possible with the remaining vertices and breaks out of the loop.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum number of triangles for each test case.

### Correctness Consideration:
The program seems to follow a logical approach to maximize the number of triangles by considering both the initial set of vertices and the additional vertices that can be added. It correctly handles the constraints and uses a greedy strategy to maximize the number of triangles.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct for the given problem constraints and logic.

**Correctness: True**
