The function reads input parameters for multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It calculates and prints a result for each test case based on these inputs, which represents a computed value `ans` that accounts for the chosen vertices and additional vertices to be considered.
