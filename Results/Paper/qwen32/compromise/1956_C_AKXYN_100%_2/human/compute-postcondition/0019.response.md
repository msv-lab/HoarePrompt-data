Let's break down the given code and initial state to determine the output:

1. **Variable `t`**: Must be greater than or equal to 1. However, its value is not used in the provided code snippet.
2. **Variable `n`**: Must be greater than 2. This value is used in the `range` function.
3. **Variable `mat`**: It is described as a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`. However, `mat` is not used in the provided code snippet.
4. **Variable `res`**: It is set to 22. However, `res` is not used in the provided code snippet.
5. **Variable `i`**: It is set to 0. This value is used in the `print` statement.

Now, let's analyze the `print` statement:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

- `'1 %d' % i`:
  - This is a string formatting expression.
  - `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
  - `i` is 0, so `'1 %d' % i` evaluates to `'1 0'`.

- `*range(1, n + 1)`:
  - The `range` function generates numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
  - `*` unpacks the range into individual arguments for the `print` function.
  - Since `n` is greater than 2, let's assume `n` is 3 for concreteness (the exact value of `n` is not specified, but it must be greater than 2).
  - `range(1, 3 + 1)` generates the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
  - Unpacking these numbers into the `print` function results in the numbers being printed separately.

So, combining these parts, the `print` statement will output:
```
1 0 1 2 3
```

Output: **1 0 1 2 3**
