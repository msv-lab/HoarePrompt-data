Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. `n` must be greater than 2.
3. `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.
4. `res` is 22.
5. `i` is 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(res, n << 1)
```

### Analysis:
- `res` is explicitly given as 22.
- `n << 1` is a bitwise left shift operation. This operation shifts the bits of `n` to the left by 1 position, which is equivalent to multiplying `n` by 2. Therefore, `n << 1` is the same as `2 * n`.

Since `n` is greater than 2, let's denote `n` as a specific value greater than 2 for the sake of explanation. We don't need the exact value of `n` to describe the output, but we can use a placeholder to illustrate the operation.

For example, if `n` is 3, then `n << 1` would be `3 << 1`, which is `6` (since 3 * 2 = 6).

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `res` (which is 22) followed by the value of `n << 1` (which is `2 * n`).

Output: **22, 2 * n (where n is greater than 2)**
