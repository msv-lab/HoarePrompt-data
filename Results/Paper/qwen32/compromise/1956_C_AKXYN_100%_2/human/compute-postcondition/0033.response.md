Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 (but its specific value is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is 5.
- `mat` is a list of 5 lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to 5 (but it is not used in the print statement).
- `res` is 95.
- `i` is 4 (but it is not used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(res, n << 1)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`res`**: The value of `res` is explicitly given as 95.
2. **`n << 1`**: This is a bitwise left shift operation. In Python, `n << 1` shifts the bits of `n` to the left by 1 position. Since `n` is 5 (binary `101`), shifting it left by 1 position results in `1010` in binary, which is 10 in decimal.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `res` followed by the result of `n << 1`.

Output: **95, 10**
