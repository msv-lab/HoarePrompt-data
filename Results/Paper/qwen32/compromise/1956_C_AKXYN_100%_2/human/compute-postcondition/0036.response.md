Let's break down the `print` statement and the variables involved:

1. **`'2 %d' % i`**: This is a string formatting operation. The `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, and it will be replaced by the value of the variable `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is 4. Therefore, `'2 %d' % i` will be replaced by `'2 4'`.

2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**: The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is 5, `range(1, 6)` will generate the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The `*` operator before `range(1, n + 1)` unpacks this sequence into individual arguments to the `print` function. Therefore, `*range(1, n + 1)` will result in the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 being printed as separate items.

Putting it all together, the `print` statement will output the string `'2 4'` followed by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, each separated by a space.

Output: **2 4 1 2 3 4 5**
