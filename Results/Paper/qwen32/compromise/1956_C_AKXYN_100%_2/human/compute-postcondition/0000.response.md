In the provided task, the for loop is iterating over a range defined by the input integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop body is omitted, so we only need to adjust the states of the objects mentioned in the loop head.

Here's the loop:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head contains:
- `_` (which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted as it is not used in the loop body)
- `range(int(input()))` (which depends on the input value `t`)

To ensure the loop executes, the input value `t` must be at least 1. The state of `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not used within the loop body.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**

To summarize, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value `t`, which must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
