The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop is iterating from `n` down to 1, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change during the iterations.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 22, `i` is 1**
