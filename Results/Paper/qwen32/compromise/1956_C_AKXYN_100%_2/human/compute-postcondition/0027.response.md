The code snippet `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` updates the value of `res` by adding the product of `(i + 1)` and `(2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Given that the initial state sets `i` to 0, we can calculate the new value of `res` as follows:

- `i` is 0.
- `(i + 1)` evaluates to `1`.
- `(2 * i + 1)` evaluates to `1`.
- Therefore, `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` evaluates to `1`.
- `res` is initially `0`, so `res += 1` updates `res` to `1`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1, `i` is 0**.
