Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1 (not used in the print statement)
- `n` is 5
- `mat` is a list of 5 lists, each containing integers from 1 to 5 (not used in the print statement)
- `res` is 95 (not used in the print statement)
- `i` is 4

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **String Formatting with `%d`:**
   - `'1 %d' % i` will replace `%d` with the value of `i`.
   - Since `i` is 4, `'1 %d' % i` becomes `'1 4'`.

2. **Using `*range(1, n + 1)`:**
   - `n` is 5, so `range(1, n + 1)` translates to `range(1, 6)`, which generates the sequence of numbers from 1 to 5.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range into individual arguments to the `print` function.
   - Therefore, `*range(1, 6)` becomes `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Combining Both Parts:
- The `print` function will output the string `'1 4'` followed by the unpacked range of numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 4 1 2 3 4 5**
