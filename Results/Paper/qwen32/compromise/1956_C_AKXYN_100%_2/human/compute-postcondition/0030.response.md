The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 7, `i` is 2**
