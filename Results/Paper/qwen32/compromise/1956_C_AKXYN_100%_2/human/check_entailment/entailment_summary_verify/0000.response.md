Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct or not.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to fill an \( n \times n \) matrix with the maximum possible sum using no more than \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Program Analysis
The provided program does the following for each test case:
1. Initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` where each row is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
2. Computes a result `res` using the formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\).
3. Prints the result `res` and the number of operations `2n`.
4. Outputs \( n \) operations of type 1 (filling rows) and \( n \) operations of type 2 (filling columns) with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Function Summary
The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the program as it processes each test case, calculates the result, and outputs the operations.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment is incorrect in its reasoning and conclusion. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Formula for Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\) does not yield the maximum possible sum of the matrix. This formula is not related to the optimal strategy for maximizing the sum.
   - The optimal strategy is to fill each row and column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to maximize the sum. The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled in this manner is \(\frac{n^2 (n + 1)}{2}\).

2. **Incorrect Operations**:
   - The operations performed by the program do not achieve the maximum sum. The program fills each row and column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which does not maximize the sum.
   - The optimal operations would involve filling each row (or column) with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

### Correct Implementation
To maximize the sum, we should fill each row (or column) with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(n, 0, -1)) for _ in range(n)]
        res = n * (n * n + 1) // 2
        print(res, n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', i, *mat[i-1])

func()
```

### Final Evaluation
The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix for all possible cases. The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the program.

**Final: False**
