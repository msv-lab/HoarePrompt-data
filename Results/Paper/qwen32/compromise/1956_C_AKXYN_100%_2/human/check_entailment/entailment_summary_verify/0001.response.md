### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an `n x n` matrix using up to `2n` operations.
- Two types of operations are allowed:
  - Type 1: Fill a row `i` with a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`.
  - Type 2: Fill a column `i` with a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`.
- The goal is to find the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - It initializes a matrix `mat` of size `n x n` with each row filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum `res` using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - This formula does not directly compute the maximum sum of the matrix. The maximum sum should be the sum of all unique numbers from `1` to `n` placed in the matrix, which is `n * n * (n + 1) / 2`.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `n << 1` (which is `2 * n`).
   - It then prints `2n` operations: for each row `i` from `n` to `1`, it performs a Type 1 operation and a Type 2 operation, both using the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

#### Correctness Verification:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct maximum sum for an `n x n` matrix filled with permutations of numbers from `1` to `n` is `n * n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - For example, if `n = 2`, the maximum sum should be `2 * 2 * (2 + 1) / 2 = 6`. However, the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i = 0` and `i = 1` gives `1 * 1 + 2 * 3 = 1 + 6 = 7`, which is incorrect.

2. **Operations:**
   - The operations performed (filling each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`) are valid in terms of the constraints (no more than `2n` operations).
   - However, the sequence of operations and the way the sum is calculated are incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program's operations are valid but the sum calculation is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for calculating the maximum sum correctly.

**Final: False**
