### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with `m` cubes in the tower after making `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing exactly one cube.

The key insight is that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` must be non-negative and even. Here's why:
- Each move either adds or removes one cube.
- To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of moves to add cubes minus the number of moves to remove cubes should equal `m`.
- This implies that `n - m` must be even because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) effectively cancels out, and any remaining moves must either all add cubes (if `n - m` is positive and even) or all remove cubes (if `n - m` is zero).

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if `n - m` is non-negative and even. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
