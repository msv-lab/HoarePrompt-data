Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in a tower after `n` moves.
- **Moves**: Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
- **Input**: 
  - `t`: Number of test cases.
  - For each test case: `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes).
- **Output**: "Yes" if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, otherwise "No".

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It checks the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` and prints "Yes" if the condition is true, otherwise "No".

### Correctness Check
The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` can be analyzed as follows:
- **`(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, so an even difference means we can reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes by an even number of moves.
- **`n - m >= 0`**: This ensures that the number of moves is at least as many as the number of cubes we want to have. If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.

### Edge Cases
- **`n = m`**: This should return "Yes" because we can simply add one cube per move.
- **`n > m`**: This should return "Yes" if `n - m` is even, because we can add `m` cubes and then remove `(n - m)` cubes in pairs.
- **`n < m`**: This should return "No" because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.

### Verifying with Examples
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3` -> `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` and `3 - 3 >= 0` -> "Yes"
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4` -> `(2 - 4) % 2 != 0` -> "No"
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3` -> `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` and `5 - 3 >= 0` -> "Yes"

All the examples match the expected output.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all the cases based on the problem description. There are no edge cases or inputs that the program fails to handle correctly.

**Correctness: True**
