The initial state describes multiple test cases where for each test case, two integers `n` and `m` are provided. The conditions given are that either `n - m` is not divisible by 2, or `n - m` is less than 0. Regardless of the specific values of `n` and `m` for each test case, the print statement will always output 'No'.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
- The code snippet contains only a single `print` statement that outputs the string 'No'.
- The values of `n` and `m` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.
- The conditions provided (`n - m` not divisible by 2 or `n - m` less than 0) are used to determine whether the program reaches this print statement, but once it does, the output is always 'No'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is always 'No', regardless of the input values.

Output: **No**
