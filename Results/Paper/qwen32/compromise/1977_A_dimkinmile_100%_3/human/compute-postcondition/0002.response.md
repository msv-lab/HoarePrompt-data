The given precondition describes a scenario where there are multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. The condition specified is that the difference between `n` and `m` is non-negative and even. However, the actual values of `n` and `m` for each test case are not provided. The code snippet provided simply prints the string `'Yes'` for each test case.

Given that the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n` or `m`, the output will always be `'Yes'` regardless of the specific values of `n` and `m` as long as they satisfy the given condition.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Yes**
