Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters directly as per the provided code snippet. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function will process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of moves Nikita can make and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower. The function returns a result for each test case, indicating whether the desired number of cubes can be achieved with the given number of moves.**
