Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers read from the input; for each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1}, and 1 <= s_i <= n and s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2}. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; `L[-1]` is equal to `R[0]`; `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`.**
