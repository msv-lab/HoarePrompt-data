Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input, where `n` is the number of cows and `k` is the index of the cow owned by the player. The list of Cowdeforces ratings `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is not yet processed.**

In simpler terms: `n` and `k` have been read from the input. `n` represents the total number of cows, and `k` represents the index of the player's cow. The ratings of the cows are still waiting to be read.
