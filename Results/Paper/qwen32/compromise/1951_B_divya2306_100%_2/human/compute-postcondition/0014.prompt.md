You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and the index of the cow owned by the player. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where all a_i values are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: - `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    #   - `a` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the list.
    #   - `wins` is the number of cows whose ratings are less than or equal to the player's cow's rating, up to the point where a cow with a higher rating is encountered or all cows are compared.
    #
    #Given this analysis, the output state is:
    #
    #Output State:
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: wins - 1 (where wins is the number of cows whose ratings are less than or equal to the player's cow's rating)
        return
        #The program returns nothing (None)
    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. `a` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the list. `wins` is the number of cows whose ratings are less than or equal to the player's cow's rating, up to the point where a cow with a higher rating is encountered or all cows are compared. Additionally, `wins` is less than `k`.
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. `a` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the list. `wins` remains the number of cows whose ratings are less than or equal to the player's cow's rating, up to the point where a cow with a higher rating is encountered or all cows are compared. `win_with_swap` is the count of cows (including the player's cow) whose ratings are less than or equal to the player's cow's rating, up to the point where a cow with a higher rating is encountered or all cows are compared.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)) (where `wins` is the count of cows with ratings less than or equal to the player's cow's rating, and `win_with_swap` is the count of cows including the player's cow with ratings less than or equal to the player's cow's rating)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of cows and the index of the cow owned by the player, respectively. It also accepts a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function performs some operations based on these inputs but does not return any value (returns `None`).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing (None)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
