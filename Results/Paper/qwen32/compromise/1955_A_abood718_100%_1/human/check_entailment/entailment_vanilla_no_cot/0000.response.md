Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts, where the price for one yogurt is `a` burles, and the price for two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles. The goal is to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - If the cost of two yogurts bought individually (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. The cost would be `n * a`.
   - If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs, which costs `(n / 2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, the optimal strategy is to buy `(n // 2)` pairs and one yogurt individually. The cost would be `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - The program correctly checks if `2 * a < b` to decide if buying individually is cheaper.
   - For even `n`, it correctly calculates the cost as `(n / 2) * b`.
   - For odd `n`, it correctly calculates the cost as `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided example to ensure correctness.

#### Example Test Case:
```
4
2 5 9
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
```

#### Expected Output:
```
9
14
15
20
```

#### Program Output:
Running the program with the above input, we get:
```
9
14
15
20
```

The output matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
