### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the given program to determine if it correctly computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: number of children.
   - `m`: number of pairs of friends.
   - `k`: number of excursions.
   - `m` lines with `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`: pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Objective**:
   - Compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\).
   - Compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Key Points**:
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - When a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
   - The friendship value of non-friends is always 0.
   - We need to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` chosen pairs.

4. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends in a single excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{m}{n(n-1)/2}\).
   - The expected contribution of a pair of friends with initial friendship value `f_i` to the sum after `k` excursions is:
     \[
     f_i + \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} + \frac{2m}{\binom{n}{2}} + \ldots + \frac{km}{\binom{n}{2}} = f_i + \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
     \]
   - The expected value for all pairs is the sum of the expected contributions of all pairs.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), where `p` is the numerator and `q` is the denominator.
   - The final answer is \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) modulo `M`.
   - `s` is initialized to 0 (sum of expected values).
   - `a` is initialized to 0 (sum of initial friendship values).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each pair of friends, add their initial friendship value `f_i` to `a`.
   - For each excursion, update `s` using the formula derived from the mathematical insight.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the result modulo `M`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The loop for updating `s` is incorrect. The program incorrectly calculates the expected value for all excursions.
- The loop `for i in range(k):` should compute the expected value for all pairs, not for each excursion.
- The formula used in the loop is incorrect. The expected value should be computed based on the sum of the initial values and the contributions from the excursions.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the loop and the incorrect formula, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

**Correctness: False**
