The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `a` is 0; `i` is `k`; `s` is 0; `m` must be greater than 0; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input.**
