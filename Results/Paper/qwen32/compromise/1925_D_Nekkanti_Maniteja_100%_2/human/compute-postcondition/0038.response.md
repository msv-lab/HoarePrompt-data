Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `a` is `f + f + f`; `i` is `k + 2`; `s` is 0; `m` must be greater than `k + 2`; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input.**

Natural language: The value of `a` has been updated to be `f + f + f`, which is equivalent to `3 * f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
