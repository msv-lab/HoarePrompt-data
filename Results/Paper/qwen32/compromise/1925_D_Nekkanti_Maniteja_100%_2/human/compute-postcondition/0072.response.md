Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State Recap
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0.
- `M` is a constant integer set to 1000000007.
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations.
- `i` is `k + m`.
- `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input for each of the `m` iterations.
- `s` is calculated as `c^2 * m * ((k-1) * k // 2) + c * a * k`.

### Calculation of Variables
1. **`n * (n - 1) // 2`**: This is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items, often denoted as `C(n, 2)`.
2. **`c`**: The modular multiplicative inverse of `C(n, 2)` modulo `M`. This means `c` is the number such that `(C(n, 2) * c) % M = 1`.
3. **`a`**: This is the sum of `f` values obtained from `m` iterations. Each `f` value is read from the input.
4. **`s`**: This is calculated using the formula `c^2 * m * ((k-1) * k // 2) + c * a * k`. Here, `c^2` means `c` squared, and `((k-1) * k // 2)` is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `k` items, often denoted as `C(k, 2)`.

### Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print(s % M)
```
This statement prints the value of `s` modulo `M`.

### Final Output
The value of `s` is calculated based on the given formula and the values of `c`, `m`, `k`, and `a`. Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the `f` values are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **s % M (where s is calculated as c^2 * m * ((k-1) * k // 2) + c * a * k, and M is 1000000007)**
