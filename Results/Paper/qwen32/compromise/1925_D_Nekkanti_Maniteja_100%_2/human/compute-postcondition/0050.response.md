The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. This will overwrite the previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` with the new values provided by the input.

The other variables (`t`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `i`, `s`, `u`, `v`, `f`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are new integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input; `i` is `k + m`; `s` is `(c * k * (c * m * (k-1) + 2 * a)) // 2`; `m` iterations have been completed; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input for each of the `m` iterations.**
