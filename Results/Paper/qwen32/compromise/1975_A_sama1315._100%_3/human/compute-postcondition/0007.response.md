To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to carefully follow the changes made to the variables in the loop body.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers.
   - `data` is a list of `n` strings, each representing an integer in `a`.
   - `idx` is 1.
   - `t` is `a[0]`.
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration, `n` is set to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
   - `idx` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` is updated to be a list of integers derived from the next `n` elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]`.
   - `idx` is incremented by `n`.
   - `result` is calculated by calling `func_1(a)`.
   - `result` is appended to `results`.

3. **Output State:**
   - After the loop completes, `idx` will have been incremented by `1 + n1 + 1 + n2 + 1 + ... + nk + 1`, where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` in each iteration.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `a` will be the last list of integers processed in the loop.
   - `results` will contain the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration.
   - `data` remains unchanged as it is only read from, not modified.

Thus, the output state can be described as:
- `a` is the last list of integers processed in the loop.
- `data` remains the same as the input.
- `idx` is incremented by `1 + n1 + 1 + n2 + 1 + ... + nk + 1` where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` in each iteration.
- `t` remains the same as the input.
- `results` contains the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration.

Output State: **`a` is the last list of integers processed in the loop, `data` remains unchanged, `idx` is incremented by the sum of 1 and each `n` value processed plus the number of iterations, `t` remains the same, and `results` contains the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration.**
