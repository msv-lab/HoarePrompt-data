The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. Each string in this list corresponds to an element from the initial list `a` of integers. The `data` variable is now assigned this list of strings.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of `n` strings, where each string is the string representation of the corresponding integer in `a`.**
