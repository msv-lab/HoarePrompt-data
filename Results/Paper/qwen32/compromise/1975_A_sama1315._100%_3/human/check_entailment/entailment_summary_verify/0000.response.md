Let's carefully analyze the program and verify its correctness based on the provided problem description, code, and function summaries.

### Problem Recap
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of prefix-suffix swaps. The program reads multiple test cases, and for each, it checks if the array can be rotated to become sorted.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(a)**: This function checks if the array `a` can be rotated to become sorted.
2. **func_2()**: This function reads input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.

#### Function `func_1(a)`
- It first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
- It then concatenates `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
- It checks every possible subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a` to see if it matches `sorted_a`.
- If any subarray matches `sorted_a`, it returns 'Yes', otherwise 'No'.

#### Function `func_2()`
- It reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` for each array.
- It collects the results and prints them.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary for `func_2` correctly describes its behavior: it reads input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to determine if each array can be sorted by rotations.

### Correctness Evaluation
Let's evaluate the logic of `func_1(a)`:
- **Concatenation and Subarray Check**: By concatenating `a` with itself, `concatenated_a` contains all possible rotations of `a` as its subarrays. This means that if `a` can be rotated to match `sorted_a`, there will be a subarray in `concatenated_a` that matches `sorted_a`.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Edge Cases
The program should correctly handle:
- Arrays that are already sorted.
- Arrays that can be sorted by a single rotation.
- Arrays that cannot be sorted by any number of rotations.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted by performing the specified prefix-suffix swaps. It handles multiple test cases and correctly checks for all possible rotations of the array by leveraging the concatenated array technique.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
