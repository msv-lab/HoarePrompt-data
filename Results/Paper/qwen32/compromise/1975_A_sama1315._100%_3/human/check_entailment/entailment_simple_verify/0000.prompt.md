You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: 'Yes'

    #The program returns 'No'

#Function 2:

def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1

        results.append(result)
        
    #State: - After the loop completes, `idx` will have been incremented by `1 + n1 + 1 + n2 + 1 + ... + nk + 1`, where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` in each iteration.
    #   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `a` will be the last list of integers processed in the loop.
    #   - `results` will contain the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration.
    #   - `data` remains unchanged as it is only read from, not modified.
    #
    #Thus, the output state can be described as:
    #- `a` is the last list of integers processed in the loop.
    #- `data` remains the same as the input.
    #- `idx` is incremented by `1 + n1 + 1 + n2 + 1 + ... + nk + 1` where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` in each iteration.
    #- `t` remains the same as the input.
    #- `results` contains the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration.
    #
    #Output State:
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: result1\nresult2\n...\nresultk (where result1, result2, ..., resultk are the results of func_1(a) for each iteration of the loop)




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Concatenation and Subarray Check**:
   - The function `func_1` concatenates the array `a` with itself, resulting in `concatenated_a`.
   - It then checks every possible subarray of length `n` within this concatenated array to see if it matches the sorted version of the original array `sorted_a`.
   - If any such subarray matches `sorted_a`, it means the array can be rotated in such a way that it becomes sorted.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it extracts the array `a`, calls `func_1` to determine if it can be sorted, and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints all the results.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles arrays of length 2 to 50, as specified in the problem description.
   - It correctly identifies arrays that are already sorted.
   - It correctly identifies arrays that can be sorted by a single rotation.
   - It correctly identifies arrays that cannot be sorted by any number of rotations.

No edge cases or potential inputs were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
