### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_1` accurately solves the problem described. The problem requires us to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more operations where we split the array into a prefix and suffix and swap them.

#### Key Points:
1. **Concatenation and Subarray Check:**
   - The program concatenates the array with itself (`concatenated_a = a + a`). This step is crucial because it allows us to check if any rotation of the array can be sorted.
   - It then checks for every possible starting point in this concatenated array if a subarray of length `n` (the original array length) matches the sorted version of the original array (`sorted_a`).

2. **Logic Verification:**
   - If there exists a subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a` that matches `sorted_a`, it means that the array can be rotated to become sorted. Hence, the program correctly returns 'Yes'.
   - If no such subarray exists, the program correctly returns 'No'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles arrays of length 2 and up to 50, as specified in the problem statement.
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases as per the provided example and the state annotations.

4. **State Annotations:**
   - The state annotations provided in the comments accurately describe the state of the program at various points, ensuring that the logic is correctly implemented and the program behaves as expected.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The concatenation and subarray check ensure that all possible rotations of the array are considered, and the results are accurately determined.

### Your Response:
Reasoning: The program correctly checks if the array can be rotated to become sorted by concatenating the array with itself and checking for a matching subarray of the sorted version of the array. The state annotations confirm the correctness of the logic and behavior of the program.
Correctness: **True**
