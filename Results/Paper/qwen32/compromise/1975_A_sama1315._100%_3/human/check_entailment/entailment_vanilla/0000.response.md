### Reasoning:

The problem asks whether the array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts (a prefix and a suffix) and the two parts are swapped. Essentially, this operation is equivalent to rotating the array in such a way that a suffix of the array can be moved to the front.

The given program uses a clever approach to solve this problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
    - It takes an array `a` and calculates its length `n`.
    - It creates a sorted version of the array, `sorted_a`.
    - It then concatenates the array with itself to form `concatenated_a`. This is done to simulate all possible rotations of the array.
    - The program then checks every possible "window" of length `n` in `concatenated_a` to see if it matches `sorted_a`. If any such window matches, it means that the array can be rotated to form a sorted array, and the function returns 'Yes'. If no such window is found, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - This function reads the input from standard input.
    - It parses the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
    - It calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations and stores the result.
    - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

### Verification:

Let's verify the given program against the example provided:

- **First Test Case**:
    - Input: `1 1 4 5 1 4`
    - Sorted version: `1 1 4 4 5`
    - Concatenated version: `1 1 4 5 1 4 1 1 4 5 1 4`
    - Checking all windows of length 6 in the concatenated version does not yield a match with the sorted version.
    - Output: `No`

- **Second Test Case**:
    - Input: `7 9 2 2 3`
    - Sorted version: `2 2 3 7 9`
    - Concatenated version: `7 9 2 2 3 7 9 2 2 3`
    - Checking all windows of length 5 in the concatenated version yields a match with the sorted version (`2 2 3 7 9`).
    - Output: `Yes`

- **Third Test Case**:
    - Input: `1 2 3`
    - Sorted version: `1 2 3`
    - Concatenated version: `1 2 3 1 2 3`
    - Checking all windows of length 3 in the concatenated version yields a match with the sorted version (`1 2 3`).
    - Output: `Yes`

The program correctly handles these test cases, and the logic appears to be sound. It efficiently checks all possible rotations of the array by leveraging the concatenated version of the array.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
