Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If `aa` contains exactly one unique element, then `aa` has a single element. Otherwise, the state of `aa` remains as a set containing unique elements from `a`.**
