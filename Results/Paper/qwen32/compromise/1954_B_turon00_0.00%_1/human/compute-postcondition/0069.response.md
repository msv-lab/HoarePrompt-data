Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the input integer `n`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been updated to the value of `n`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
