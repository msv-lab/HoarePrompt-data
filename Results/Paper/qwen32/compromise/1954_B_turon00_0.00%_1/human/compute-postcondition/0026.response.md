The code snippet `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. None of the other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.**
