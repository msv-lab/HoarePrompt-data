Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `n`. The current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**
