test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of three parts: (1) an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) representing the size of the array, (2) an integer x (1 <= x <= 10^9) representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers, (3) an integer y (1 <= y <= 10^9) representing the other favorite integer, and (4) a list a of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The total number of elements across all arrays in all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
