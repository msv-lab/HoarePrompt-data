The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the state. However, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since the loop is set to run `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented appropriately at the start of each iteration.

Given that the loop has just finished an iteration, the value of `t` must have been decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3**

To make it clearer, if `t` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 4 at the start of the next iteration. So, we can express the state as:

State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t - 1` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3**

Since we are not given the exact value of `t`, we can simply express it as `t` minus 1:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t - 1` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3**
