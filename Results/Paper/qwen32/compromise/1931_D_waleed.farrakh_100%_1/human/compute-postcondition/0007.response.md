The code snippet updates the `arr` variable by mapping the integers from the string `data[idx + 1]` and splitting it. Therefore, `arr` now holds the list of integers from `data[2]` (since `idx` is 1).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is an empty list, `idx` is 1**.
