Postcondition: **`rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `test_cases` must contain at least one more tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the single element `count`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[(rx, ry)]` is incremented by 1 and `count` is updated to `freq[(rx, ry)]`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq` is updated to include `(rx, ry)` with a value of `1`, and `count` remains unchanged.**
