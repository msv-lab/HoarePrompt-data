To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

The loop iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. The number of iterations is determined by the length of the `results` list. From the given information, we know that `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples derived from the `data` list, with each tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to iterate until all elements in `results` have been printed. Therefore, the final output state will be when all elements in `results` have been processed.

Since the loop simply prints each element in `results`, the final output state will reflect the state after all elements in `results` have been printed, meaning the loop will have finished executing.

Output State: **All elements in `results` have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, every element in the `results` list will have been printed, and the loop will terminate. The state of other variables like `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `data`, and `test_cases` will remain unchanged from their last values in the loop, except that the loop will no longer be active.
