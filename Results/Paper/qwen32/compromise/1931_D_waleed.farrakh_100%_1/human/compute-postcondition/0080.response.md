The code snippet assigns the tuple `(a % x, a % y)` to the variable `current_pair`. This affects the value of `current_pair` but does not change the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `rx`, or `ry`.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged; `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `count`; `freq` is an empty dictionary unless `(rx, ry)` exists as a key in `freq`, in which case `count` is incremented by `freq[rx, ry]`; `n` is `n_next`; `x` is `x_next`; `y` is `y_next`; `arr` is `arr_next` and must contain at least one element; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`**.
