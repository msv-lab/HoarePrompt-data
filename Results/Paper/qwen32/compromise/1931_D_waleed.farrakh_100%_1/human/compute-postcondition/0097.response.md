The code snippet provided is:
```
ry = a % y
```

This line of code updates the value of `ry` to be the result of `a % y`. The initial state specifies that `ry` is initially set to `a % y`, so this operation will reassign `ry` to the same value unless `a` or `y` has changed. However, based on the given initial state, `a` and `y` are specified as the next element in `arr_next` and `y_next` respectively, but there's no indication that they have changed since the last assignment of `ry`. Therefore, `ry` will retain its value unless there was an external change not captured in the initial state.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only variable that is affected is `ry`, and it remains `a % y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged; `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `count`; `freq` is a dictionary, and if `current_pair` was in `freq`, its value is incremented by 1, otherwise `freq` contains a new key-value pair `((a % x, a % y), 1)`; `n` is `n_next`; `x` is `x_next`; `y` is `y_next`; `arr` is `arr_next` and must contain at least two elements; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `a` is the next element in `arr_next`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is incremented by `freq[(rx, ry)]`.**
