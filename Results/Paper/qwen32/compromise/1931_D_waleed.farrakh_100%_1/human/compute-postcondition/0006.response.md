The code snippet updates the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` by mapping them to the integers from the string `data[idx]`. Given that `idx` is 1, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be assigned based on the string at `data[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]`, `arr` is a list of integers, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is an empty list, `idx` is 1**.
