The code snippet provided updates the `current_pair` variable to a new tuple based on the current value of `a`, `x`, and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged; `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to the old `count` plus `freq[(rx, ry)]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise both equal to the old `count`; `freq` is a dictionary, and if `current_pair` was in `freq`, its value is incremented by 1, otherwise `freq` contains a new key-value pair `((a % x, a % y), 1)`; `n` is `n_next`; `x` is `x_next`; `y` is `y_next`; `arr` is `arr_next` and must contain at least two elements; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `a` is the next element in `arr_next`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is incremented by `freq[(rx, ry)]`.**

In simpler terms, the `current_pair` has been updated to the new tuple `(a % x, a % y)`. All other variables retain their previous values.
