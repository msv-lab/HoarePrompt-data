### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which work together to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases.

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input from standard input.
   - Parses the input to extract the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - Constructs a list of tuples `test_cases` where each tuple contains `(n, x, y, arr)`.
   - Calls `func_1` with the list of test cases.
   - Prints the results returned by `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Iterates over each test case in the `test_cases` list.
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(rx, ry)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y`.
   - If the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before (exists in `freq`), it increments the `count` by the frequency of the pair.
   - Updates the frequency of the pair `(rx, ry)` in the `freq` dictionary.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Returns the `results` list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Explanation of the Logic:
- **Condition for a beautiful pair**:
  - `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
  - `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
- **Transforming the conditions**:
  - `a_i + a_j ≡ 0 (mod x)` can be transformed to `a_i ≡ -a_j (mod x)`.
  - `a_i - a_j ≡ 0 (mod y)` can be transformed to `a_i ≡ a_j (mod y)`.
- **Using remainders**:
  - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is the positive remainder of `-a` modulo `x`.
  - `ry = a % y` is the remainder of `a` modulo `y`.
- **Counting pairs**:
  - For each element `a` in the array, the program checks how many times the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before.
  - It updates the frequency of the current pair `(rx, ry)` for future comparisons.

### Verification:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case independently.
- It uses a dictionary to efficiently count the number of previously seen pairs of remainders, which allows it to determine the number of beautiful pairs in linear time for each test case.
- The logic of transforming the conditions into remainders and using a frequency dictionary is sound and aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct as it implements the logic required to solve the problem and produces the correct output for the given examples.
