### Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `t` for the number of test cases, but it does not loop through these test cases. Instead, it seems to read a single input string without processing multiple test cases.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Segment Length**:
   - The program identifies the index of the first 'B' from the start and the index of the last 'B' from the end.
   - It then calculates the length of the segment to be painted as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.
   - This calculation is incorrect. The correct approach is to find the minimum segment that spans all 'B's in the string. The length of this segment is the distance between the first and last 'B' plus one.

3. **Output**: The program does not output the correct result for the given problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, for each test case:
- Identify the index of the first 'B' from the start.
- Identify the index of the last 'B' from the end.
- The minimum segment length to paint all cells white is the distance between these two indices plus one.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        ind1 = s.find('B')
        ind2 = s.rfind('B')
        print(ind2 - ind1 + 1)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the provided program, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
