The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means `n` will hold the value of the integer input, and the other variables `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers a and b such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**
