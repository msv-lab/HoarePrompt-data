Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He tries to cut this rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes. Two rectangles differing only by a 90Â° rotation are considered the same. Bob needs to determine if he can obtain some other rectangle from the `a x b` rectangle.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Let's Evaluate the Conditions:
1. **Condition 1**: `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:`
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program outputs "NO". This is correct because if both dimensions are odd, you cannot cut the rectangle into two identical smaller rectangles with integer sides.

2. **Condition 2**: `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:`
   - If one dimension is exactly half of the other, the program outputs "NO". This is correct because if one dimension is exactly half of the other, cutting the rectangle along the longer side will result in two rectangles of size `a/2 x b` or `a x b/2`, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle different from the original.

3. **Else Case**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program outputs "YES". This is correct because if the dimensions are not both odd and one dimension is not exactly half of the other, it is always possible to cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `a = 1, b = 1`
  - Both dimensions are odd, so the output is "NO". Correct.
- **Test Case 2**: `a = 2, b = 1`
  - One dimension is even and the other is odd, and one is not half of the other, so the output is "NO". Correct.
- **Test Case 3**: `a = 2, b = 6`
  - One dimension is not half of the other, so the output is "YES". Correct.
- **Test Case 4**: `a = 3, b = 2`
  - One dimension is not half of the other, so the output is "YES". Correct.
- **Test Case 5**: `a = 2, b = 2`
  - Both dimensions are even and one is half of the other, so the output is "YES". Correct.
- **Test Case 6**: `a = 2, b = 4`
  - One dimension is exactly half of the other, so the output is "NO". Correct.
- **Test Case 7**: `a = 6, b = 3`
  - One dimension is exactly half of the other, so the output is "NO". Correct.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle all the provided test cases correctly. There are no edge cases that seem to be missed based on the problem description and the given examples.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all the described scenarios. If both dimensions are odd, it returns "NO". If one dimension is exactly half of the other, it returns "NO". In all other cases, it returns "YES", which aligns with the problem description.
