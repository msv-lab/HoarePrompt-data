Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct based on the annotated code and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then, he wants to see if he can form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.

### Key Observations:
1. **Cut Parallel to Sides:**
   - If Bob cuts parallel to the `a` side, he gets two rectangles of size `(a/2) x b` if `a` is even, or two rectangles of size `(a-1)/2 x b` and `1 x b` if `a` is odd.
   - If Bob cuts parallel to the `b` side, he gets two rectangles of size `a x (b/2)` if `b` is even, or two rectangles of size `a x (b-1)/2` and `a x 1` if `b` is odd.

2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - For the new rectangle to be different from the original, the resulting pieces must be able to be rearranged to form a rectangle with different dimensions.
   - If `a` and `b` are both odd, the resulting pieces will be `1 x b` and `(a-1) x b` or `a x 1` and `a x (b-1)`, which cannot form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
   - If one of `a` or `b` is even, the resulting pieces can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

3. **Special Cases:**
   - If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, the resulting pieces will be `a x (a/2)` or `(b/2) x b`, which are essentially the same rectangle as the original (rotated).

### Program Analysis:
Let's look at the provided program and compare it with the above observations.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

1. **Condition for Both Sides Odd:**
   - The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` correctly identifies cases where both `a` and `b` are odd, and in these cases, Bob cannot form a new rectangle. This part is correct.

2. **Condition for Half Dimensions:**
   - The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` correctly identifies cases where cutting the rectangle results in pieces that form the same rectangle (rotated). This part is also correct.

3. **Remaining Cases:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that either one of `a` or `b` is even, or the dimensions are not half of each other, allowing Bob to form a new rectangle. This part is correct.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points and align with the logic of the program. The annotations mention that the program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd, if one is half of the other, and if neither, it prints 'YES', which is consistent with the logic described in the problem analysis.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. The annotations verify that the logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
