Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some issues with the program:

1. The program incorrectly initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. It should start `count` at 1 and properly initialize `ans` to 0 or 1, depending on the case.

2. The logic inside the while loop is incorrect. The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` but does not correctly iterate over all possible pairs and check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. The program uses floating-point division (`/`), which can introduce precision errors and lead to incorrect results when the result is cast to an integer.

4. The program does not correctly handle all test cases. For example, it does not properly count the pairs for the given example inputs.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and then iterating over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`, checking the condition for each pair `(a, b)`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version properly iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition, counting the number of valid pairs for each test case. However, this approach might be too slow for the given constraints, and further optimization would be necessary for large inputs.
