Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions given in the problem description. Let's analyze why it is incorrect.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The program's logic seems to be incorrect for several reasons:
1. The program starts the count at 2 and initializes `ans` to `n`, which does not align with the problem's requirement.
2. The loop and conditions inside the loop do not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs.
3. The variable `g` is calculated as `n / count`, which does not match the required logic for checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's consider a simple test case to demonstrate the issue:

#### Test Case:
```
Input:
1
2 3
```

#### Expected Output:
```
3
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

#### Program Output:
The program does not produce the correct output for this test case.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This implementation correctly iterates through all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the required condition, ensuring that the count is accurate for all test cases.
