You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: t remains the same, i is equal to t, n and m hold the values from the last test case, count is m + 1 if the inner loop completes without breaking, and ans holds the final accumulated value for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes two positive integers `n` and `m`, and computes a specific value based on these inputs. It then prints the result for each test case. The result is an integer derived from an iterative calculation involving `n` and `m`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The program should correctly count such pairs for multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read.
   - `count` is initialized to 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which seems to be counting the number of valid pairs where `b = 1`.

2. **Loop through `b` values**:
   - The loop runs while `count` (representing `b`) is less than or equal to `m`.
   - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
   - `g` is set to `n / count`.
   - If `g < countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - `g` is updated to `g - countmins`.
   - `ans` is incremented by `g / count + 1`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - The final `ans` for each test case is printed.

### Issues in the Program

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on the given conditions. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Counting Pairs for b > 1**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that for each `b`, the number of valid `a` values can be computed in a simple manner using the formula `g / count + 1`, which does not correctly account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

2. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The initialization of `ans` to `n` assumes that all pairs where `b = 1` are valid, which is true, but the subsequent logic does not correctly handle the cases where `b > 1`.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop and the calculations inside it do not correctly reflect the logic needed to count the valid pairs for `b > 1`.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the program's logic, the program is not correct for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**

The program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for all test cases as described in the problem statement.
