Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The program is intended to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the logic in the provided program does not accurately reflect this requirement.

The program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`, then iterates while `count` is less than or equal to `m`. Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`, and `g` as `n / count`. It then checks if `g` is less than `countmins`, and if so, breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it adjusts `g` by subtracting `countmins` and adds `g / count + 1` to `ans`. This process does not correctly implement the logic needed to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true. The provided program does not do this.

Given the discrepancy between the problem description and the logic in the provided program, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
