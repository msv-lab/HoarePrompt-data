Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 2
    ans = n
    while count <= m:
        countmins = count - 1
        g = n / count
        if g < countmins:
            break
        g -= countmins
        ans += g / count + 1
        count += 1
    print(int(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `t` remains the same, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer from the input.
- `count` is `m + 1` (since the loop increments `count` until it exceeds `m`).
- `ans` is the final accumulated value after all iterations.

The final `ans` value is computed by summing up the contributions from each iteration of the loop.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - The loop will continue to execute until `count > m` or `g < countmins`.
   - The final value of `count` will be `m + 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
   - The final value of `ans` will be the sum of the initial `n` and the contributions from each iteration, as described above.

Given that the loop runs until `count` exceeds `m` or `g` becomes less than `countmins`, the final output state can be described as:

- `t` remains the same, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` remains 1
- `n` remains the first integer from the input
- `m` remains the second integer from the input
- `count` will be `m + 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking
- `ans` will be the sum of the initial `n` and the contributions from each iteration

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: - `t`: remains the same
- `i`: 2
- `n`: first input integer
- `m`: second input integer
- `count`: `m + 1`
- `ans`: updated based on the loop iterations until `count > m`

The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`. However, the general form of `ans` is the sum of the series calculated in each iteration until `count` exceeds `m`.

Output State:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
