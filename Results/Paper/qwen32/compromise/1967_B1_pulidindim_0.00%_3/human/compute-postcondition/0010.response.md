Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is `n / 2`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
