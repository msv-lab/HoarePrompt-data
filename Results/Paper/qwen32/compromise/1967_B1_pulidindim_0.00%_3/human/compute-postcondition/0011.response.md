The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`. Given the initial state, `g` is initially `n / 2` and `countmins` is 1. Therefore, after the operation, `g` becomes `(n / 2) - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is `(n / 2) - 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
