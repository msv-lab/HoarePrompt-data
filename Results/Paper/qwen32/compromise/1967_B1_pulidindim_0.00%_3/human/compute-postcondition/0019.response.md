The value of `g` is decreased by `countmins`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `g`. Since the initial value of `g` is `n / 3`, after the operation `g -= countmins`, the new value of `g` becomes `(n / 3) - countmins`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 4, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + (g / count) + 1`, and `g` is `(n / 3) - countmins`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
