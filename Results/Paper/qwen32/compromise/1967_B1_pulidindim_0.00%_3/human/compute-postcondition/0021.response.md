Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 4, `count` is 4, `g` is `(n / 3) - countmins`, `ans` is `n + 2 * (g / count) + 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `count` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables retain their initial values.
