Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than 4, `count` is 5, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / 5 - 3`, `ans` is `n + 2 * ((n / 5 - 3) / 5) + 2 + ((n / 5 - 3) / 5) + 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing it from 4 to 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and `g` and `ans` are recalculated based on the new value of `count`.
