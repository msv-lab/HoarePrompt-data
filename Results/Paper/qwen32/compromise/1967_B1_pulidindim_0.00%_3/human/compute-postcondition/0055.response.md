The code snippet provided updates the value of `g` to be `n / count`. Given that `count` is 4, the new value of `g` will be `n / 4`.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` remains the same, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `i` is 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` must be greater than 4; `count` is 4; `ans` is `n + 2 * n / 9`; `countmins` is 3; `g` is `n / 4`**.
