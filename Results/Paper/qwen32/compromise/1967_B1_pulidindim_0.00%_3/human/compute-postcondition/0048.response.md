Output State: **`t` remains the same, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `i` is 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` must be at least 4; `count` is 3; `ans` is the first integer from the input plus `g / count + 1`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3`. If `n / 3` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged, but the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
