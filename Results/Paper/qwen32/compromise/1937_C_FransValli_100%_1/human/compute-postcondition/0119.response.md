Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state to determine what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `maxi` is 5
- `arr` is [3, 7, 9]
- `res` is '>'

Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

In the code snippet, we see the following variables being printed: `mini`, `item`. However, these variables (`mini` and `item`) are not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact values of `mini` and `item`.

Since the values of `mini` and `item` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] and [item] are the values of the variables mini and item respectively)**
