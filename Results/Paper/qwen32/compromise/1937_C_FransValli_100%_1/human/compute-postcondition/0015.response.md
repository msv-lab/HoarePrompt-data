To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is `i + 1`. This implies that the value of `i` is being incremented by 1 from its previous value.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)`.
   - This means the string `'?'` will be printed first.
   - Then, the value of `maxi` will be printed twice.
   - Then, the value of `i` will be printed twice.
   - The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the console.

3. **Variables**:
   - `maxi`: This variable is not defined in the initial state, so we don't have an explicit value for it. The value of `maxi` will be whatever it was set to before this print statement.
   - `i`: Initially, `i` is `i + 1`, meaning `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value. We don't have the initial value of `i`, but we know it has been incremented.

Given this information, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where maxi is the value of maxi and i is the value of i incremented by 1 from its previous value)**
