The code snippet `arr.append(i)` modifies the list `arr` by adding the value of `i` to it. The other variables (`n`, `maxi`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is `[0, i]`; `res` is the value of the input string, and `res` is `'='`.**
