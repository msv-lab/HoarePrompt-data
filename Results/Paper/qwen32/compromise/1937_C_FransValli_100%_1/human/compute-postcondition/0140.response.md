To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `maxi` is 7 if `res` is '<', otherwise `maxi` remains 0.
- `arr` is [3, 7, 9].
- `mini` is 9.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values of the variables:
- The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`. Since `res` is not explicitly given, we can only determine `maxi` based on the condition. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 7; otherwise, `maxi` is 0. We'll consider the most precise description possible, so we'll include the condition in the output.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.

Thus, the print statement will output:
- The literal character '?'.
- The value of `maxi` (which is 7 if `res` is '<', otherwise 0).
- The value of `maxi` again (same as the previous one).
- The value of `i` which is 2.
- The value of `i` again which is 2.

Output: **? 7 7 2 2 (if res is '<')** or **? 0 0 2 2 (if res is not '<')**

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we must consider both possibilities. However, the most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **? maxi maxi 2 2 (where maxi is 7 if res is '<', otherwise 0)**
