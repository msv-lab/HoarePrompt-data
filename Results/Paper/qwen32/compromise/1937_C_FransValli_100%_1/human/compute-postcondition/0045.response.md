To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the final state of the variables `maxi` and `arr` after the loop completes. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, and in each iteration, it updates `maxi` and `arr` based on the input `res`.

**Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains all `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations:
- `maxi` will be the highest index `i` where the comparison result `res` was `'<'`.
- `arr` will contain the index `i` where `res` was last `'<'` and all indices `i` where `res` was `'='`.

Here is the formal output state:
Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains all `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`.**
