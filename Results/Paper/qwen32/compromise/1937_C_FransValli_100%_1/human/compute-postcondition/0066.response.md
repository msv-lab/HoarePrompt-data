The code snippet provided is simply reading an integer input and assigning it to the variable `n`. This does not affect the other variables (`maxi`, `arr`, `mini`) or their initial states. Therefore, the only change is that `n` is now assigned the value of the integer input.

Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is the input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains all `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`; `mini` is the smallest value in `arr` that is greater than all other elements in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`.**
