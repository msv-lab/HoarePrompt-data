To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **maxi**: The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is `'<'`, then `maxi` is set to 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0. Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we can only express `maxi` in terms of `res`.

2. **arr**: The list `arr` is explicitly given as `[3, 7, 9]`.

3. **mini**: The variable `mini` is explicitly given as `9`.

4. **n**: The variable `n` is described as being greater than 3, but its exact value is not provided.

5. **i**: The variable `i` is explicitly given as `3`.

6. **res**: This is an input string, and its exact value is not provided. However, it determines the value of `maxi`.

Given these initial conditions, let's look at the `print` statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```
Here, we are printing a literal `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi` twice, followed by the value of `i` twice.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `maxi`. However, we know that `maxi` will be either `2` if `res` is `'<'`, or `0` otherwise.

The value of `i` is explicitly given as `3`.

Thus, the output will depend on the value of `res`:
- If `res` is `'<'`, `maxi` will be `2`, and the output will be `? 2 2 3 3`.
- If `res` is not `'<'`, `maxi` will be `0`, and the output will be `? 0 0 3 3`.

Given the information provided, the most precise description of the output is:
Output: **? maxi maxi i i (where maxi is 2 if res is '<', otherwise maxi is 0, and i is 3)**
