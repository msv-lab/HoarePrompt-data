The provided Python code snippet only contains the assignment `maxi = 0`. This line sets the variable `maxi` to 0, without affecting any other variables or their values.

Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is the input integer; `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains all `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`; `mini` is the smallest value in `arr` that is greater than all other elements in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`.**
