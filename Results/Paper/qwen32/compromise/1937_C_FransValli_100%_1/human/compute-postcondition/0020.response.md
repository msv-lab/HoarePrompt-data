The code snippet provided initializes a list `arr` with a single element, which is `0`. The initial state of other variables such as `n`, `maxi`, and `res` are not affected by this line of code. The precondition regarding the number of test cases and the conditions for `maxi` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is `[0]`.**
