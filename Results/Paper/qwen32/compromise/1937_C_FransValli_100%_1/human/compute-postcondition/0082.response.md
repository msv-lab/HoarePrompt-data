The value of `maxi` is set to the current value of `i`. The values of `n` and `res` remain unchanged. Since `i` was incremented by 1 from its previous value, the new value of `i` is one more than its previous value. The condition that `n` is greater than `i` still holds because the increment of `i` does not make it greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i`, `res` is the value of the new user's input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `maxi` is equal to the new value of `i`.**
