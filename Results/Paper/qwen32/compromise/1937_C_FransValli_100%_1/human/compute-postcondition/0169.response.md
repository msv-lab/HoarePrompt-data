Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `maxi` is `n-1`
- `mini` is 9
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is `n-1`
- `res` is the user's input. 
  - If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` contains `i` as its last element.
  - Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.

### Variables:
- `maxi` and `i` both hold the value `n-1` because `maxi` is defined as `n-1` and `i` is also defined as `n-1`.
- The value of `arr[0]` depends on the initial state of `arr` before the print statement. Since there is no specific information about the initial state of `arr` except for the condition that if `res` equals '=', `i` (which is `n-1`) is added to the end of `arr`, we can't determine the value of `arr[0]` precisely without additional information. However, we can denote it as `arr[0]`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

Given that `maxi` and `i` both hold the value `n-1`, and `arr[0]` is the first element of `arr`, the output will be:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is `n-1`.
- `arr[0]` is the first element of `arr`.
- `maxi` again is `n-1`.
- `i` again is `n-1`.

### Output:
Output: **? [n-1] [arr[0]] [n-1] [n-1] (where arr[0] is the first element of the arr list)**

This output reflects the values of the variables as described in the initial state.
