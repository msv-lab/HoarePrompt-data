To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its effect on the variables.

### Initial State:
- `maxi` is `n-1`
- `arr` is `[0]`
- `mini` is `9`
- `n` is the same as the input integer

### Loop Execution:
The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration, the following happens:
1. It prints a query: `?, maxi, arr[0], maxi, i`
2. It waits for user input (`res`).
3. If `res` is `'<'`, it sets `arr` to `[i]`.
4. If `res` is `'='`, it appends `i` to `arr`.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes, `i` will have taken all values from `1` to `n-1`. The variable `maxi` remains `n-1` throughout the loop as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `mini` remains `9` as well. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

The key variable to focus on is `arr`. The final state of `arr` depends on the user inputs (`res`) for each iteration:
- If `res` is `'<'` for any `i`, `arr` will be set to `[i]` at that point, and any subsequent `'='` responses will not change `arr` because it will be overwritten.
- If `res` is `'='` for any `i`, `i` will be appended to `arr`.

Given that the loop runs `n-1` times, the final state of `arr` will be:
- `[n-1]` if the last response (`res` for `i = n-1`) was `'<'`.
- `[0, i1, i2, ..., in-1]` if all responses were `'='`, where `i1, i2, ..., in-1` are the values of `i` from `1` to `n-1`.

However, since the loop only appends to `arr` when `res` is `'='`, and sets `arr` to `[i]` when `res` is `'<'`, the final `arr` will be:
- `[n-1]` if the last response was `'<'`.
- `[0]` if all responses were `'='` except possibly the last one, but the last one was not `'<'`.
- `[0, i1, i2, ..., in-1]` if all responses were `'='`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact responses, the most general form of the final `arr` is that it will contain all indices `i` for which `res` was `'='`, and if the last `res` was `'<'`, it will be `[n-1]`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state of the loop will be:
- `maxi` remains `n-1`.
- `mini` remains `9`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `arr` will be `[n-1]` if the last response was `'<'`, otherwise it will be `[0]` or `[0, i1, i2, ..., in-1]` depending on the responses.

Given the problem constraints and the loop behavior, the most definitive final state of `arr` without specific responses is `[0]` if no `'<'` response was given at the last iteration, and `[n-1]` if the last response was `'<'`.

Output State: **maxi is n-1, mini is 9, n is the same as the input integer, arr is [n-1] if the last response was '<', otherwise arr is [0] or [0, i1, i2, ..., in-1] depending on the responses.**

However, since the problem asks for a definitive output state and considering the most common and definitive final state without specific responses, we can state:

Output State: **maxi is n-1, mini is 9, n is the same as the input integer, arr is [0] or [n-1] depending on the last response.**
