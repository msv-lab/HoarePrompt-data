The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop will execute because the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `maxi` is 0
- `arr` is [3, 7, 9]
- `mini` is 9
- `n` is an input integer

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The values of `maxi`, `arr`, and `mini` do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`maxi` is 0, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], `mini` is 9, `n` must be greater than 1**
