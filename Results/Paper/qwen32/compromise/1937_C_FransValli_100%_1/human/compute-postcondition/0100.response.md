The code snippet `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `arr`. 

Given the initial state:
- `maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.
- `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, and `[0]` otherwise.
- `n` is `2`.
- `res` is the user's input string.

The value of `arr` will be updated by appending `i` to it. Therefore, the new state of `arr` will be:
- If `arr` was `[i]`, it becomes `[i, i]`.
- If `arr` was `[0, i]`, it becomes `[0, i, i]`.
- If `arr` was `[0]`, it becomes `[0, i]`.

The values of `maxi`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is either `[i, i]`, `[0, i, i]`, or `[0, i]` depending on the initial state of `arr`; `n` is `2`; `res` is the user's input string.**
