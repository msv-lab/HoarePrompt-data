In the given task, the loop will execute based on the value of `n` in the `range(1, n)` function. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 1 and will iterate up to, but not including, `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. The state of `maxi` is not relevant to the execution of the loop itself, as it is not part of the loop's head.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means the loop will start with `i` equal to 1 and continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute because the range will be empty.
3. **Adjustable Variables**: We can only adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. However, `i` is initialized within the range function and does not need to be set beforehand. The only adjustable variable that affects the loop's execution is `n`.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is 0.**
