Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **maxi**: This variable holds the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists. Since there's no information provided about any responses or iterations, we assume the initial value is `0`.
2. **arr**: This is a list containing a single element, `0`.
3. **n**: This variable is set to `2`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```
Let's evaluate each part:
- `'?'`: This is a string literal and will be printed as is.
- **maxi**: As per the initial state, `maxi` is `0`.
- **arr[0]**: This refers to the first (and only) element of the list `arr`, which is `0`.
- **maxi**: This is the same variable as before, so it will also be `0`.
- **i**: The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since it is not initialized or given any value, it would raise a `NameError` if the code were to be executed. However, for the sake of this task, we will assume that `i` is not defined and should be treated as an undefined variable. But since the task requires a precise description, we'll assume it's a placeholder or a typo and infer it might be intended to be `maxi` or `n` based on context, but since no context is given, we'll leave it as undefined.

Since `i` is undefined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. However, for the sake of providing a precise description, we'll assume it's intended to be `maxi` or `n`. Given the lack of additional context, we'll assume `i` is intended to be `maxi` for this task.

### Final Output:
Given the above assumptions and the initial state:
- `'?'` is printed as is.
- `maxi` is `0`.
- `arr[0]` is `0`.
- `maxi` is `0` again.
- `i` is assumed to be `maxi`, which is `0`.

Thus, the final output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
