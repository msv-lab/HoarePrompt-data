The `print` statement includes the string `'!'`, the variable `maxi`, and the variable `mini`. According to the initial state, `maxi` is explicitly given as 5 and `mini` is explicitly given as 9. The `flush=True` argument in the `print` statement ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the console, but it does not affect the content of the output.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'!'` followed by the values of `maxi` and `mini`.

Output: **! 5 9**
