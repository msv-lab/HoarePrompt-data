The code assigns the value of `i` to `maxi`. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the value of the user's input and currently is `'<'`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value, but we know `maxi` will take this value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `res` is `'<'`; `maxi` is the value of `i`.**
