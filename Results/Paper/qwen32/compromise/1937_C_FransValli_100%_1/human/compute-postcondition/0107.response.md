The code appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` could be `[i]`, `[0, i]`, or `[0]` depending on the value of `res`. After appending `i`, the new state of `arr` will be `[i, i]`, `[0, i, i]`, or `[0, i]` respectively. The values of `maxi`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is `[i, i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i, i]` if `res` is `'='`, and `[0, i]` otherwise; `n` is `2`; `res` is the user's input string.**
