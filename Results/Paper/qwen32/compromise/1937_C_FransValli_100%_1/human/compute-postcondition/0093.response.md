The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `i`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `arr`. However, we know that the list `arr` will now have an additional element, which is `i`. The values of `maxi`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is `[0, i]`; `n` is 2; `res` is an input string that is `'='`**.
