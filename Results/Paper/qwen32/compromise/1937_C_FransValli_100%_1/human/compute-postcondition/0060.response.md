The code snippet `res = input()` reads a new value from the input and assigns it to the variable `res`. This changes the value of `res` but does not affect the other variables (`n`, `maxi`, `arr`, `item`).

Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains at least two elements where the first element is `mini` and the rest are `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`; if the current value of `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is updated to the current `item`; `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`; `res` is the new input string.**
