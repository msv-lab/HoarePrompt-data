The code snippet `arr = [i]` assigns a new list containing the single element `i` to the variable `arr`. This means the previous value of `arr` is overwritten. The values of `maxi`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is `[i]`; `n` is `2`; `res` is the user's input string.**
