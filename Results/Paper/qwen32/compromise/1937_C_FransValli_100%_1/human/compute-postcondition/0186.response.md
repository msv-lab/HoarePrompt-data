The code snippet provided is:
```python
res = input()
```
This line of code assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `res`. The `input()` function reads a line from input, converts it into a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that. The other variables (`maxi`, `mini`, `n`, `arr`, `item`) are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is the value of `res`, which is now the string input by the user.

Output State: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is either `0` or `n-1` or `item` if `res` equals `'>'`, `n` is the same as the input integer, `arr` has at least two elements, and `res` is the string input by the user.**
