The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop will start with `i` initialized to 1.
2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

The values of `maxi`, `arr`, and `mini` do not affect whether the loop executes, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `arr` is [0], `mini` is 9, `n` must be greater than 1**
