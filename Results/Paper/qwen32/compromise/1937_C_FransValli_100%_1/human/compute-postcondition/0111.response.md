`mini` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`. The values of `maxi` and the contents of `arr` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the response was `'='`, or the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'` if no `'='` responses were given; `mini` is `arr[0]`.**
