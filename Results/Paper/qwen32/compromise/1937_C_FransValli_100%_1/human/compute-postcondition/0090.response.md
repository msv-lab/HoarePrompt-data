The code `arr = [i]` assigns a new list containing the value of `i` to `arr`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but since it is used to update `arr`, we need to acknowledge that `arr` now holds this new value. The other variables (`maxi`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is `[i]`; `n` is 2; `res` is `'<'`**.
