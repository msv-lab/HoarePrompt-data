Functionality: **The function interacts with the environment to query up to 3n times for each test case, comparing the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in a secret permutation of length n. Based on these queries, it identifies and returns a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation is maximized.**
