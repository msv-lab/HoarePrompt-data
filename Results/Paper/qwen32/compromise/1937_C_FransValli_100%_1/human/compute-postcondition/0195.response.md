To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `maxi` is defined as `n-1`.
- `mini` is defined as the maximum value of `item` for which the response is `'>'` during the iterations.
- `n` is the same as the input integer.
- `arr` retains its initial value, but it is not directly used in the print statement.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

We need to determine the values of `maxi` and `mini` based on the initial state:

1. **Value of `maxi`**:
   - `maxi` is explicitly defined as `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `maxi` will be the input integer `n` minus 1.

2. **Value of `mini`**:
   - `mini` is defined as the maximum value of `item` for which the response is `'>'` during the iterations.
   - Since the exact iterations and the values of `item` are not provided, we can only describe `mini` in terms of the condition given.
   - `mini` will be the maximum `item` value that results in a `'>'` response during these iterations.

Since the exact value of `mini` depends on the specific iterations and the responses obtained, we describe it in terms of the condition.

Putting this together, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **! [n-1] mini (where mini is the maximum value of item for which the response is '>' during the iterations)**
