To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved:

1. **`maxi`**: This variable holds the highest value of `i` for which the response `res` was `'<'`. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` is `0`.

2. **`arr`**: The contents of `arr` depend on the value of `res`:
   - If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`.
   - If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`.
   - Otherwise, `arr` is `[0]`.

3. **`n`**: This is given as `2`.

4. **`res`**: This is an input string which can be either `'<'`, `'='`, or something else.

5. **`i`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to infer its value based on the context. Given that `maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which `res` was `'<'`, we can assume that `i` is some integer value that could have been used in determining `maxi`.

Now, let's break down the `print` statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```
- `'?'`: This is a literal string.
- `maxi`: This is the highest value of `i` for which `res` was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.
- `arr[0]`: This is the first element of the list `arr`. Depending on the value of `res`:
  - If `res` is `'<'`, `arr[0]` is `i`.
  - If `res` is `'='`, `arr[0]` is `0`.
  - Otherwise, `arr[0]` is `0`.
- `maxi`: This is repeated, so it will be the same value as the first `maxi`.
- `i`: This is the value of `i` that was used in determining `maxi`.

Given the lack of specific values for `res` and `i`, we can describe the output in terms of these variables:

- If `res` is `'<'`, `maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which `res` was `'<'`, and `arr[0]` is `i`.
- If `res` is `'='`, `maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which `res` was `'<'` (or `0` if no such `i` exists), and `arr[0]` is `0`.
- If `res` is something else, `maxi` is `0` and `arr[0]` is `0`.

Since `i` is not explicitly defined, we can't provide a specific numerical value for it, but we can describe it as the value that was used in determining `maxi`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? maxi arr[0] maxi i (where maxi is the highest value of i for which res was '<' or 0 if no such i exists, arr[0] is i if res is '<', 0 if res is '=', or 0 otherwise, and i is the value used in determining maxi)**
