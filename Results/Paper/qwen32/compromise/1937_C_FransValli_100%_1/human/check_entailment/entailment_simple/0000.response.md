### Reasoning:

The given program aims to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) in a permutation \( p \) such that the bitwise XOR \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. The strategy employed by the program involves making queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.

1. **Finding the Maximum Element (`maxi`)**:
   - The program iterates through the permutation and uses queries of the form `? maxi maxi i i` to find the maximum element in the permutation. This works because the bitwise OR of a number with itself is the number itself, and comparing it with another number will reveal which one is larger.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it implies that the current element `i` is larger than the current `maxi`, so `maxi` is updated to `i`.

2. **Finding Candidates (`arr`)**:
   - After identifying the maximum element (`maxi`), the program finds all elements that have the same bitwise OR with `maxi` as `maxi` itself. This is done using queries of the form `? maxi arr[0] maxi i`.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it means `i` is a better candidate than the current `arr[0]`, so `arr` is updated to `[i]`.
   - If the result of the query is `=`, it means `i` is another candidate, so `i` is appended to `arr`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Element Among Candidates (`mini`)**:
   - Among the candidates stored in `arr`, the program finds the minimum element using queries of the form `? mini mini item item`.
   - If the result of the query is `>`, it means `item` is smaller than the current `mini`, so `mini` is updated to `item`.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Finally, the program outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the pair that maximizes the bitwise XOR.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The approach is based on the observation that the maximum XOR value between any two numbers in a permutation is achieved when one number is the maximum and the other is the minimum among the candidates that have the same bitwise OR with the maximum.
  - This method ensures that the program can identify the required pair within the allowed number of queries (3n).

- **Query Count**:
  - The program makes \( n-1 \) queries to find `maxi`.
  - It then makes up to \( n-1 \) queries to find the candidates (`arr`).
  - Finally, it makes up to \( n-1 \) queries to find `mini` among the candidates.
  - Therefore, the total number of queries is at most \( 3(n-1) \), which is within the allowed limit of \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the strategy to find the pair of indices that maximize the bitwise XOR within the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
