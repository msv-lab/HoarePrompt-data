#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        
        res = a.count(a[p])
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: t is unchanged from its initial value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers, sorts the list, and prints the count of the median element in the sorted list.
