The code snippet sets the value at index `s` of the list `vis` to 1. This means that the element in `vis` at the position `s` is now marked as 1, indicating that it has been visited. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation, `s` is `p[p[S - 1]]` where `P_S - 1` is not equal to `P_B - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `mx` is `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`, `cur` is `2 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is `1` and at index `s` where it is `1`.**
