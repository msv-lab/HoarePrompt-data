The code sets the value of `vis[s]` to 1. This means the element at index `s` in the list `vis` is now 1. All other elements of `vis` remain unchanged, and the values of `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `mx`, and `cur` are also unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation, `s` is `p[P_S - 1]` where `P_S - 1` is not equal to `P_B - 1`, `k` is greater than 0, `mx` is `max(0, cur + k * a[s])`, `cur` is `a[s]`, `vis` is a list of n zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is 1 and at index `s` where it is 1.**
