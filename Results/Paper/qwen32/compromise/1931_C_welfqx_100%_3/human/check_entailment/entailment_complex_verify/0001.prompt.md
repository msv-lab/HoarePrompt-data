You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and the final values of the variables will reflect the last test case processed. The output will be a series of results printed for each test case, which is `n - max(cn, ck)` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the value `n - max(cn, ck)`, where `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of the list that consists of identical elements, and `ck` is the length of the longest prefix of the reversed list that consists of identical elements. If all elements in the list are the same, it prints `0`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation. The operation allows us to select a contiguous subarray and assign all its elements the same value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray. We need to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. Checks if all elements in the array are already the same. If yes, the cost is 0.
2. Otherwise, it finds the longest prefix of the array with all identical elements (`cn`).
3. It also finds the longest suffix of the array with all identical elements (`ck`).
4. If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it adds the lengths of the longest prefix and suffix.
5. Finally, it prints the cost as `n - max(cn, ck)`.

### Issues in the Program:
The program's logic is flawed. It only considers the longest prefix and suffix of identical elements and assumes that the optimal solution will involve making either the entire prefix or suffix uniform. However, this is not always the case. There might be a better solution that involves selecting a subarray in the middle of the array.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```
- The longest prefix with identical elements is `1` (length 1).
- The longest suffix with identical elements is `1` (length 1).
- The first and last elements are the same, so the program calculates `cn + ck = 2`.
- The program then calculates the cost as `5 - max(2, 2) = 3`.

However, the optimal solution is to select the subarray `[2, 3, 2]` and assign all elements to `2`, which costs `3 - 1 = 2`. Alternatively, selecting the subarray `[3]` and assigning all elements to `3` costs `1`, but the problem allows only one operation, and the optimal solution here is to make the whole array `2` by selecting `[2, 3, 2]`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always find the correct minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
