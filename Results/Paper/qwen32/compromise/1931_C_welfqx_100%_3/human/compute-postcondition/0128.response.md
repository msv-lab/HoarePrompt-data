The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`, which means `n` will be reassigned to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`f`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`, `cn`, and `r`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Given that `ck` was initially set to `n`, and `n` is being reassigned, `ck` will now hold the previous value of `n` before the reassignment. So, `ck` will be `1` (the initial value of `n`).

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 1; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. Additionally, if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is increased by the initial value of `n` (which is 1); `r` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**
