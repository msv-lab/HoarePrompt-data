Output State: **`f` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers from the input, `onum` is the reversed list of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `r` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `j` is 0, and `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `f` has been changed to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
