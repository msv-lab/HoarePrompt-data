The code snippet contains only a `break` statement, which will exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. However, since there is no loop or conditional block provided in the context, the `break` statement will not have any effect on the variables or the program flow. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `i` is 0. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` is 1.**
