Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state provided:

### Initial State Recap:
- `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0.
- `n` is the input integer and is either 1 or `f` is 1.
- `num` is a list of integers from the input.
- `onum` is the reversed list of `num`.
- `symb1` is the first element of `num`.
- `symb2` is the last element of `num`.
- `ck` is 1.
- `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.
- `r` is the initial value of `r` plus the number of iterations completed by the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(0)` statement is straightforward. It prints the integer `0` regardless of the values of the other variables (`f`, `n`, `num`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`). The value to be printed is explicitly provided as `0`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the integer `0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
