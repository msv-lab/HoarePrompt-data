The code snippet provided is `symb1 = num[0]`. This line assigns the first element of the list `num` to the variable `symb1`. Given that `symb1` was already defined as the first element of `num` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `symb1`. Therefore, the state of `symb1` remains the same as it was initially.

The other variables (`f`, `n`, `num`, `onum`, `symb2`, `ck`, `cn`, and `r`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is the input integer and is either 1 or `f` is 1; `num` is a list of integers from the input; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 1; `cn` is 1; `r` is the initial value of `r` plus the number of iterations completed by the loop.**
