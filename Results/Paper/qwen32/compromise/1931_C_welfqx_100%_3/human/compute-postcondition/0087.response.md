The code snippet reverses the list `onum`. The values of `f` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `onum` will now contain the elements of `num` in reverse order.

Output State: **`f` is 1 if all consecutive elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0; `n` is either 1 or `f` is 1; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`.**
