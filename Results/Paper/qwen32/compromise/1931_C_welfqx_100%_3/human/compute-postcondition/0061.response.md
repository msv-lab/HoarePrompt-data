The code snippet `cn += ck` adds the value of `ck` to the variable `cn`. The values of `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2` remain unchanged, but `cn` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and `ck`.

Output State: **`ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `onum[0]` up to `onum[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found; `symb1` is equal to `symb2`; `cn` is the previous value of `cn` plus `ck`.**
