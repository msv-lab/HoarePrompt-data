The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given the initial state, none of the variables are affected by the `continue` statement as there is no code following it to be skipped or modified. Therefore, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0; `n` is the input integer and is either 1 or `f` is 1; `num` is a list of integers from the input; `onum` is the reversed list of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 1; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`; `r` is the initial value of `r` plus the number of iterations completed by the loop.**
