The code snippet `ck += 1` increments the value of `ck` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `ck`, we can assume that `ck` is being incremented from whatever its previous value was. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`f` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers from the input, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `r` is the initial value of `r` plus (n - 1), `ii` is 2, `ck` is incremented by 1**.
