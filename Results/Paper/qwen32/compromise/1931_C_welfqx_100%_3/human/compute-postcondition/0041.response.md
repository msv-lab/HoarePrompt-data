The code snippet `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. Given the initial state, if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` was initially set to 2; otherwise, it was set to 1. After the increment, `cn` will be either 3 or 2, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `i` is 0. `cn` is either 2 or 3.**
