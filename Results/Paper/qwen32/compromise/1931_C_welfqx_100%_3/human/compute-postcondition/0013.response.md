Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is incremented by 1. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, then `f` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
