Postcondition: **`f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0; `n` is the input integer and is either 1 or `f` is 1; `num` is a list of integers from the input; `onum` is the reversed list of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 1; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`; `r` is the initial value of `r` plus the number of iterations completed by the loop.**
