The code snippet `symb1 = num[0]` assigns the first element of the list or string `num` to the variable `symb1`. This does not affect the values of `f`, `n`, `onum`, `cn`, or `ck`.

Given that `num` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume `num` is a sequence (like a list or string) and `num[0]` refers to its first element.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is either 1 or `f` is 1; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `cn` is 1; `ck` is 1; `symb1` is the first element of `num`.**
