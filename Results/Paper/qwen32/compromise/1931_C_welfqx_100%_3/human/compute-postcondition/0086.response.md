The code snippet `onum = num.copy()` creates a copy of the list `num` and assigns it to the variable `onum`. This means that `onum` now holds the same values as `num` at the time of copying. The values of `f` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1 if all consecutive elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0; `n` is either 1 or `f` is 1; `onum` is a copy of `num`.**
