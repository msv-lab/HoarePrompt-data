The code snippet `ck += 1` increments the value of `ck` by 1. Since the initial state does not provide a value for `ck`, we can only state that its value has increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is greater than 4; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ii` is 4; `ck` is increased by 1.**
