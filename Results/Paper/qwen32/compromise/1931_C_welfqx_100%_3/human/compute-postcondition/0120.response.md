Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is greater than 5; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ii` is 5 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
