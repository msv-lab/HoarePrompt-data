The code snippet `cn += 1` increments the value of the variable `cn` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `cn` will be 2 since it was initially 1.

Output State: **`f` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `num` is a list of integers from the input, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 2, `r` is the initial value of `r` plus the number of iterations completed by the loop, and `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`.**
