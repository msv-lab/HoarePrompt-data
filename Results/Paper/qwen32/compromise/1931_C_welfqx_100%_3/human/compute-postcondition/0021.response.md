Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1.**

In this case, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. The loop (if we are inside one) continues to the next iteration, but the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, and `f` remain unchanged.
