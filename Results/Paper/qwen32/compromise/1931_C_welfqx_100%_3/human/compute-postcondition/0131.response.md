To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is the `j` variable in the `range(n - 1)`.

The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. The other variables (`f`, `num`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`, `cn`, and `r`) do not affect whether the loop can execute because they are not part of the loop head.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`f` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers from the input, `onum` is the reversed list of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `r` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `j` is 0**
