The code snippet reverses the list `onum`. Since `onum` is a copy of `num`, reversing `onum` does not affect `num`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, and `f` remain unchanged. The only change is that `onum` is now the reversed version of its initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`**.
