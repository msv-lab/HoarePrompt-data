The code snippet provided is `ck += 1`, which increments the value of the variable `ck` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `ck` can have two possible initial values based on the conditions described:
1. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, `ck` is initially 3.
2. Otherwise, `ck` is initially 2.

In either case, after executing `ck += 1`, `ck` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `ck` will be 4 if it was initially 3, or 3 if it was initially 2.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `num[0]` up to `num[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found, `ck` is 4 if initially 3, otherwise `ck` is 3, and `i` is `n - 2` if all elements are equal, otherwise the index where the inequality is found, `ii` is `ii + 1`.**
