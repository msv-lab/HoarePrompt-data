The code snippet creates a copy of the list `num` and assigns it to the variable `onum`. This means `onum` will have the same values as `num` at the time of copying. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, and `f`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is a copy of `num`**.
