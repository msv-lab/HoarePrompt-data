Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `i` is `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid except for the additional information that the loop or if statement has been exited.
