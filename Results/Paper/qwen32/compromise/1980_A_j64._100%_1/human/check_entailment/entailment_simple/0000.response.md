Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem by first counting the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the given set of problems. It does this by initializing a list `count` of size 7 (for the 7 difficulty levels) and then iterating through the input string `a` to increment the appropriate index in `count` for each problem.

After counting the frequencies, the program calculates how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level. Specifically, for each difficulty level, if the current count is less than `m`, it adds the difference `(m - count[i])` to `needed_problems`. This ensures that each difficulty level is represented at least `m` times across all rounds.

The function `func_1` returns `needed_problems`, which is the minimum number of additional problems required to meet the requirement of having at least one problem of each difficulty level for each of the `m` rounds.

The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement, and the logic within `func_1` correctly computes the desired result based on the given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
