Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly account for the fact that each round requires one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. The current implementation calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level independently, which is incorrect. Instead, it should ensure that for each round, there is at least one problem of each difficulty level.

Here's the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        # For each difficulty level, we need at least m problems
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
    return needed_problems
```

However, the logic still needs to be adjusted to ensure that we need at least `m` problems for each difficulty level across all rounds. The correct approach is to ensure that the count of each difficulty level is at least `m` and sum up the differences.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    print(func_1(n, m, a))

def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        # We need at least m problems of each difficulty level
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
    return needed_problems
```

The logic is correct now, so the original program is incorrect due to the misunderstanding of the problem requirements. Thus, the response is:

Correctness: **False**
