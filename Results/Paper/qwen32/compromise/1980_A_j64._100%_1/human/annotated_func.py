#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5. a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
        
    #State: count is a list of 7 integers where each index i represents the frequency of the character chr(i + ord('A')) in the string a. All other variables remain unchanged.

    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
        
    #State: `count` is a list of 7 integers where each index i represents the frequency of the character chr(i + ord('A')) in the string a; `needed_problems` is the sum of (m - count[i]) for all i where count[i] < m.
    return needed_problems
    #The program returns needed_problems which is the sum of (m - count[i]) for all i where count[i] < m.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates and returns the total number of additional occurrences needed for each character in the string `a` to reach at least `m` occurrences, where `a` consists of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
