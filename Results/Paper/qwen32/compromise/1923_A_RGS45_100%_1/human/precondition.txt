test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
