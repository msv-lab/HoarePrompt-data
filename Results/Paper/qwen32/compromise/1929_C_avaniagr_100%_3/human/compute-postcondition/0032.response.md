The code snippet splits the input string `s` into three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. Therefore, the variable `s` is no longer needed after this operation. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the respective integer values extracted from `s`. The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the input string `s`.**
