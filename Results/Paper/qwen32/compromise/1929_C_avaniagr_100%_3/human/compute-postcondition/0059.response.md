In this task, we are given the initial state and a Python code snippet containing a `print` statement. The initial state describes the variables and how they are defined. Let's analyze the provided information step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `s` is the next input string from the file.
2. `t` remains unchanged.
3. `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the new `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement is a straightforward print statement that outputs the literal string `'YES'`.
- The variables `s`, `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are not used in the print statement.
- Since the print statement does not reference any of the variables defined in the initial state, their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
