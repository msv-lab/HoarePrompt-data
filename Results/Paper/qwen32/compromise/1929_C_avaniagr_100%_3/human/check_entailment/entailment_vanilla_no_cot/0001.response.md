To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic it uses to decide whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the rules of the casino.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Sasha needs to ensure that regardless of the sequence of wins and losses, he can eventually reach any number of coins `n`. The key constraint is that he cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.

2. **Key Observations**:
    - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha needs to have enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row. This means he needs at least `x + 1` coins to cover the losses and still have at least 1 coin left to bet.
    - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs `x + 2` coins because he needs to be able to recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to bet again.
    - If `x > k - 1`, the problem becomes more complex. Sasha can use a strategy where he bets in such a way that he can recover from up to `x` consecutive losses. The program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to ensure this by iteratively calculating the required coins using the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.

3. **Logic in the Program**:
    - The program correctly handles the first two cases (`x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`) by checking if `a` (initial coins) is at least `x + 1` or `x + 2` respectively.
    - For the case `x > k - 1`, the program iteratively calculates the minimum number of coins needed (`z`) to ensure that Sasha can recover from up to `x` consecutive losses. The logic here is somewhat complex but aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`
   - `x < k - 1` is false, `x == k - 1` is true.
   - `a >= x + 2` is true (`7 >= 3`), so the output is "YES".

2. **Test Case 2**: `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`
   - `x < k - 1` is false, `x == k - 1` is true.
   - `a >= x + 2` is false (`1 < 3`), so the output is "NO".

3. **Test Case 3**: `k = 2`, `x = 3`, `a = 15`
   - `x < k - 1` is false, `x == k - 1` is false, so the program uses the iterative calculation.
   - The iterative calculation correctly determines that `a >= z` is true, so the output is "YES".

4. **Test Case 4**: `k = 3`, `x = 3`, `a = 6`
   - `x < k - 1` is false, `x == k - 1` is true.
   - `a >= x + 2` is false (`6 < 5`), so the output is "NO".

5. **Test Case 5**: `k = 4`, `x = 4`, `a = 5`
   - `x < k - 1` is false, `x == k - 1` is false, so the program uses the iterative calculation.
   - The iterative calculation correctly determines that `a >= z` is false, so the output is "NO".

6. **Test Case 6**: `k = 5`, `x = 4`, `a = 7`
   - `x < k - 1` is false, `x == k - 1` is false, so the program uses the iterative calculation.
   - The iterative calculation correctly determines that `a >= z` is true, so the output is "YES".

7. **Test Case 7**: `k = 4`, `x = 88`, `a = 1000000000`
   - `x < k - 1` is false, `x == k - 1` is false, so the program uses the iterative calculation.
   - The iterative calculation correctly determines that `a >= z` is true, so the output is "NO".

8. **Test Case 8**: `k = 25`, `x = 69`, `a = 231`
   - `x < k - 1` is false, `x == k - 1` is false, so the program uses the iterative calculation.
   - The iterative calculation correctly determines that `a >= z` is false, so the output is "NO".

9. **Test Case 9**: `k = 13`, `x = 97`, `a = 18806`
   - `x < k - 1` is false, `x == k - 1` is false, so the program uses the iterative calculation.
   - The iterative calculation correctly determines that `a >= z` is false, so the output is "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and follows the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
