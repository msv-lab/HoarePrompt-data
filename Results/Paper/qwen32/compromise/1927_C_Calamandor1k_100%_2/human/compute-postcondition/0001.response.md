The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` and the list `cases`. For the loop to execute, `cases` must contain at least one tuple. Therefore, we need to ensure that `cases` is not empty and contains at least one valid tuple that meets the specified constraints.

Hereâ€™s the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b) where 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 <= b_j <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list**
