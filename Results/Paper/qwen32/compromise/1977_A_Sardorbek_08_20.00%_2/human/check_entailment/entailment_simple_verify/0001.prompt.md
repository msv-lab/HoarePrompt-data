You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `a` is the same as the initial input integer, `b` and `c` are the integers from the last iteration of the loop, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)` from the last iteration. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add one cube or remove one cube from the tower.

The key observation here is that:
- If `n` is equal to `m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes by adding one cube `m` times.
- If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `n` is greater than `m`, we need to check the parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m`. The difference `n - m` must be even because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) results in no net change. If `n - m` is even, it's possible to have `m` cubes by performing `(n - m) / 2` pairs of add-remove moves and then adding `m` cubes.

Now, let's look at the given program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line assigns the tuple (b, c) to q, but q is not used anywhere
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:  # This line checks the parity of a and b, not b and c
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

The issues in the program are:
1. The variable `q` is assigned the tuple `(b, c)` but is never used.
2. The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. It should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` to check the parity of `b` (number of moves) and `c` (number of cubes).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic described above. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
