The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted. The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be a positive integer. The state of `n`, `operations`, and `queries` does not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `t` is a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers b (1 or 2) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n for b=1, x ≥ 1 for b=2), `queries` is a list of positive integers representing the queries, `t` must be a positive integer**
