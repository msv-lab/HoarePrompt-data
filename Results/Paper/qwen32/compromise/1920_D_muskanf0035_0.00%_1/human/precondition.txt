n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple (b, x) represents an operation of type b (either 1 or 2) with an integer x, and queries is a list of integers k_i representing the queries. The length of operations is n, and the length of queries is q. Each b is either 1 or 2, and x is a positive integer such that if b=1, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, and if b=2, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
