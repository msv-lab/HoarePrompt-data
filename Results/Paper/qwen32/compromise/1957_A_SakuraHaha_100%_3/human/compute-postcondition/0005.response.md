Output State: **The output state consists of the integer `t` representing the number of test cases, the integer `n` representing the number of sticks, the list `a` of integers representing the lengths of the sticks, `ans` which remains 0, and `cnt` which is a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that stick length appears in the list `a`.**
