Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, followed by `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. The function returns whether it is possible to form a triangle with any three sticks from each test case. If it is possible, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".**
