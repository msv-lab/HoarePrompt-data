To determine what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement is executed, we need to understand the value or state of the variable `ans` based on the provided initial state.

Since the initial state does not provide any specific details about the variable `ans`, we can only describe the output in terms of `ans` itself.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of the variable `ans`)**
