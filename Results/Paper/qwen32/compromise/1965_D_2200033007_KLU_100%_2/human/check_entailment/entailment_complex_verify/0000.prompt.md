You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

        sm = 0
        
        for j in range(i, len(a)):

    #State: `a` remains a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array, and `cts` contains all cumulative sums starting from each index `i` to the end of the list `a`.
    cts.sort()
    return cts
    #The program returns `cts` which is sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `a` and returns a sorted list `cts` containing all cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of the list `a`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cts is a list of integers.
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()

    #State: - `cts`: Remains unchanged as it is the input list.
    #- `odds`: Contains the elements of `cts` with consecutive duplicates removed.
    #
    #### Example:
    #If `cts = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`, the loop will produce `odds = [1, 3, 4]` because:
    #- Start with `odds = []`
    #- Add `1` → `odds = [1]`
    #- Add `2` → `odds = [1, 2]`
    #- Skip `2` because it matches the last element of `odds` → `odds = [1]`
    #- Add `3` → `odds = [1, 3]`
    #- Skip `3` because it matches the last element of `odds` → `odds = [1]`
    #- Skip `3` because it matches the last element of `odds` → `odds = [1]`
    #- Add `4` → `odds = [1, 4]`
    #
    #However, the correct sequence should be `odds = [1, 3, 4]` as per the logic described.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #
    #Output State:
    return odds
    #The program returns `odds`, which contains the elements of `cts` with consecutive duplicates removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list with consecutive duplicate integers removed.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums in descending order, and n is an integer representing the size of the palindrome array a, where n is an odd integer and 3 <= n <= 1000.

            a[idx] = x

            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: 
    return a
    #The program returns the value of variable 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes a list of integers `odds` and an integer `n` as input. It constructs and returns a palindrome array `a` of size `n` based on the values in `odds`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList and smallList are lists of integers. bigList contains all the subarray sums of a palindrome array, and smallList contains all but one of those subarray sums. The last elements of bigList and smallList are compared and removed if they are equal until either smallList is empty or the last elements differ.

        bigList.pop()
        
        smallList.pop()
        
    #State: bigList is [1], smallList is [].
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`. It repeatedly removes the last elements of both lists if they are equal until `smallList` is empty or the last elements differ. The function then returns the last element of `bigList`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure it meets the problem description requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to recover a palindrome array `a` of size `n` from given subarray sums.
- We are given `n*(n+1)/2 - 1` subarray sums.
- The program should output a valid palindrome array `a`.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of four functions:
1. `func_1(a)`: Generates all subarray sums of array `a`.
2. `func_2(cts)`: Filters out pairs of identical subarray sums, leaving only unique sums.
3. `func_3(odds, n)`: Constructs a palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
4. `func_4(bigList, smallList)`: Finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the full list of subarray sums with the given list.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **func_1(a)**: This function generates all subarray sums correctly. It iterates through all possible subarrays and calculates their sums, storing them in a list `cts`. This part seems correct.

2. **func_2(cts)**: This function filters out pairs of identical subarray sums, which is necessary since some subarrays might have the same sum (e.g., `[1, 2, 1]` has two subarrays with sum `3`). By removing pairs, we isolate the unique sums, which should include the missing subarray sum. This part also seems correct.

3. **func_3(odds, n)**: This function constructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums. It initializes an array `a` of size `n` and fills it by calculating the differences between consecutive unique sums. The logic here assumes that the differences between consecutive sums will give us the elements of the palindrome array. This seems reasonable given the problem constraints.

4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**: This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the full list of subarray sums with the given list. It removes matching sums from both lists and returns the last remaining sum in `bigList`, which should be the missing subarray sum. This part seems correct.

### Testing the Program:
To ensure the program works correctly for all potential cases, let's consider a few scenarios:

1. **Example 1**: Given input `n=3` and subarray sums `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`, the program should output a valid palindrome array like `[1, 2, 1]`.
2. **Example 2**: Given input `n=4` and subarray sums `[18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9]`, the program should output a valid palindrome array like `[7, 2, 2, 7]`.
3. **Edge Case**: Consider a smaller array `n=3` with subarray sums `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program should output a valid palindrome array like `[1, 2, 1]`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and testing it with various scenarios, it appears to meet the problem description requirements. The program correctly generates subarray sums, filters out pairs, constructs the palindrome array, and identifies the missing subarray sum.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. It handles the generation of subarray sums, filtering of pairs, construction of the palindrome array, and identification of the missing subarray sum. The provided examples and additional testing scenarios confirm that the program works as expected.
