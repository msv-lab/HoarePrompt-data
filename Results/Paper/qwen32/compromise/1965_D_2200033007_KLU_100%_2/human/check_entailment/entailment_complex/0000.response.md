### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the code step-by-step to ensure it meets the problem requirements.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - This function calculates all possible subarray sums of the input list `a` and sorts them.
   - It correctly computes all subarray sums and sorts them, which is necessary for the subsequent steps.

2. **Function `func_2(cts)`**:
   - This function removes consecutive duplicates from the sorted list `cts`.
   - It iterates through the list and adds elements to `odds` unless the current element is the same as the last added element.
   - This function is crucial for identifying the missing subarray sum, as the missing sum will appear as a non-duplicate in the list of subarray sums.

3. **Function `func_3(odds, n)`**:
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list `odds`.
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros and fills it by calculating the differences between consecutive elements in `odds`.
   - The function ensures that the resulting array is a palindrome by setting symmetric positions to the same value.

4. **Function `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**:
   - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` and removing matching pairs.
   - It continues until `smallList` is empty or the last elements differ, returning the last element of `bigList` as the missing sum.

#### Main Program Logic:

- The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the palindrome array and the list of subarray sums.
- It sorts the subarray sums and applies `func_2` to remove consecutive duplicates.
- Depending on the length of the resulting list `odds`, it determines whether to use `n + 2` or `n - 2` to reconstruct the intermediate array `b`.
- It calculates the missing subarray sum using `func_4` and appends it to `odds`.
- Finally, it reconstructs the palindrome array `a` using `func_3` and prints it.

### Conclusion:

The provided functions and the main program logic collectively solve the problem by correctly identifying the missing subarray sum and reconstructing the palindrome array. The functions are well-defined and their roles align with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
