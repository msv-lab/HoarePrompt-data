To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze each function and see if they collectively solve the problem as described.

### Function Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
- This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a`.
- It iterates through each starting point of the subarray and calculates the sum of subarrays starting from that point.
- The sums are stored in a list `cts` which is then sorted before being returned.

#### Function 2: `func_2(cts)`
- This function processes the sorted list of subarray sums (`cts`) to find the unique subarray sums.
- It uses a list `odds` to keep track of the unique sums. If a sum appears twice consecutively, it is removed from `odds`.
- This implies that the missing subarray sum will be the one that appears an odd number of times in the original list of subarray sums.

#### Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`
- This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of unique subarray sums (`odds`).
- It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros.
- It iterates through `odds` and assigns values to `a` based on the difference between consecutive sums in `odds`, divided by 2.
- The middle element of the palindrome is handled separately.

#### Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`
- This function seems to be intended to find the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists (`bigList` and `smallList`).
- However, it only removes matching elements from the end of both lists and returns the last element of `bigList` after removals.
- This function is not directly used in the main logic provided in the code snippet, so its role is unclear.

### Main Logic
- The main logic involves generating all subarray sums, finding the unique ones, and then reconstructing the palindrome array from these unique sums.
- The assumption here is that the missing subarray sum can be identified by the unique sums, and the palindrome can be reconstructed correctly from these sums.

### Verification
- The approach seems sound in theory, as it leverages the properties of palindromes and the fact that the missing subarray sum will appear an odd number of times.
- However, the implementation of `func_4` is not utilized, and its purpose is unclear, which might indicate an incomplete or redundant part of the code.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the core functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) seem to correctly address the problem. Since the problem guarantees at least one valid solution, and the approach outlined should work for valid inputs, we can conclude that the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
