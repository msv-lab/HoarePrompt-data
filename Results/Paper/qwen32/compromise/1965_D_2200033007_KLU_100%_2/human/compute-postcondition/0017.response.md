The code snippet `prev = x` assigns the value of `x` to the variable `prev`. Given that `prev` was already `x` according to the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `prev`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the variables mentioned.

Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `n` is an integer representing the size of the palindrome array `a`, where `n` is an odd integer and 3 <= n <= 1000. `a` is a list of `n` zeros except `a[(n - 1) // 2]` which is `x`. If `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[(n - 1) // 2 - 1]` is `x`. Otherwise, `a[(n - 1) // 2 - 1]` and `a[(n - 1) // 2 + 1]` are `0`. `prev` is `x`, and `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`.**
