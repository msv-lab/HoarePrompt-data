The given code snippet assigns the value of `x` to `prev`. This means that the value of `prev` is updated to be the same as `x`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`x` is the next element in the `odds` list. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is now equal to `x`. Otherwise, `prev` holds the value of `x`, `idx` specifies the position in the list `a`, `a[idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`, and `a[n - 1 - idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`.**
