Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. The cost to move Kirill from position `i` to position `j` (where `j < i`) involves paying `a[j]` to the person at position `j` and `b[k]` for each `k` such that `j < k < i`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that attempts to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `c` is a list where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. This list represents the minimum cost to "skip" a person in the queue.
   - `suff` is a suffix sum array that stores the cumulative sum of `c` from the end to the beginning. This helps in quickly calculating the cost to skip all people from a certain position `i+1` to the end of the queue.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program then iterates over the first `k` positions (0 to `k-1`) and calculates the cost for Kirill to move to each of these positions. The cost for moving to position `i` is `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`, which is the cost to swap with the person at position `i` plus the cost to skip all people from position `i+1` to the end of the queue.
   - The minimum cost among all these calculated costs is stored in `ans` and printed as the result.

### Correctness Analysis
- The program correctly calculates the cost for Kirill to move to each of the first `k` positions by considering the minimum cost to skip people after the swap.
- The use of the suffix sum array `suff` ensures that the cost calculation is efficient, avoiding the need for nested loops that would result in a time complexity of O(n^2), which is inefficient given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue by leveraging a suffix sum array to efficiently compute the cost to skip people after a swap.
Correctness: **True**
