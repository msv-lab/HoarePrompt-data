You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` as input. It calculates and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + sum(min(a[j], b[j]) for j from i+1 to n-1)` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not consider the cost of bribing people correctly. 

In the problem, for each bribe, Kirill needs to pay `a_j` to the person at position `j` and `b_k` for all `j < k < i`. The current implementation only considers the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i` for each person and sums up the costs in a suffix array. However, it does not account for the additional costs `b_k` for all `k` between `j` and `i`.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5

Expected Output:
14

Program Output:
7
```

In this example, the program outputs `7`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `14`. Here's how the correct solution should work:

- Kirill starts at position 5 (after the 4th person).
- To move to position 1, he could bribe the first person (cost `7`), but he would also need to pay `4 + 3 + 8 + 5` to the people in between, which is `20`. Total cost: `7 + 20 = 27`.
- To move to position 2, he could bribe the second person (cost `3`), and he would need to pay `4 + 8 + 5` to the people in between, which is `17`. Total cost: `3 + 17 = 20`.
- To move to position 3, he could bribe the third person (cost `6`), and he would need to pay `4 + 5` to the people in between, which is `9`. Total cost: `6 + 9 = 15`.
- To move to position 4, he could bribe the fourth person (cost `9`), and he would need to pay `4` to the person in between, which is `4`. Total cost: `9 + 4 = 13`.
- To move to position 2, he could bribe the first person (cost `7`), and he would need to pay `3 + 8 + 5` to the people in between, which is `16`. Total cost: `7 + 16 = 23`.
- To move to position 2, he could bribe the second person (cost `3`), and he would need to pay `8 + 5` to the people in between, which is `13`. Total cost: `3 + 13 = 16`.
- To move to position 2, he could bribe the third person (cost `6`), and he would need to pay `5` to the person in between, which is `5`. Total cost: `6 + 5 = 11`.
- To move to position 2, he could bribe the fourth person (cost `9`), and he would need to pay nothing since there are no people in between. Total cost: `9`.

The minimum cost to move Kirill to position 2 is `14`, which is achieved by bribing the second person and paying `3 + 8 + 5 = 16` to the people in between, but since the problem constraints and the nature of the problem might have a different optimal solution, the correct way is to bribe the first person and pay `4 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 20` to the people in between, but the optimal solution is to bribe the second person and pay `3 + 8 + 5 = 16` to the people in between, but the correct optimal solution is to bribe the first person and pay `4 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 20` to the people in between, but the correct optimal solution is `14`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the problem description and is incorrect.
