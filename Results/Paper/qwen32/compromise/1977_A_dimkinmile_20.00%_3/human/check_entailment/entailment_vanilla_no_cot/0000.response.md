Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The condition `if n >= m` is not sufficient to determine if `m` cubes can be achieved after `n` moves. 

To be correct, the program should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even because each move either adds or removes one cube, and to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even (since each pair of moves can either add two cubes, remove two cubes, or add one and remove one, which results in a net change of zero or an even number).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This program checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and if `n` is at least `m` (since you can't have more cubes than moves). If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
