Reasoning: The original assessment is incorrect. The program's logic is actually correct for determining whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Let's break down the logic:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move.
- The program checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes).
- If `n >= m`, it is always possible for Nikita to end up with `m` cubes because he can simply add `m` cubes in `m` moves and then, if necessary, remove cubes in the remaining `n - m` moves to maintain `m` cubes.
- If `n < m`, it is impossible for Nikita to end up with `m` cubes because he cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has.

The example provided in the original assessment (n = 5, m = 3) demonstrates a valid sequence where Nikita ends up with 3 cubes after 5 moves. However, the program correctly outputs "Yes" for this case because `n` (5) is indeed greater than or equal to `m` (3).

The original assessment's critique is based on a misunderstanding of the problem constraints and the program's logic. The program correctly handles all valid cases.

Final: **True**
