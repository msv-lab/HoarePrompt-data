You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: `n` and `m` are integers where `n` represents the number of moves and `m` represents the desired number of cubes in the tower. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Otherwise, `n` is less than `m`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and outputs "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". However, this logic is incorrect because Nikita can also remove cubes from the tower, which means the number of cubes can fluctuate up and down.

For example, consider the test case `n = 5` and `m = 3`:
- Nikita can start with 0 cubes.
- In the first move, he can add 1 cube (total: 1).
- In the second move, he can add 1 cube (total: 2).
- In the third move, he can add 1 cube (total: 3).
- In the fourth move, he can remove 1 cube (total: 2).
- In the fifth move, he can add 1 cube (total: 3).

Thus, it is possible to end up with 3 cubes after 5 moves, but the program would output "No" for this case because `n` (5) is greater than `m` (3) but the logic does not account for the possibility of removing cubes.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for cases where `n` is greater than `m`, but the sequence of adding and removing cubes can result in exactly `m` cubes.
