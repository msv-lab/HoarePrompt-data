### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of screens required to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on a 5x3 grid.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers, `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Space Requirements:**
   - The space required for 1x1 icons is simply `x`.
   - The space required for 2x2 icons is `y * 4` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

3. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since a 5x3 grid has 15 cells, the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit perfectly on a screen is 3 (because 3 * 4 = 12, and the remaining 3 cells can be used for 1x1 icons).
   - If `y` is even, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons are `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons, no additional screens are needed.
   - If not, the remaining 1x1 icons are placed on additional screens. The number of additional screens required is calculated based on the remaining 1x1 icons and the capacity of a screen (15 cells).

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- The program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
- It then calculates the remaining capacity of those screens and checks if itâ€™s enough to place the 1x1 icons.
- If not, it calculates how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
- The logic for handling the placement of icons and calculating the required number of screens is correct according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the required logic and handles all edge cases as per the problem description and the provided examples.

**Correctness: True**
