To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given code and the initial state.

The loop processes each test case independently. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The result is derived from the following logic:

1. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the result is `n * a`.
2. If `a` is less than `b`, the result is calculated in two parts:
   - The first part (`ans`) is the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decrementing by 1, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - The second part (`p2`) is `(n - k) * a`, which is the product of the remaining terms (if any) and `a`.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` changes with each iteration, the final output state will be a series of printed results, one for each test case.

Given that the initial state only specifies the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, the output state will be the sequence of results printed by the loop, one per line.

Output State: **A series of integers, each representing the result of a test case, printed on a new line.**
