After analyzing the problem description, the provided program code, and the annotated version, let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the program.

### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment

1. **Function `func_2` does not pass `a` and `ops` to `recursive_maximize_sum` correctly:**
   - The original assessment is correct. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not receiving `a` and `ops` as parameters, which results in a `NameError` because `a` and `ops` are not defined within the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined correctly:**
   - The original assessment is also correct. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` should receive `a` and `ops` as parameters to ensure that it can modify the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` correctly.

3. **Function `func_1` has incorrect logic:**
   - The original assessment is correct. The logic in `func_1` for setting the values in the range `[l, r]` to the MEX of the range and the recursive calls does not align with the goal of maximizing the sum.

### Additional Analysis Using Annotations

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The annotations show that `func_1` is supposed to set the values in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1` if they are not already equal to this value. However, the logic for setting `a[l] = 0` when `l == r` and `a[l] != 0` is incorrect because it does not align with the goal of maximizing the sum.

- **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
  - The annotations show that the function is supposed to recursively split the array and apply `func_1` when the sum of the elements in the range `[l, r]` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. However, the function is not defined to accept `a` and `ops` as parameters, which is a critical issue.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The annotations show that `func_2` initializes `ops` as an empty list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without passing `a` and `ops`. This will result in a `NameError`.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the original assessment and confirmed by the annotations, the program is indeed incorrect. The critical errors in parameter passing and logic prevent the program from correctly solving the problem.

**Final: False**
