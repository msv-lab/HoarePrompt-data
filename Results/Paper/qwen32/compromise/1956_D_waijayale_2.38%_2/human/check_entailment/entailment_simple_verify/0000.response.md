Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the code, and the annotations.

### Analysis of the Problem Description and Code

1. **Function `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - The function `func_2` initializes `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`. However, `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined to take `a` and `ops` as parameters.
   - This leads to a `NameError` because `a` and `ops` are not defined within the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is supposed to maximize the sum of the array `a` within the range `[l, r]`. However, it does not pass `a` and `ops` as parameters, leading to the `NameError`.
   - The logic for determining when to apply `func_1` and when to recursively split the array seems flawed.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to set the values in the range `[l, r]` to the MEX of the range. However, the logic for setting the values and the recursive calls seems incorrect.
   - Setting `a[l] = 0` when `l == r` and `a[l] != 0` does not align with the goal of maximizing the sum.
   - The recursive calls and the logic for setting the values to `r - l + 1` are not correctly implemented to achieve the desired result.

### Annotations Analysis

The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not address the crucial issue of the `NameError` due to the incorrect parameter passing. The annotations also do not address the flawed logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`.

### Correctness Evaluation

Given the issues identified:

1. **Parameter Passing Issue**:
   - `recursive_maximize_sum` should be defined to take `a` and `ops` as parameters.
   - The call to `recursive_maximize_sum` in `func_2` should pass `a` and `ops`.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` needs to be corrected to ensure that the MEX operation is correctly applied to maximize the sum.
   - The current logic does not ensure that the MEX is calculated and applied correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the identified issues, the program is incorrect. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the problems with parameter passing and the flawed logic.

**Final:** **False**
