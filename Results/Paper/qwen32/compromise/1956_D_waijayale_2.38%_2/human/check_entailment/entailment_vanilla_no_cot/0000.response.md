Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from solving the problem correctly:

1. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`, but `ops` is not defined in this function scope. It seems to be expecting `ops` to be defined in the global scope or passed as an argument, which it is not.

2. **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**: This function is supposed to modify the array `a` and update the operations list `ops`. However, `a` and `ops` are not passed as arguments to the function. Instead, they seem to be assumed to be global variables, which is not a good practice and can lead to errors if the function is used in a different context.

3. **Logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: The logic for determining when to perform an operation and how to split the array is not correct. The function checks if the sum of the current subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, which does not directly relate to the MEX operation. The MEX operation should be used to determine the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the subarray, and then the subarray should be set to that value.

4. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is supposed to perform operations to set the subarray to the MEX value, but it does not correctly calculate the MEX value. It also modifies the array and the operations list, but these are not passed as arguments, leading to potential errors.

5. **Function 4 (`func_3`)**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results. However, since `func_2` does not work correctly, the output will also be incorrect.

To fix the program, the functions need to be properly defined to take the array and operations list as arguments, and the MEX value should be correctly calculated and used to update the array. The logic for determining when to perform operations and how to split the array should also be corrected to align with the problem description.
