The given code snippet is a function call to `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)`. This function call does not directly modify the variables `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` in the provided initial state. Instead, it likely performs some operations within the function that are not detailed in the snippet.

Since the function call does not directly affect the variables listed in the initial state and does not return any value that is captured or used in the provided code snippet, the values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, and `pos` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n, where n is the length of the array `a`. `s` is the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive. The sum `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `mx` is the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. Additionally, if `pos` is not equal to `l`, then `pos` is not equal to `l`. The current value of `pos` is not equal to `r`.**
