To determine the output state, we need to understand what the function `func_2` does with the input list `a`. Since the definition of `func_2` is not provided, we can only infer that `func_2` returns three values which are assigned to `s`, `m`, and `ops`.

Given that the initial state specifies `a` as a list of integers and `n` as an integer value, and the code snippet calls `func_2(a)` and assigns its return values to `s`, `m`, and `ops`, we can infer the following:

- `a` remains unchanged as it is only passed to the function and not modified by the code snippet.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not used in the code snippet.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are assigned the return values of `func_2(a)`.

Since the specific behavior of `func_2` is not provided, we can only describe the output state in terms of the variables that have been changed and their new values.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is the integer value provided as input, `s` is the first return value of `func_2(a)`, `m` is the second return value of `func_2(a)`, `ops` is the third return value of `func_2(a)`**.
