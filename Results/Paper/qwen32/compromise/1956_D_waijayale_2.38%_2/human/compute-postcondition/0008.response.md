The code snippet finds the index of the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]` and adds `l` to it to get the position in the original array `a`. This value is then assigned to the variable `pos`.

Given the initial state, the values of `l`, `r`, `s`, and `mx` remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of the variable `pos`, which is calculated as `a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n, where n is the length of the array `a`. `s` is the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive. The sum `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `mx` is the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`.**
