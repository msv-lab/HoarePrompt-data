The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and the list at index `b` contains `a`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input; `L` is the final integer value that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the last calculated midpoint; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is 2**
