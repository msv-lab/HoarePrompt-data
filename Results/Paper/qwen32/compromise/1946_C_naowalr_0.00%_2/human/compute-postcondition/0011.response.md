The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Given the initial state, `adj[b]` originally contains `[a, a]`. After appending `a`, `adj[b]` will now contain `[a, a, a]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a, a, a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the new integers read from input; `i` is 1.**
