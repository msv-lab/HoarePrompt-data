The code appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contains `[b, b]`. After appending `b`, `adj[a]` will contain `[b, b, b]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b, b, b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a, a, a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from input; `i` is 2**.
