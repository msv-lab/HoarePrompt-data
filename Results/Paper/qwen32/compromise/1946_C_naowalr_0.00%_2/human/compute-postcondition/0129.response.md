Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` as per the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is `(L + R) // 2`; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is -1; `numCuts` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `R` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
