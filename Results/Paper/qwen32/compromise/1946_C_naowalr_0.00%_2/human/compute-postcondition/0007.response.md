The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Given the initial state, `adj[b]` originally contains `[a]`. After appending `a` again, `adj[b]` will contain `[a, a]`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a, a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is the first integer read from input; `b` is the second integer read from input.**
