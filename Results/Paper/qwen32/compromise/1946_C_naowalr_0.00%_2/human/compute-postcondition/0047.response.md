The given code snippet initializes `adj` as a list of empty lists, with the length of the list being `n + 1`. This means that `adj` will now be a list containing `n + 1` empty lists, indexed from 0 to `n`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes its value due to this code snippet is `adj`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is the first integer read from input; `b` is the second integer read from input; `L` is the final integer value that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the last calculated midpoint; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `z` is incremented by 1.**
