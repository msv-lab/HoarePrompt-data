The only variable in the loop head is `z`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `z` and `t`. If `z` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` would have taken on the value of the loop counter, which means it was incremented from its previous value. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `z` should be incremented by 1.

Given that `t` is an integer greater than 0, and assuming that `z` has just completed an iteration where it was some value less than `t`, we simply need to increment `z` by 1.

State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is the first integer read from input; `b` is the second integer read from input; `L` is the final integer value that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the last calculated midpoint; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `z` is incremented by 1**
