Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` as per the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is 100001; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is -1; `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, or `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
