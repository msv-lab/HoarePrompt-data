Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The program simply prints points in the first row of the grid, which will not generate a variety of Manhattan distances.

For example, if \( n = 3 \), the program will output:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
This results in the set of Manhattan distances:
\[
\{|1-1|+|1-1|, |1-1|+|2-2|, |1-1|+|3-3|, |1-1|+|1-2|, |1-1|+|1-3|, |1-2|+|2-3|\} = \{0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1\} = \{0, 1, 2\}
\]
The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3, but there exists an arrangement that can achieve a size of 4, as shown in the problem description.

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), a better strategy is to distribute the points in a way that covers a wider range of Manhattan distances. For example, placing points at (1,1), (1,3), and (3,1) for \( n = 3 \) would result in the set:
\[
\{|1-1|+|1-1|, |1-1|+|3-3|, |3-3|+|1-1|, |1-1|+|1-3|, |1-3|+|1-1|, |1-3|+|3-1|\} = \{0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4\} = \{0, 2, 4\}
\]
However, a better arrangement would be (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1) as mentioned in the problem description, which results in:
\[
\{|2-2|+|1-1|, |2-2|+|3-3|, |3-3|+|1-1|, |2-2|+|1-3|, |2-3|+|1-1|, |2-3|+|3-1|\} = \{0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3\} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
\]
Thus, the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4, which is optimal for \( n = 3 \).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all possible values of \( n \).
