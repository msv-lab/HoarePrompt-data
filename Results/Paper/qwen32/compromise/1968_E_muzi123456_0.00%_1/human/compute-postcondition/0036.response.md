Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This statement suggests that `t` is being decremented by 1, but it does not provide the initial value of `t`.
- `n` must be at least 1: This provides a constraint on `n`, but it does not provide its exact value.
- `i` is 1: This sets the value of `i` to 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is instructed to print the string `'1'` followed by a space, which is specified by the `end=' '` argument. This means that after printing `'1'`, the cursor will move to the next position (a space to the right) rather than moving to the next line.
- The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

### Output:
The output will be the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
