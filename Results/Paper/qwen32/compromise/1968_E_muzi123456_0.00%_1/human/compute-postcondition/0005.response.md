The provided initial state describes the variables `t` and `n`, but the print statement does not use these variables. Instead, it prints the string `'1'` followed by a space, and it does not add a newline after the output due to the `end=' '` argument.

Let's break it down:
- The `print` function is called with the string `'1'` and the `end` parameter set to a space `' '`.
- This means that after printing `'1'`, the cursor will remain on the same line, followed by a space, and will not move to the next line.

Given this information, the output will be:
Output: **1 ** (where the output is the number 1 followed by a space)
