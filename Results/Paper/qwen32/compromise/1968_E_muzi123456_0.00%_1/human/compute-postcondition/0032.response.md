To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if the range `(1, n + 1)` is valid, meaning `n` must be at least 1 (since the range starts at 1 and goes up to `n + 1`).

Let's analyze the provided state before the loop starts:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This state is not relevant to the loop's execution condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- `n` is an input integer: This is relevant because it determines the range of the loop.
- `i` is `n + 1`: This state is also not relevant to the loop's execution condition because `i` is reassigned at the start of each iteration of the loop.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1. The value of `i` before the loop starts does not affect the loop's execution because it is immediately reassigned by the `range` function.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n + 1`**
