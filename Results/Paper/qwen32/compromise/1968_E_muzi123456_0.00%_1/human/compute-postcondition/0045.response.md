Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 50. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, and prints `n` lines, each containing the number `1` followed by the integers from `1` to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.**
