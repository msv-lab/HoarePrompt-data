In this task, the `while` loop will execute as long as the condition `t` is truthy. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy. Given that `t` is an integer input by the user such that `1 <= t <= 50`, `t` will always be a truthy value, meaning the loop will always execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to the state for the loop to execute the first time. The state right before the loop is already sufficient to ensure that the loop will run.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3 for each of the `t` test cases.**
