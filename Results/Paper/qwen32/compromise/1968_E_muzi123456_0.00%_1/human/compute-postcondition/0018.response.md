To ensure the `for` loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1` (not inclusive), so `n` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop runs even once. Additionally, the initial value of `i` before the loop starts should not interfere with the loop's range, as `i` is re-initialized at the start of each iteration.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`.
- `n` is the integer value of the input.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

Let's analyze and adjust the necessary states:
- `n` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop runs.
- `i` is re-initialized in the loop head, so its value before the loop starts (`n + 1`) does not affect the loop's execution. However, to match the loop's expected initial condition, we should set `i` to a value that doesn't conflict with the loop's range, such as its initial value before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n + 1`**

This state ensures that the loop can execute as intended, given that `n` is at least 1, and `i` is set to a value that does not interfere with the loop's range.
