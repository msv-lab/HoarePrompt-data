To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does for each test case. The loop reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case and prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the following conditions:

1. If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it prints 'NO'.
2. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. After all iterations, the only variables that will have changed are those involved in the loop and the output (which is printed). The variable `itest` will have the value `t` after the loop completes, as it increments from `0` to `t-1`.

The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the values from the last test case processed by the loop. However, since we are asked for the output state and not the variable states, we focus on the printed output.

Given that the output is printed for each test case, the final output state will be the concatenation of all 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each test case. Since we do not have specific values for `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, we cannot determine the exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO'. However, we can describe the state in a general form.

Output State: **A series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each test case based on the provided conditions.**
