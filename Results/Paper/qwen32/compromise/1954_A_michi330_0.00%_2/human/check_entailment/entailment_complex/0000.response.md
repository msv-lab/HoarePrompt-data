### Reasoning:
To determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, we need to analyze the conditions given.

1. **Single Part (n = 1)**: If there is only one part, Bob can trivially repaint it to any color, so the answer is always "NO".

2. **Single Color (m = 1)**: If there is only one color available, Alice has no choice but to paint all parts the same color, so Bob can trivially make all parts the same color, and the answer is "NO".

3. **General Case (n > 1, m > 1)**: Here, Alice can use multiple colors to paint the ribbon. The key is to ensure that no matter how Bob repaints up to `k` parts, there will still be at least two parts with different colors.

   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is "NO".
   
   - If `n - ceil(n / m) >= k`, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that the most frequent color appears fewer than `n - k` times. This ensures that even if Bob repaints up to `k` parts, there will still be parts of different colors. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 2`, Alice can paint the ribbon as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]. Here, the most frequent color (1) appears 3 times, and `n - ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2`. Since `k >= 2`, Bob cannot make all parts the same color. Thus, the answer is "YES".
   
   - If `n - ceil(n / m) < k`, Alice cannot ensure that Bob cannot repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is "NO".

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` and prints "NO" in those cases. Otherwise, it prints "YES".
