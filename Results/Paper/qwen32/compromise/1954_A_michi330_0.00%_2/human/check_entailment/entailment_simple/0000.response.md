### Reasoning:

To determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, we need to analyze the given conditions:

1. **Single Part Case (n = 1):** If the ribbon consists of only one part, Bob can trivially repaint it no matter the color, so Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. Therefore, the output should be "NO".

2. **Single Color Case (m = 1):** If there is only one color available, Alice has no choice but to paint all parts the same color, so Bob can trivially repaint the ribbon to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the output should be "NO".

3. **General Case:** For the general case, we need to check if Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts the same color. 

   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so the output should be "NO".
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that no single color dominates such that repainting `k` parts cannot make all parts the same color. This is because `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the minimum number of parts that must be the most frequent color if the ribbon is painted as evenly as possible. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, it means that even if Bob repainted `k` parts, there would still be parts of a different color that prevent all parts from being the same color. Therefore, the output should be "YES".

### Conclusion:

The provided program checks the conditions correctly:
- If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

This logic aligns with the reasoning above and correctly handles all the given test cases.
