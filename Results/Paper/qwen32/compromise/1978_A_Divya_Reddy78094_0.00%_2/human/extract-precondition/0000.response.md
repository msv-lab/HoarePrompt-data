Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of books. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book. The number of test cases t is given at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**
