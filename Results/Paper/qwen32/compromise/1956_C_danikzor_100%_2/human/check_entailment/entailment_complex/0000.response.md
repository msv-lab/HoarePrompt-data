### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix by performing a series of operations. The operations involve permuting either a row or a column of the matrix. The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum and do so using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

The provided program seems to follow a strategy where it fills the matrix in such a way that it maximizes the sum. Let's analyze the operations performed by the program:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix using the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \). This formula represents the sum of the first \( n \) squares multiplied by 2, which is indeed the maximum sum achievable for such a matrix with the given operations.

2. **Operations:**
   For each test case with size \( n \), the program performs \( 2n \) operations. Specifically, for each row and column from 1 to \( n \), it performs two operations:
   - Type 1 operation on row \( i \) with permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \).
   - Type 2 operation on column \( i \) with the same permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \).

Let's verify if these operations indeed maximize the sum:

- **Type 1 Operation:** Assigns the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \) to row \( i \).
- **Type 2 Operation:** Assigns the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \) to column \( i \).

By assigning the largest possible values to each row and column, the program ensures that each cell in the matrix is filled with the maximum possible value it can take under the constraints of the operations. Specifically, the largest value \( n \) is placed in each row and column, and the next largest values are placed in the remaining positions, ensuring that the sum of the matrix is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the operations in a way that maximizes the sum of the matrix while using no more than \( 2n \) operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
