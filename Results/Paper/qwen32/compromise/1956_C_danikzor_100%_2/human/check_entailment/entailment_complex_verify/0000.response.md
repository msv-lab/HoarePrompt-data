### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program's logic for achieving the maximum sum in the matrix. Let's break down the issues and verify the program's correctness step-by-step.

#### Key Points:
1. **Formula for Maximum Sum**:
   - The formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \) correctly computes the maximum sum achievable for an \( n \times n \) matrix using the allowed operations.
   
2. **Operations**:
   - The operations performed by the program are:
     - Type 1 operation on row \( i \) with permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \)
     - Type 2 operation on column \( i \) with permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \)
   - This approach does not guarantee the maximum sum because it places the highest numbers (from \( n \) to \( 1 \)) in a way that does not necessarily fill the matrix optimally.

#### Counterexample:
For \( n = 2 \):
- The program's operations:
  - Type 1 operation on row 1 with permutation [2, 1]
  - Type 1 operation on row 2 with permutation [2, 1]
  - Type 2 operation on column 1 with permutation [2, 1]
  - Type 2 operation on column 2 with permutation [2, 1]
- Resulting matrix:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 \\
  2 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- Sum: \( 6 \)

- Optimal matrix:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  3 & 2 \\
  2 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- Sum: \( 7 \)

#### Correct Approach:
To achieve the maximum sum, a more strategic placement of numbers is needed. One such strategy is to fill the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum while adhering to the operations' constraints. For example, filling the matrix diagonally or in a specific pattern can yield the optimal result.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the operations to achieve the maximum sum for all cases, as demonstrated by the counterexample. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
