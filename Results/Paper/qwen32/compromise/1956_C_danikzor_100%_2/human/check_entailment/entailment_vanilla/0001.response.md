### Reasoning:

The given problem involves maximizing the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with zeroes by performing at most \( 2n \) operations. The two types of operations are:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Choose a row \( i \) and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. **Type 2 Operation**: Choose a column \( i \) and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix. 

### Analysis of the Program:

The program provided reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the value of \( n \).
2. Prints the maximum possible sum and the number of operations (which is \( 2n \)).
3. For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs:
   - A Type 1 operation to fill row \( i \) with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \).
   - A Type 2 operation to fill column \( i \) with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \).

Let's analyze whether this approach is correct and achieves the maximum sum:

#### Maximum Sum Calculation:
The maximum possible sum can be calculated by filling the matrix in such a way that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly \( n \) times in the matrix. This can be done by filling each row with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \) and each column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

The sum of the numbers from 1 to \( n \) is given by the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

Since each number from 1 to \( n \) appears \( n \) times in the matrix, the total sum of the matrix is:
\[ \text{Total Sum} = n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \]

However, the program calculates the maximum sum as:
\[ \text{Max Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \]

This formula does not match the expected maximum sum for the matrix. The correct formula should be:
\[ \text{Max Sum} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \]

#### Operations:
The program performs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit. However, the operations themselves do not achieve the maximum sum as described above.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
