To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the context and the calculations involved in the print statement.

### Initial State:
- The input consists of multiple test cases.
- The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), which represents the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), representing the size of an `n x n` matrix.
- The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
- `n` is read from the input for each test case.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Part of the Print Statement:**
   - `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`
   - This formula calculates the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - The formula for the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers is given by:
     \[
     \text{Sum of squares} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}
     \]
   - However, in the given code, the formula used is slightly different: `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
   - This formula does not represent the sum of squares directly but rather a different calculation.

2. **Second Part of the Print Statement:**
   - `2 * n`
   - This simply doubles the value of `n`.

### Output:
For each test case, the code will print two values:
1. The result of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
2. The result of the expression `2 * n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the size of the n x n matrix for each test case)**
