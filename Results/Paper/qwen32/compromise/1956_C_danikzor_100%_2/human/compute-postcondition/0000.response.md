The provided code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, `n` was not defined before, and the input is expected to be the size of an n x n matrix for each test case. After executing the code, `n` will hold the integer value read from the input.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n x n matrix. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5. `n` is the integer read from the input.**
