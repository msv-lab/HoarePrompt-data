To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze the provided loop code:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
    print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n` (inclusive).
2. **First Print Statement**: For each iteration, it prints `1`, the current value of `i`, and then a sequence of numbers from `n` down to `1`.
3. **Second Print Statement**: Immediately after, it prints `2`, the current value of `i`, and then the same sequence of numbers from `n` down to `1`.

### Output for Each Test Case:
For each test case with a given `n`, the loop will produce `2 * n` lines of output. Each pair of lines will be:
- The first line: `1`, `i`, `n`, `n-1`, ..., `2`, `1`
- The second line: `2`, `i`, `n`, `n-1`, ..., `2`, `1`

### Example:
If `n = 3`, the output will be:
```
1 1 3 2 1
2 1 3 2 1
1 2 3 2 1
2 2 3 2 1
1 3 3 2 1
2 3 3 2 1
```

### General Output State:
For any given `n`, the output will consist of `2 * n` lines, with each pair of lines corresponding to the current iteration `i` of the loop. Each pair will follow the pattern described above.

### Final Output State Format:
The output state will be a series of printed lines as described above for each test case. Since the problem asks for a description in the format requested, we note that the state of variables other than those in the loop (i.e., `i` and the sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **For each test case with integer `n`, the output consists of `2 * n` lines. Each pair of lines for `i` from 1 to `n` is `1 i n n-1 ... 2 1` followed by `2 i n n-1 ... 2 1`.**
