Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero; `l` is not equal to `r`; `k` is positive; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each reduced by `mi`. If either `a[l]` or `a[r]` becomes 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `l` or `r` is adjusted accordingly. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, `ans` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
