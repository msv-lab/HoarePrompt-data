The `while` loop in the provided code will execute as long as `T` is a truthy value. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `T` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state where `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), `T` already satisfies the condition to execute the loop at least once because it is guaranteed to be within a range that includes only positive integers.

Thus, no adjustment to `T` is necessary, and the state right before the loop can be repeated as is.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
