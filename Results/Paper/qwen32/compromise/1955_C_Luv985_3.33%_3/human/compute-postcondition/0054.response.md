Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, and each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero; `l` is not equal to `r`; `k` is positive; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the operation; `k` is now `k - 2 * mi`; `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been increased by 1. The values of `T`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and the condition that `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero, and `l` is not equal to `r`, remain unchanged. The value of `k` has been reduced by `2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the operation.
