The code snippet converts the string `k` to an integer. Therefore, the string `k` representing an integer will now be an actual integer value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
