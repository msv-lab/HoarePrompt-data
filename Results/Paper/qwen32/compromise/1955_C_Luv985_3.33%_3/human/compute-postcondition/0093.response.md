Postcondition: **`l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is `n - 2` if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `ans` is 2 if `a[l]` was 0 and `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `a[l]` was 0 and `a[r]` is not 0, or `ans` is 1 if `a[l]` was not 0 and `a[r]` is 0, or `ans` is 0 if `a[l]` was not 0 and `a[r]` is not 0, `T` is False, `n` is the first input value (as an integer), `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, if `a[r]` is 0, `a[r]` is explicitly 0.**
