Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `T` is 0, `a` is the list with updated integer values from the input, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`; `t` is `k % 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be the remainder of `k` divided by 2. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
