Output State: **`l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is `n - 2` if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is set to 3 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are 0, 2 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` is 0, and 1 if neither `a[l]` nor `a[r]` is 0, `T` remains False, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `ans` was initially 2, it becomes 3; if `ans` was initially 1, it becomes 2; and if `ans` was initially 0, it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
