Postcondition: **`l` is 1 and `r` is at least 1, or `l` is 0 and `r` is at least 0, and `k` is greater than 0. `a[l]` has been reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` has been reduced by `mi`, and `k` has been reduced by `mi * 2`. If `a[r]` was 0, `ans` has been incremented by 1. If `a[l]` was initially 0, `l` has been incremented by 1 and `ans` has been incremented by 1.**
