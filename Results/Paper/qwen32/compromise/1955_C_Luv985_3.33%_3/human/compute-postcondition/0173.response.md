The value of `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`. The values of `n`, `l`, `r`, `a`, and `mi` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `a` is the list with updated integer values where `a[0]` is decreased by `mi` and `a[n-1]` is further decreased by `mi`, `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of the updated `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `a` is the list with updated integer values where `a[0]` is decreased by `mi` and `a[n-1]` is further decreased by `mi`, `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of the updated `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.**
