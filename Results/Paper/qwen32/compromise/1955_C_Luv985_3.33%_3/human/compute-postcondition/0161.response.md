Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `ans` is 2 if `a[0]` is 0 and `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 1. `T` is 0, `a` is the list with updated integer values where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `mi` is `min(a[0] - mi, a[n - 1] - mi)`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. If `a[0]` is 0, `l` is 1, otherwise `l` remains 0. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2`, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts.
