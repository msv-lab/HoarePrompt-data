Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is updated based on the condition, `l` and `r` are updated based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a` is the list with updated integer values, and `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of the updated `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `ans` is set to 2 if both `a[0]` and `a[r]` are 0, otherwise `ans` is set to 1, and `mi` is recalculated. If `a[0]` is 0, `l` is set to 1, otherwise `l` remains 0. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2`, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1`. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` is set to 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, otherwise `ans` is set to 0.**
