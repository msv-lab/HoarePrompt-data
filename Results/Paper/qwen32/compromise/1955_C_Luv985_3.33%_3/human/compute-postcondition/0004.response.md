Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is a string representing an integer where 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is a string representing an integer where 1 ≤ int(k) ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The code reads two values from the input, splits them, and assigns the first value to `n` and the second value to `k`. Both `n` and `k` are read as strings, and their actual integer values should be within the specified ranges. The variable `T` and the list `a` remain unchanged.
