The code snippet `k -= mi * 2` reduces the value of `k` by twice the value of `mi`. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Given that `mi` is the minimum of the original `a[l]` and `a[r]`, the new value of `k` will be its original value minus `2 * mi`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 minus 2 * `mi`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`; `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero; `l` is not equal to `r`; `k` is positive; `mi` is the minimum of the original `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**
