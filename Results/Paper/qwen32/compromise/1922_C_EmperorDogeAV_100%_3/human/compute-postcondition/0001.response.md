To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head variables `i` and `n - 1`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 2.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `cities` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains:
  - an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities.
  - a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_n` ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order.
- `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros.

The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 2. The initial value of `i` should be 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure `n` is at least 2.
- `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros; `i` is 0.**
