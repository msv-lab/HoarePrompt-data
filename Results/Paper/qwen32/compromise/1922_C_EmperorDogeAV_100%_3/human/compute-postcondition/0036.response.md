Output State: **The program returns `prog_cities`, which is a list of `n - 1` integers. Each `i`-th element in `prog_cities` is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`. Otherwise, the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`.**
