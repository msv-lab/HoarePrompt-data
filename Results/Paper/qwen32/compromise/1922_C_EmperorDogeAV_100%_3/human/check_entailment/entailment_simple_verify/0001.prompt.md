You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. Additionally, there are m queries (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), each represented as a tuple of two integers (x_i, y_i) (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) indicating the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is uniquely determined.

Otherwise, the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's examine the program step by step to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It also reads the queries themselves.

2. **Finding Closest Cities:**
   - The function `func_1` is called twice:
     - Once with the list of cities in their original order to determine the closest city for each city when moving forward.
     - Once with the list of cities in reverse order to determine the closest city for each city when moving backward.
   - Inside `func_1`, for each city, it determines the closest city by comparing the distance to the next city and the previous city.
   - If the next city is closer, it sets the value to `1` (indicating a move to the closest city costs 1 coin). Otherwise, it sets the value to the distance to the next city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward closest city costs.
   - This allows for efficient calculation of the total cost to move from one city to another using the closest city strategy.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, it calculates the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`:
     - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sums.
     - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sums.
   - The cost is calculated as the difference in prefix sums between the two cities.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Closest City Costs:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the closest city costs. It sets the cost to `1` only when the next city is closer, but it should set the cost to `1` for moving to the closest city regardless of whether it's the next or previous city.
   - The cost should be `1` if the closest city is the next city or the previous city, and the distance otherwise.

2. **Off-by-One Errors:**
   - The prefix sums are calculated incorrectly. The prefix sums should be calculated based on the correct closest city costs, not the incorrect values computed by `func_1`.

3. **Reverse Logic for Backward Costs:**
   - The backward costs are calculated by reversing the list of cities and then reversing the prefix sums, which is incorrect. The backward costs should be calculated directly from the reversed list of cities without reversing the prefix sums again.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified in the handling of closest city costs and prefix sums, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities.

**Correctness: False**
