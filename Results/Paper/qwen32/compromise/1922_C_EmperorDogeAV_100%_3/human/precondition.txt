cities is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and is structured as follows: the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, the third element is an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries, and the remaining elements are m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city in a test case, there is a uniquely determined closest city.
