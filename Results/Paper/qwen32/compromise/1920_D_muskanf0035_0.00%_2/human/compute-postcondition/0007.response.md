Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of operations), `operations` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `b` (either 1 or 2) and an integer `x` (with constraints based on the value of `b`)), and `queries` (a list of positive integers representing the queries). The function processes the operations and queries to produce and return a list of results. Based on the provided example, the function returns `[3, 3, 5]`.**
