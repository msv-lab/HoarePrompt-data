To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function `func_1`. Since the function `func_1` is not provided, we will infer its role based on the typical behavior of such problems. Generally, `func_1` processes the `operations` and `queries` to produce some result.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
    print(*result)
```
The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration:
1. It reads `n` and `q` from the input.
2. It reads `n` operations.
3. It reads `q` queries.
4. It calls `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments.
5. It prints the result of `func_1`.

Since `t` is the number of iterations, after all iterations, the state of the variables `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` will be the values from the last iteration. The state of `t` will remain unchanged as it is the loop counter.

Let's assume that the last iteration of the loop reads the following values:
- `n` is the number of operations for the last iteration.
- `q` is the number of queries for the last iteration.
- `operations` is the list of operations for the last iteration.
- `queries` is the list of queries for the last iteration.
- `result` is the output of `func_1` for the last iteration.

The output state after all iterations will be the state of these variables from the last iteration.

Output State: **`n` is the number of operations for the last iteration, `q` is the number of queries for the last iteration, `operations` is the list of operations for the last iteration, `queries` is the list of queries for the last iteration, and `result` is the output of `func_1` for the last iteration.**
