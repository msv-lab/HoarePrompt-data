Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `operations`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x` (with `b` being either 1 or 2, and `x` being a positive integer), and `queries`, which is a list of positive integers representing the queries. The function processes the operations and then returns a list of results corresponding to each query.**
