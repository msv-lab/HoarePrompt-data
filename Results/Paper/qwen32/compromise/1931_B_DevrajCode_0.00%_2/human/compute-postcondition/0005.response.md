The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `container` to 0. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `n`, `a`, `total_water`, or `target`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, and `total_water % n` is equal to 0; `target` is `total_water // n`; `container` is 0.**
