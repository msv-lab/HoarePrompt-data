### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a significant flaw in the program: the program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. The program assumes that all input is provided in a single line, which is incorrect. Each test case consists of multiple lines of input, and the program needs to read and process each test case separately.

However, the core logic of the function `func_1` is correct. The logic checks if it's possible to equalize the water levels by ensuring that at no point do we need to take water from a container that doesn't have enough, which would make it impossible to balance the water levels using the allowed operations (pouring from left to right only).

### Corrected Input Handling:
To properly handle multiple test cases, the program needs to read the input line by line and process each test case separately. Here's the corrected version of the input handling part:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1

results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index].split()))
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

### Conclusion:
While the logic within `func_1` is correct, the original program does not correctly handle multiple test cases. Therefore, the program as given is incorrect due to the input handling issue.

**Final: False**
