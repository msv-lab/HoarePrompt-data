### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a significant issue with the program: the program does not handle multiple test cases properly. The input is read in a way that assumes all test cases are provided in a single line, which is not consistent with the problem description. Instead, each test case consists of multiple lines of input.

However, the core logic of the function `func_1` itself is correct. The function correctly calculates the target amount of water each container should have and checks if it is possible to redistribute the water using the allowed operations (pouring from left to right only).

Here's a breakdown of the function `func_1` based on the function summary and the problem description:

1. **Calculate Total Water and Target:**
   - The function calculates the total amount of water in all containers.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have by dividing the total water by the number of containers (`target = total_water // n`).

2. **Check Redistribution Feasibility:**
   - The function iterates through the containers, maintaining a running balance (`container`) of the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point the running balance becomes negative, it means that the current container does not have enough water to meet the target, and it would require water from a previous container, which is not allowed by the operation rules (pouring from left to right only). Hence, the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the balance going negative, it means that it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, so the function returns 'Yes'.

Given that the function logic is correct but the input handling is incorrect, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw. However, it does not state that the function logic itself is correct, which is an important point to consider.

### Final Evaluation

Since the program contains a critical flaw in input handling that prevents it from working correctly for multiple test cases, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**

The program needs to be corrected to properly handle multiple test cases as described in the original assessment.
