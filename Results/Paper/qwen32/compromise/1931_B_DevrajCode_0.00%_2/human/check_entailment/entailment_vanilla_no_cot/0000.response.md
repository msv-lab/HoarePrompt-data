Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw. It only checks if the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the target amount ever becomes negative as it iterates through the list. However, this does not fully capture the problem's requirements. 

The correct approach is to ensure that at no point when pouring water from one container to another, we violate the condition that water can only be poured from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The current implementation does not consider this directionality constraint.

The correct algorithm should ensure that the cumulative sum of water (after adjusting for the target) never goes negative, which is correct, but it should also ensure that water can only be transferred according to the i < j rule. The provided program does not check this rule, so it might incorrectly return 'Yes' for some cases where the transfer rule is violated.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    a = list(map(int, data[index+1:index+1+n]))
    results.append(func_1(n, a))
    index += 1 + n

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This version correctly handles multiple test cases and ensures the logic is applied to each one. However, the original logic for checking the possibility of equalizing water amounts is correct, assuming the directionality constraint is met, which it wasn't properly checked in the original code.
