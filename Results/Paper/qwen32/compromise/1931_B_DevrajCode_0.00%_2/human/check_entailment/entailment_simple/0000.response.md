### Reasoning:

The task is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher amount to a container with a lower amount, but only in the direction where the index of the source container is less than the index of the target container (i.e., i < j).

The provided solution first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers `n`. Since the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, this check is redundant but does not affect correctness.

The key part of the solution is the loop where it iterates over each container, adjusting the `container` variable by the difference between the current container's water amount and the `target` amount (which is the equal amount of water each container should have if the water can be evenly distributed).

The `container` variable keeps track of the cumulative difference between the actual amount of water and the target amount. If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to balance out the current container's excess water, which makes it impossible to achieve the target distribution. Hence, the function returns 'No' in this case.

If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, it means that the water from the previous containers can be used to balance out the water in the current and subsequent containers, and the function returns 'Yes'.

The provided solution correctly implements this logic, and the states described in the comments match the expected behavior of the program.
