Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The logic used in the program is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" and does not handle the removal of characters in a way that minimizes deletions.

Here is a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

- The program simply counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" and then calculates `x + y - z` to determine the number of deletions. This approach does not consider the positions of these substrings and how removing characters from one might affect the presence of others.
- For example, in the string "mapie", the program counts one "map" and one "pie", resulting in a count of 2 deletions, which is incorrect because removing just the 'm' from the string would make it beautiful with only one deletion.
- The program does not account for the fact that removing a character from one instance of "map" or "pie" might make another instance of "map" or "pie" disappear, thus reducing the total number of deletions needed.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that considers the positions of "map" and "pie" and how removing characters affects the overall string.
