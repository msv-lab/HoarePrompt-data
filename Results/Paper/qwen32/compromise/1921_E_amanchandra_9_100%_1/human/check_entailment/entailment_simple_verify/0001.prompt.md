You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's examine the provided program and see if it correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the rules described.

### Analysis

1. **Understand the Game Rules:**
   - Alice can move down, down-left, or down-right.
   - Bob can move up, up-left, or up-right.
   - Alice wins if she lands on Bob's position.
   - Bob wins if he lands on Alice's position.
   - The game ends in a draw if neither player can make a move or if they can't reach each other.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Alice's position is `(a, b)`, Bob's position is `(c, d)`.
   - Alice wins if she can reach Bob's position before Bob reaches Alice's position.
   - If Alice is initially above Bob (`a < c`), she has a chance to win.
   - If Alice is initially on the same row or below Bob (`a >= c`), the game will end in a draw unless certain positions allow Alice to catch up in one move.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - If `a > c`, Alice cannot move up to Bob's row, so the game is a draw.
   - If `a < c`, Alice can potentially move towards Bob.
     - Compute `x = abs(a - c) // 2`: This is the maximum number of rows Alice can move towards Bob.
     - If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true (i.e., `a - c` is odd), Alice can move to a range of columns `[max(1, d - x), min(w, d + x)]` in the row `a + x`.
       - Check if Bob can move to any of these columns in his next move. If not, Alice wins.
     - If `abs(a - c) % 2` is false (i.e., `a - c` is even), Alice can move to a range of columns `[max(1, b - x), min(w, b + x)]` in the row `a + x`.
       - Check if Bob can move to any of these columns in his next move. If not, Bob wins.

4. **Program Implementation:**
   - The program correctly computes the ranges and checks if the players can move to those positions.
   - The ternary-like syntax `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition])` and `print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[condition])` is used to print the result based on the conditions.

### Conclusion

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the game's outcome based on the provided rules and observations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **True**
