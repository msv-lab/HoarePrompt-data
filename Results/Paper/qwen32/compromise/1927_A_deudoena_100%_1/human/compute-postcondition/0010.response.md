Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' or 'B'. It returns `ma - mi + 2` for each test case, where `ma` is the 0-indexed position of the last 'B' in the string `s`, and `mi` is the 0-indexed position of the first 'B' in the string `s`.**
