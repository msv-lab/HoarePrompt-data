You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that there is at least one 'B' in the string s.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s` (1-indexed), `m` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `c` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s` (1-indexed), `d` is 0, and `l` is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: ma is the 0-indexed position of the last 'B' in s, mi is unchanged, m is unchanged, s is unchanged, c is unchanged, d is the distance from the end of the string to the last 'B', l is an empty list.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the 0-indexed position of the last 'B' in the string `s`, and `mi` is unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' or 'B'. It returns `ma - mi + 2` for each test case, where `ma` is the 0-indexed position of the last 'B' in the string `s`, and `mi` is the 0-indexed position of the first 'B' in the string `s`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the 0-indexed position of the last 'B' in the string `s`, and `mi` is unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
