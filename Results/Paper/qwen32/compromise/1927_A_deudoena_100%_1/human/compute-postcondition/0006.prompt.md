Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that there is at least one 'B' in the string s. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string for the current test case, `c` is 0, `d` is 0, and `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in s:
    c += 1
    if j == 'B':
        mi = c
        break


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
