### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells in the strip white. The logic used in `func_1()` is incorrect for this purpose.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function calculates the length of the substring from the first 'B' to the last 'B' and adds 2 to it. This does not necessarily give the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white. For example, in the string "WBBWBW", the first 'B' is at index 1 (0-indexed) and the last 'B' is at index 4. The function calculates `4 - 1 + 2 = 5`, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 4, as painting from index 1 to 4 (inclusive) will turn all cells white.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The function does not consider the possibility of a more optimal segment that might include some 'W' cells but still results in all cells being white with a smaller segment length.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
