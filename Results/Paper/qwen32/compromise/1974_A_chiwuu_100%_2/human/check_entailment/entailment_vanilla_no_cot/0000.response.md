Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to fit the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid. Let's break down the issues in the code:

1. **Calculation of 2x2 Icons:**
   - The code attempts to calculate how many screens are needed for the 2x2 icons by dividing `b` by 2 and rounding up. However, this approach doesn't account for the actual placement of 2x2 icons on the 5x3 grid, which has specific constraints.

2. **Placement of 1x1 Icons:**
   - The code then calculates the remaining space for 1x1 icons but incorrectly assumes that the remaining space can be filled without considering the actual grid layout and the fact that some cells may be blocked by 2x2 icons.

3. **Grid Constraints:**
   - The code does not account for the fact that a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and can only be placed in specific positions on the 5x3 grid. There are only 5 possible positions for a 2x2 icon on a 5x3 grid:
     - Top-left corner
     - Top-middle
     - Top-right
     - Middle-left
     - Middle-middle
   - The code should check if the 2x2 icons can be placed in these positions and then calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons accordingly.

4. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The logic `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` and the subsequent calculations do not accurately reflect the problem constraints.

A correct approach would involve:
- First, trying to place as many 2x2 icons as possible on the grid, considering the valid positions.
- Then, calculating the remaining space for 1x1 icons and determining how many additional screens are needed based on the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Maximum 2x2 icons that can fit on one screen
        max_2x2_per_screen = 2  # Only two 2x2 icons can fit on a 5x3 grid
        
        screens = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons first
        screens += b // max_2x2_per_screen
        remaining_2x2 = b % max_2x2_per_screen
        
        # Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        if remaining_2x2 == 0:
            remaining_cells = 15
        elif remaining_2x2 == 1:
            remaining_cells = 11  # One 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells
        else:  # remaining_2x2 == 2
            remaining_cells = 7   # Two 2x2 icons occupy 8 cells, leaving 7 cells
        
        # Place 1x1 icons in the remaining cells
        if a > remaining_cells:
            screens += (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15  # Add screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons
        
        print(screens)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the 2x2 icons are placed optimally and then calculates the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
