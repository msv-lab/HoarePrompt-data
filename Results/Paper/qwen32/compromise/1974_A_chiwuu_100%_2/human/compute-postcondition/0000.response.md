The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that the function receives an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it receives two integers `x` and `y`. The variable `n` is introduced and assigned the value of the input, which should be equal to `t` as per the precondition.

Output State: **The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, the function receives two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively; `n` is assigned the value of `t`.**
