In the provided task, the for loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is assigned the value of `t`. The variables `x` and `y` are mentioned as inputs for each test case but are not directly involved in the loop head. Therefore, the only variables we can adjust to ensure the loop executes are `i` and `n`.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1 because `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration, continuing as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is 0**
