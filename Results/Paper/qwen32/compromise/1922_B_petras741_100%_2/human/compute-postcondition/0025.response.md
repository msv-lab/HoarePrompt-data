Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer such that n >= 3 (and 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `eta` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to n for which `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `eta` will contain all the unique values from the list `w` (i.e., all indices `j` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0). The values of `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `buffer`, and `w` remain unchanged. The variable `j` will have the value `n + 1` after the loop completes.
