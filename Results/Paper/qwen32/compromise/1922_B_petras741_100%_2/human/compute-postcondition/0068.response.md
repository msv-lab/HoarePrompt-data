The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is a non-negative integer. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 1, and `n` must be at least 1 (since `j` ranges from 0 to `n` inclusive).

State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, and if `q[0]` is greater than 0, `eta` contains the value 0**
