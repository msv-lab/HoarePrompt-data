To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code itself.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that n >= 3 and 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n.
- `buffer` is an empty list.
- `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers.
- `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `eta` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to n for which `q[j]` is greater than 0.
- `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`.
- `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. The length of `eta` (denoted as `eta_ln`) is 1.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

### Explanation:
The print statement calculates and prints the value of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`. This expression is a well-known formula for calculating the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time, often denoted as \( C(n, 3) \) or \( \binom{n}{3} \).

The formula for combinations is:
\[ C(n, 3) = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} \]

Since the expression in the print statement is using integer division (`//`), the result will be an integer.

### Output:
The output will be the integer value of \( \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} \).

Thus, the final output is:
Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (which is the number of combinations of n items taken 3 at a time)**

However, since we need to strictly adhere to the format Output: **what is printed**, we can write:

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6**
