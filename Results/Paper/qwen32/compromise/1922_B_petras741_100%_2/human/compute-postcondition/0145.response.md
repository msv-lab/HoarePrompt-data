Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `i` is `k + 2`. If `n` >= 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is the count of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing all unique values in `w`, `eta_ln` is the number of unique values in `w`, `rho` is the count of the first unique value in `w` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the sum of the counts of all unique values in `w`, and `res` is calculated as the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for all unique values in `w`, plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all unique values in `w` if `eta_ln` is greater than 1. If `n` < 3, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, and `res` remain unchanged.**
