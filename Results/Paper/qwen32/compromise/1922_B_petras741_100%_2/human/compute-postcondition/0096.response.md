Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer and `n` is less than 3, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and other variables remain unchanged.**
