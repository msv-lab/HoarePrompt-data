To determine the final output state after the loop completes all `n + 1` iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = n`, and for each `j`, it checks if `q[j]` is greater than 0. If it is, the value `j` is appended to the list `eta`.

Given the pattern from the first three iterations, we can infer that after all `n + 1` iterations, `eta` will contain all values `j` from `0` to `n` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0. 

Here's the final output state:

Output State: **`eta` contains all values `j` from `0` to `n` for which `q[j] > 0`.**

In simpler terms, `eta` will be a list of indices where the corresponding values in `q` are greater than 0, after the loop has finished executing all `n + 1` iterations.
