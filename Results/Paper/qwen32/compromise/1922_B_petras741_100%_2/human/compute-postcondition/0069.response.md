The code appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given that `j` is 1, the list `eta` will have 1 added to it. The initial state specifies that if `q[0]` is greater than 0, `eta` initially contains the value 0. After appending `j` (which is 1), `eta` will now contain the values `[0, 1]` if `q[0]` was greater than 0, or simply `[1]` if `eta` was initially empty.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, and if `q[0]` is greater than 0, `eta` contains the values [0, 1], otherwise `eta` contains the value [1]**.
