Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of `int(input())`. The other variables (`n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the code snippet provided.
