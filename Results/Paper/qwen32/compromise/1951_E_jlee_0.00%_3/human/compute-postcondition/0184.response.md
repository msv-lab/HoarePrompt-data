Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` for some `j` in the range from 0 to \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\), otherwise `done` remains `False`; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0; `j` is the loop variable iterating from 0 to \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\). If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` for any `j`, the loop is broken and `done` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `done` remains `False`.**
