The given code snippet is:

```
done = True
```

This line of code sets the variable `done` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `done` is `True`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable, `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `count` and `count2` are integers, `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1, `done` is True.**
