Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable; `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `count2` is equal to `count`; `count` is greater than 1; `done` is `True`. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the variable `done` has been explicitly set to `True`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
