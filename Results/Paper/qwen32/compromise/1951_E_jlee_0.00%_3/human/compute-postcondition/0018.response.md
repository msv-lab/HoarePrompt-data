Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is a loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand.
3. `string` is an input string.
4. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. `n` is the length of `string`.
6. `done` is `False`.
7. `x` is the first character of `string`.
8. All characters in `s` are equal to `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Output:
Based on the code snippet and the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
