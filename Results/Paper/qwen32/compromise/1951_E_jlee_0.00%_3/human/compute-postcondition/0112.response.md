Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable; `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j] != x`, `count` is set to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count2` equals `count`, `done` is `True` if `count > 1`, and `count2` is 0 if `count > 1`. If `count2` does not equal `count` and `count2` is not greater than `count`, `done` remains `False`. If `s[j] == x`, then `count2` is set to 1 if it was 0, or 2 if it was 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains `False`. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count`, `count2`, or `done`.**
