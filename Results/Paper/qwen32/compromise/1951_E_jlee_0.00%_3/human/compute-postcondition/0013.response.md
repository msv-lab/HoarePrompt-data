The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides several variables and conditions, but these do not influence the output of the `print(1)` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, and `x`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. The variable `i` is a loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand.
3. The variable `string` is an input string.
4. The variable `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. The variable `n` is the length of `string`.
6. The variable `done` is `False`.
7. The variable `x` is the first character of `string` and is not equal to the last character of `string`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print(1)` statement. The statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(1)` statement is:

Output: **1**
