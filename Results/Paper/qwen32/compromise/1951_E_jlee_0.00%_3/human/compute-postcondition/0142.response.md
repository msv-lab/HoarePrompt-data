Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable, `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `count` and `count2` are integers, `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1. If `count2 > 0` and `count2 < count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count2` equals `count`, `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1 or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `count2` does not equal `count`, `done` is True if `count2` is greater than `count`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. If `count` is not greater than 1, `count2` is 0.**
