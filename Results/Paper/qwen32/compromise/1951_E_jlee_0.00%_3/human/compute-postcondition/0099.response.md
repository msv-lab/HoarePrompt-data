Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable; `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `count2` is 0; `j` is the current value of the loop variable incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains `False`. `count` is `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.**

In this output state, the only change is that `count2` has been explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
