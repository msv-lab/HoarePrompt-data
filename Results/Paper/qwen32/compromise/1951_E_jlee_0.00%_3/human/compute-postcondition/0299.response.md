Postcondition: **`done` is False, `j` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, `count` and `count2` reflect the state after the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `string` is the user input, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `string`. If `n` is equal to 1, the conditions described remain unchanged.**
