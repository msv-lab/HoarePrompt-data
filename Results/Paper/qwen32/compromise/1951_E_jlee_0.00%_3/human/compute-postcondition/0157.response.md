The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the state of the program outside of the loop. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string`; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is `False`; `count` and `count2` are integers based on the loop conditions; `j` is the loop variable iterating from 0 to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.**
