Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string`; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is `False`; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0; `j` is the loop variable iterating from 0 to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. If `s.count(x) == n`, the conditions remain the same as described in the precondition. Otherwise, if `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the conditions remain as specified.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`. If `count` is greater than 0, indicating that `s[j]` was not equal to `x` for some `j` before the loop was broken, then `count2` is incremented by 1 for each `s[j]` not equal to `x`. If `count2` equals `count`, `done` is `True` if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `done` is determined by the comparison of `s[j]` and `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is `True`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1. If `count` is 0, the state remains unchanged from the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`. If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count` is set to `j`. If `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is `True`. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is incremented by 1 for each `s[j]` not equal to `x`; if `count2` equals `count`, `done` is `True` if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `done` is determined by the comparison of `s[j]` and `s[n - 1 - j]`; if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is `True`; if `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1. If `count` is 0, the state remains unchanged from the precondition; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Additionally, if `s[j] != x` and `count > 0`, `count2` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, then `count` is set to the value of `j`. If `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count > 0`, `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j] == x` or `count >= 1`. If `count2 > 0` and `count2 < count`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count2 == count` and `count > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count2 == count` and `count <= 1`, `count2` is set to 0. If `count2 != count` and `count2 > count`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count` is 0, no changes are made to `count2` and `done` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
