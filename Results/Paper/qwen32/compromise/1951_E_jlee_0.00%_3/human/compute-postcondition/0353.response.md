Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variable Initialization and Conditions:**
   - `done` is a boolean variable that is set to `True` if the character at position `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at position `n - 1 - j` in `s`. Otherwise, it remains `False`.
   - `j` is initialized to `-1`.
   - `count` and `count2` are integers where `count2` is greater than `count`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `string` is the user input.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1.
   - `x` is the first character of `string`.
   - The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Since `j` is `-1`, `s[j]` refers to the last character of the string.
   - If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the conditions remain unchanged.
   - If `s.count(x) == n` or `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the conditions remain unchanged.
   - If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the conditions remain unchanged.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.
   - Since `j` is `-1`, `string[:j]` will be the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the last character.
   - `string[j:]` will be the substring from the last character to the end of `string`, which is just the last character itself.

3. **Output:**
   - Given the above conditions, the print statement will output the string excluding its last character and then the last character separately.

Thus, the output will be the string without its last character, followed by the last character.

Output: **string without its last character, last character of string**
