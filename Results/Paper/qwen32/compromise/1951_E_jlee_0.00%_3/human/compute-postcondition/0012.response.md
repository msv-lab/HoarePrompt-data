Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Summary:
- `t` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is a loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `done` is `False`.
- `x` is the first character of `string` and is not equal to the last character of `string`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables (`t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`).

### Output:
The `print` statement will simply output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
