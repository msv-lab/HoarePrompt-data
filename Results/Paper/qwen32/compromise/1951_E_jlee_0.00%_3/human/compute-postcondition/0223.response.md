Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`i`**: Incremented by 1 from its previous value.
3. **`string`**: A new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1.
4. **`s`**: A list of characters from the new `string`.
5. **`n`**: The length of the new `string` and must be at least 1.
6. **`x`**: The first character of the new `string`.
7. **`count`**: A variable that indicates how many times `s[j]` was not equal to `x` before the loop was broken.
8. **`count2`**: A variable that counts the number of characters in `s` that are not equal to `x`.
9. **`done`**: A boolean variable whose value depends on the conditions involving `count`, `count2`, and the comparison of characters in `s`.
10. **`j`**: Incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward. Regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, `done`, and `j`, the print statement will always output the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will always output `'YES'`, as the string `'YES'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any of the variables or their values.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
