The code snippet converts the input string `string` into a list of characters and assigns it to the variable `s`. The other variables, `t` and `i`, are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`.**
