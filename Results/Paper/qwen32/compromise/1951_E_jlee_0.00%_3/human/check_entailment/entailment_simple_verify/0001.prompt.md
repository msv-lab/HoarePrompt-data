You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
2. **Output**: For each test case, determine if the string can be partitioned into substrings where each substring is not a palindrome. If possible, output "YES", the number of parts `k`, and the partitioned substrings. If not possible, output "NO".
3. **Constraints**: The sum of lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\).

### Program Analysis:
The given program attempts to solve the problem with the following approach:

1. **Single Character Strings**: If the string length is 1, it directly outputs "NO" because a single character is always a palindrome.
2. **First and Last Character Check**: If the first and last characters of the string are different, it outputs "YES" with the entire string as one partition, because a string with different first and last characters cannot be a palindrome.
3. **All Characters Same**: If all characters in the string are the same, it outputs "NO" because any substring will be a palindrome.
4. **All But One Character Same**: If all but one character are the same, it checks if the middle character (for odd-length strings) is different from the others. If not, it outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES" with the entire string as one partition.
5. **General Case**: For other cases, it iterates through the first half of the string to find a mismatch with the corresponding character from the end. If a mismatch is found, it outputs "YES" with the entire string as one partition. If no mismatch is found but there are different characters, it tries to partition the string into two parts around the first mismatch.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of Palindrome Strings**: The program fails to handle cases where the string is a palindrome but can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings. For example, the string "abccba" is a palindrome but can be partitioned into "abc" and "cba", both of which are not palindromes.
2. **Complexity**: The program uses nested loops and multiple conditions, which can be simplified and optimized.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases, such as strings with repeated patterns or specific character distributions.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program is not correct for all possible cases. It fails to handle cases where a palindrome string can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
