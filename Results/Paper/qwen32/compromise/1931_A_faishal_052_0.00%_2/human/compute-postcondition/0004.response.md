The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the loop iterates over the range of 2. This means the loop will execute if the range function is called with a value that allows for at least two iterations. The range function `range(2)` will always produce two iterations (for `j` values 0 and 1), so no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

However, the task specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and since `j` is the only variable in the loop head, there is no need to adjust any other variable in the state.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustment for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer**
