The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have been incremented from its initial value of 0 to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented again to 1 (which it already is) and then the loop will execute again with `j` being 2, but since the range is up to but not including 2, the loop will terminate after `j` is 1.

However, to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration (which is the second and final iteration of the loop), `j` should be 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing a single element. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is greater than 25, `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is less than 52, then `lex` is an integer between 1 and 26. Otherwise, `lex` is an integer greater than 51, `j` is 1**
