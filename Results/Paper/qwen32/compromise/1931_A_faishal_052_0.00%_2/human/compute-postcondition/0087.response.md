Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
2. `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
3. `i` is 1.
4. `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
5. `arr` is a list sorted in ascending order based on the initial value of `lex`.
6. `lex` is reduced by 2, 27, or 52 based on the initial value of `lex`.
7. `j` is 2.
8. `k` is 2.

### Key Points:
- `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
- `k` is 2, which means we are interested in the third element of the list `arr` (since list indices start at 0).
- The print statement will output the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`.

### Determining `arr[k]`:
- Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order and `k` is 2, `arr[k]` is the third smallest element in the list `arr`.
- However, the exact values of the elements in `arr` are not provided, so we can only describe the output in terms of `arr[2]`.

### Converting to Character:
- The `chr()` function converts an ASCII value to its corresponding character.
- `arr[2] + 96` means we are taking the third smallest element in `arr`, adding 96 to it, and then converting the result to a character.
- For example, if `arr[2]` were 1, then `chr(1 + 96)` would be 'a'. If `arr[2]` were 2, then `chr(2 + 96)` would be 'b', and so on.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can't determine the exact character because `arr[2]` is not explicitly defined. However, we know that `arr[2]` is the third smallest element in a sorted list, and the print statement will output the character corresponding to `arr[2] + 96`.

### Final Output:
Output: **character (where character is chr(arr[2] + 96) and arr[2] is the third smallest element in the sorted list `arr`)**
