Functionality: **The function processes a number of test cases, each with an integer input `lex`. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of three characters based on the value of `lex` and prints these characters. The characters are derived from the English alphabet, where values 1 through 26 correspond to 'a' through 'z', and values 27 through 52 would theoretically correspond to 'a' through 'z' again, but the function does not handle values above 52 correctly as per the given code. The final state of the program is that it has printed the results for all test cases.**
