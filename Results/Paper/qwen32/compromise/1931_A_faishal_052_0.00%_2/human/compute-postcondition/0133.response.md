To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's break down the loop's behavior and how the variables evolve.

### Loop Behavior Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The loop runs `cases` times, with each iteration processing a value `lex` (input integer) and generating three characters based on `lex`.

2. **Processing per Iteration**:
   - For each iteration, `lex` is processed in two steps:
     - If `lex <= 26`, it appends `1` to `arr` and reduces `lex` by `1`.
     - If `26 < lex < 52`, it appends `26` to `arr` and reduces `lex` by `26`.
     - If `lex >= 52`, it appends `26` to `arr` and reduces `lex` by `26`.
   - After processing `lex` twice, the remaining `lex` is appended to `arr`.
   - The `arr` is then sorted.
   - Finally, the first three elements of the sorted `arr` are converted to characters and printed.

3. **Loop Completion**:
   - After all `cases` iterations, the loop terminates, and the final state is determined by the number of iterations (`cases`).

### Output State after All Iterations:
- **Variables**:
  - `t`: Remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 100).
  - `cases`: Remains unchanged (initial value, which determines the number of iterations).
  - `i`: Ends at `cases - 1` (the last iteration index).
  - `n`: Remains unchanged (3 <= n <= 78, but not directly used in the loop body).
  - `arr`: The `arr` is reset for each iteration, so its final state is the `arr` from the last iteration.
  - `lex`: The `lex` value from the last iteration, modified based on the processing rules.
  - `j`: Ends at `2` (since the inner loop runs exactly 2 times per iteration).
  - `k`: Ends at `3` (since the innermost loop runs exactly 3 times per iteration).

### Final Output State:
- **Output State**: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, cases is an integer representing the total number of test cases, i is equal to cases - 1, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, arr is the sorted array from the last iteration based on the last lex value, lex is the reduced value from the last iteration, j is 2, k is 3.**

This output state reflects the final state of the loop after processing all `cases` iterations. The `arr` and `lex` values are specific to the last iteration, while other variables like `t`, `cases`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are determined by the loop's overall execution.
