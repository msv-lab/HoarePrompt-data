Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an input integer, `lex` is greater than 26, and the current value of `lex` is less than 52.**

Explanation: The only change is that the list `arr` now contains the integer 26. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
