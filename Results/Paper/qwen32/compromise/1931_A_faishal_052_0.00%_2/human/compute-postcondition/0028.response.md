Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was initially less than or equal to 25, or `[26, 26, 1]` if `lex` was initially greater than 25, `lex` is modified to be between -26 and 50 if it was initially between 1 and 51, or greater than 25 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1, `lex` is now `lex - 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `lex` is decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged except for `lex`, which is now one less than its initial value, while still adhering to the constraints described for its initial value.
