To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
2. **cases**: Greater than or equal to 2.
3. **i**: Set to 2.
4. **n**: An integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
5. **arr**: A list that can be one of the following:
   - [1, 1, lex]
   - [lex, 1, 1]
   - [1, lex, 26]
   - [lex, 1, 26]
   - [1, 26, lex]
   - [lex, 26, 26]
   - [26, 26, lex]
6. **lex**: Adjusted to be in the range -25 to 51.
7. **j**: Set to 2.
8. **k**: Set to 3.

### Focusing on the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Analysis:
- `arr[k]` refers to the element at index `k` in the list `arr`. Since `k` is 3, and Python uses zero-based indexing, `arr[k]` is actually `arr[2]`.
- `arr[2]` can be `lex`, `1`, `26`, or any other integer value based on the possible configurations of `arr` listed in the initial state.
- The function `chr(x)` converts an integer `x` to its corresponding ASCII character.
- The expression `arr[2] + 96` means that the integer value of `arr[2]` will be added to 96 before converting it to a character.

### Possible Values of `arr[2]`:
- If `arr[2]` is `lex`, then `lex` is adjusted to be in the range -25 to 51.
- If `arr[2]` is `1`, then `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which corresponds to the character `'a'`.
- If `arr[2]` is `26`, then `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which corresponds to the character `'z'`.

### Considering the Range of `lex`:
- If `lex` is in the range -25 to 51:
  - If `lex` is -25, `chr(-25 + 96)` is `chr(71)`, which corresponds to the character `'G'`.
  - If `lex` is 0, `chr(0 + 96)` is `chr(96)`, which corresponds to the character backtick (`` ` ``).
  - If `lex` is 51, `chr(51 + 96)` is `chr(147)`, which corresponds to the character `â€˜` (a left single quotation mark).

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement depends on the value of `arr[2]`. Given the possible configurations of `arr` and the range of `lex`, the output could be any character corresponding to the ASCII values derived from `arr[2] + 96`.

### Final Output:
Output: **character (where character is the ASCII character corresponding to arr[2] + 96)**
