The loop provided in the code is set to iterate exactly 2 times because the range in the `for` loop is `range(2)`, which means `j` will take values 0 and 1. Therefore, the loop will not execute 3 times as described in the output states for 1, 2, and 3 iterations. The loop will only execute twice.

Let's analyze the loop's effect on the variables:

1. **First Iteration (`j = 0`)**:
   - If `lex <= 26`, `arr` becomes `[1]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 1`.
   - If `26 < lex < 52`, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.
   - If `lex >= 52`, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.

2. **Second Iteration (`j = 1`)**:
   - The same logic applies as in the first iteration. Depending on the value of `lex` after the first iteration, `arr` will be extended by either `1` or `26`, and `lex` will be adjusted accordingly.

After the second iteration, the loop ends, and we need to determine the final state of `arr` and `lex` based on the initial value of `lex`.

### Final Output State Analysis:
- **If `lex <= 26` initially**:
  - After the first iteration: `arr = [1]`, `lex = lex - 1`.
  - After the second iteration: `arr = [1, 1]` if `lex - 1 <= 26`, or `arr = [1, 26]` if `lex - 1 > 26` (which is not possible since `lex <= 26` initially).
  - Final `lex` will be `lex - 2`.

- **If `26 < lex < 52` initially**:
  - After the first iteration: `arr = [26]`, `lex = lex - 26`.
  - After the second iteration: `arr = [26, 1]` if `lex - 26 <= 26`, or `arr = [26, 26]` if `lex - 26 > 26` (which is not possible since `lex < 52` initially).
  - Final `lex` will be `lex - 27`.

- **If `lex >= 52` initially**:
  - After the first iteration: `arr = [26]`, `lex = lex - 26`.
  - After the second iteration: `arr = [26, 1]` if `lex - 26 <= 26`, or `arr = [26, 26]` if `lex - 26 > 26`.
  - Final `lex` will be `lex - 27` or `lex - 52` depending on whether `lex - 26` is less than or equal to 26 or greater than 26.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1], [26, 1], [26, 26] depending on the initial value of `lex`, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range -25 to 51 based on its original value, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3.**

In simpler terms, the final `arr` will be `[1, 1]` if `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, `[26, 1]` if `lex` was between 27 and 51, and `[26, 26]` if `lex` was 52 or greater. The final value of `lex` will be adjusted based on the initial value of `lex` as described.
