The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, but since the range is `range(2)`, the loop will not execute again after `j` is incremented to 2.

However, since the task asks for the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the state right before the loop condition fails. Therefore, we adjust `j` to 2, which is the start of the next iteration that would fail the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing either the integer 1 or the integer 26 with an additional 1 appended if `lex` <= 26, or an additional 26 appended if `lex` > 26, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 minus 1 if `lex` <= 26, or minus 26 if `lex` > 26, `j` is 2, `k` is 3**
