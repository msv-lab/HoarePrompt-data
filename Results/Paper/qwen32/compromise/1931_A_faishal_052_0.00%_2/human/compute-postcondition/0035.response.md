The loop provided runs for `j` in the range of 2, meaning it will execute exactly 2 times. Given this, the loop will not execute more than 2 times regardless of the value of `lex`. Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop (i.e., after 2 iterations) is the same as the output state after the loop executes 2 times.

Here is the detailed breakdown:

- **Initial State**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
- **Loop Execution**:
  - **First Iteration**:
    - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` gets `1` appended, and `lex` is reduced by 1.
    - If `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` gets `26` appended, and `lex` is reduced by 26.
    - If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` gets `26` appended, and `lex` is reduced by 26.
  - **Second Iteration**:
    - The same logic as the first iteration is applied, resulting in another element being appended to `arr` based on the updated value of `lex`.

Since the loop runs exactly 2 times, the final state will be:

- `arr` will contain two elements.
- If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 25, `arr` will be `[1, 1]` and `lex` will be `lex - 2`.
- If `lex` was initially between 26 and 51, `arr` will be `[26, 1]` and `lex` will be `lex - 52`.
- If `lex` was initially 52 or greater, `arr` will be `[26, 26]` and `lex` will be `lex - 52`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 1 if `lex` (initially) is less than or equal to 25, or 26 if `lex` (initially) is greater than 25, and the second element is 1 if `lex` was initially between 1 and 26, or 26 otherwise, `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 51, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 51 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1.**
