The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust these variables accordingly.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `cases` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `cases` should remain the same or be greater than the new `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1, and `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1 (which it already is).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is sorted based on the initial value of `lex` (either `[1, 1, lex]` if lex is between 1 and 25, `[lex - 26, 26, 26]` if lex is between 26 and 51, or `[26, 26, lex]` if lex is greater than 51), `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 51, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 51 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**
