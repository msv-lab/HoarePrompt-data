Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is sorted based on the initial value of `lex` (either `[1, 1, lex]` if lex is between 1 and 25, `[lex - 26, 26, 26]` if lex is between 26 and 51, or `[26, 26, lex]` if lex is greater than 51), `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 51, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 51 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1, `k` is 3`**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `k` will have a value of 3, indicating that the loop has completed its three iterations. All other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `lex`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states or as defined by the loop's precondition.
