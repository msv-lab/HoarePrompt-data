Reasoning: 
The provided program is intended to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given encoded integer `n`. However, there are issues in the logic of the program that prevent it from correctly determining the smallest word.

1. **Handling of Values Greater Than 26:**
   - The program only considers values up to 52 and incorrectly handles values above 52. It simply subtracts 26 twice if the value is more than 26, which is not the correct method to determine the smallest word. For example, if `lex` is 70, it should be broken down into values that sum to 70 and correspond to the smallest letters in the alphabet.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program sorts the array of values after determining them, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest word, and sorting can disrupt the order of the letters.

3. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic to determine the values of the letters is flawed. The program should iteratively subtract the smallest possible values from `lex` while ensuring that the remaining value can still be split into two valid letter values. This is not correctly implemented in the given code.

Here's a correct approach to solve the problem:
- Start by assigning the smallest possible value (1) to the first letter.
- Then, assign the smallest possible value to the second letter, ensuring the remaining value can still be a valid letter.
- Finally, the remaining value is assigned to the third letter.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n`.

Correctness: **False**
