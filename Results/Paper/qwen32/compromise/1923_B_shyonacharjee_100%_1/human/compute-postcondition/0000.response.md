Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `x` is a list of n integers where each integer x_i satisfies -n <= x_i <= n, x_i != 0, and the list x is strictly increasing (i.e., x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, while the other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the provided code snippet.
