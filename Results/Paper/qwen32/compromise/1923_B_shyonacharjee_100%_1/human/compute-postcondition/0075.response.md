Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples based on the absolute value of the first element of each tuple and must have at least one tuple, `bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is `False`, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`, and `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`. The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
