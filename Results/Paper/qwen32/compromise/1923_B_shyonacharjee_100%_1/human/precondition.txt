t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. x is a list of n integers where each element x_i satisfies -n ≤ x_i ≤ n, x_i ≠ 0, and the elements of x are strictly increasing. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
