You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        bullets_used = 0
        can_survive = True
        for (pos, health) in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, a list `a` of integers representing monster health, and a list `x` of integers representing monster positions. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters using bullets, where the number of bullets needed for each monster is equal to its health, and the total number of bullets used cannot exceed `k` times the distance to the monster. The function outputs 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated under these conditions, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Program Analysis

The program is designed to determine whether you can survive and kill all the monsters before they reach your character. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the number of bullets `k` you can fire per second. It also reads the health `a` and positions `x` of the monsters.

2. **Sorting Monsters**: The monsters are sorted based on their distance from the character (i.e., by the absolute value of their positions).

3. **Simulation**:
    - The program iterates through the sorted list of monsters.
    - For each monster, it calculates the total bullets needed to kill the monster (`bullets_used + health`).
    - It checks if the total bullets needed exceed the maximum number of bullets that can be used before the monster reaches the character (`distance * k`).
    - If the total bullets needed exceed this limit, the program concludes that survival is not possible and breaks out of the loop.
    - Otherwise, it updates the total bullets used.

4. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if all monsters can be killed before they reach the character, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Potential Issues

The program seems to follow the problem description, but let's consider some edge cases:

1. **Monsters with the Same Distance**:
    - The program sorts monsters by their distance, but it does not account for the order of monsters with the same distance. If two monsters have the same distance, the order in which they are processed can affect the outcome. However, since the problem does not specify the order of processing for monsters at the same distance, this might not be an issue.

2. **Monsters Moving Simultaneously**:
    - The program assumes that the bullets are used optimally and that the monsters move simultaneously after the bullets are fired. This is consistent with the problem description.

3. **Edge Case with Maximum Values**:
    - The program should handle the maximum values for `n` and `k` as specified in the problem constraints. Given the constraints, the program should be efficient enough to handle the worst-case scenarios.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Provided Example

**Input:**
```
5
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
2 1
1 1
-1 1
4 10
3 4 2 5
-3 -2 1 3
5 3
2 1 3 2 5
-3 -2 3 4 5
2 1
1 2
1 2
```

**Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
YES
NO
```

The program produces the expected output for the provided examples.

#### Additional Edge Cases

**Case 1:**
```
1
1 1
1
1
```
**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```
**Explanation:**
- There is one monster with health 1 at position 1. You can kill it with one bullet before it reaches you.

**Case 2:**
```
1
1 1
2
-1
```
**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```
**Explanation:**
- There is one monster with health 2 at position -1. You can kill it with one bullet, but it will move closer after the first shot and kill you in the next second.

**Case 3:**
```
1
2 1
1 1
1 2
```
**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```
**Explanation:**
- There are two monsters, both with health 1. You can kill one monster per second, but the second monster will reach you before you can kill it.

The program correctly handles these additional edge cases.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing it with various cases, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent issues with the program's logic or handling of edge cases.

Correctness: **True**. The program correctly determines whether you can survive and kill all the monsters before they reach your character for every potential case.
