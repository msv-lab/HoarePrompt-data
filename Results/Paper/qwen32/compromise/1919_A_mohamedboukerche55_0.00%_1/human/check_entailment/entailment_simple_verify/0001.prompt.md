You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: t is unchanged, and a and b are the integers from the last line of input.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: `t` is unchanged, and `a` and `b` are the integers from the last line of input. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the given sample inputs and outputs.

### Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the two integers `a` and `b` which represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it outputs "bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it outputs "alice".

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the name of the winner for each test case.

### Correctness of the Logic

The logic in the program is based on the observation that the game is essentially a simple parity game. Here's why:

- **Even Sum Case:** If `a + b` is even, then both players will eventually run out of coins at the same time if they play optimally. Since Bob always plays after Alice, Alice will be the one who cannot make a move first, hence Bob wins.
- **Odd Sum Case:** If `a + b` is odd, then one player will have one more turn than the other. Since Alice goes first, she will be the one to make the last move, hence she wins.

### Issues in the Provided Program

1. **Indentation Error:**
   - The `if` and `else` statements are incorrectly indented. They should be inside the loop that processes each test case. As it is, the program only considers the last test case and prints the result `t` times.

2. **Output Spacing:**
   - The program prints "bob  " with an extra space. It should print "Bob" without any extra spaces.

### Corrected Program

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has logical correctness in determining the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`, but it has issues with indentation and output formatting. After correcting these issues, the program becomes correct.

Correctness: **False** (due to indentation and output formatting issues)

However, if we consider only the logic and ignore the formatting and indentation issues, the logic is correct.

For the purpose of this task, considering the exact code provided:

Correctness: **False**
