### Reasoning:

The provided code snippet is intended to determine the winner of the game based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The logic used in the code is based on the observation that the player who starts the game (Alice) will win if the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, and the second player (Bob) will win if the total number of coins is even. This is because:

- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of coins, eventually making Bob the one who cannot make a move.
- If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a position where she faces an odd number of coins, eventually making Alice the one who cannot make a move.

However, there is a mistake in the code. The current implementation prints the result for all test cases based only on the last test case's values of `a` and `b`. This is because the `if-else` block is outside the loop that processes each test case. As a result, the program only outputs the result for the last test case, repeated `t` times.

To fix this, the `if-else` block should be inside the loop that processes each test case. Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
        if ((a + b) % 2 == 0):
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Correctness: False
```

Since the original code does not correctly handle all test cases and only outputs the result for the last test case, it is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
