The given loop reads `t` lines of input, where each line contains two integers `a` and `b`. The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads a line, splits it into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. After the loop finishes, the values of `a` and `b` will be the values from the last line of input because they are overwritten in each iteration.

Output State: **t is unchanged, and a and b are the integers from the last line of input.**
