The code snippet assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` now holds the values that `temp` contained, which are `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`. The variables `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` contains `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` based on the value of `c`; `ans` is now equal to `temp`; `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` remain unchanged.**
