The code snippet converts the variable `r`, which is the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `c`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `ans` is `x`**.
