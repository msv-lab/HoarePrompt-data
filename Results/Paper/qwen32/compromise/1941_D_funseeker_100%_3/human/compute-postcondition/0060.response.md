Output State: **`temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n` and possibly other elements based on the initial state of `c`. `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `r` is an integer value returned by `func_1().split()`. `q` is the next element in `ans`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The set `temp` now includes the element `(q + r) % n`. The other elements in `temp` depend on the initial value of `c`. If `c` was '1', `temp` originally contained `(q - r) % n`. If `c` was '?', `temp` originally contained both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` was '0', `temp` was originally empty. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` have not changed. The variable `r` is an integer obtained from `func_1().split()`, and `q` is the next element in `ans`.
