Output State: **`temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`; `n`, `m`, `x`, and `c` remain unchanged; `c` is either '0' or '?'; `ans` is a set with at least one element; `r` is an integer value returned by `func_1().split()`**

The set `temp` now contains the new element `(q + r) % n`. All other variables retain their initial states and values.
