The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` will assign the first value returned by `func_1().split()` to `r` and the second value to `c`. Given that `r` was initially an integer such that `1 <= r <= n - 1`, and `c` was a character that could be '0', '1', or '?', the new values of `r` and `c` will be the values returned by `func_1().split()`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()`, `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `ans` is `x`**.
