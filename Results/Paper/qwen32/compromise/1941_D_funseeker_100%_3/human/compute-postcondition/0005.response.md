The code snippet provided only initializes a new variable `temp` as an empty set. None of the existing variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`, `ans`) are modified. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `ans` is `x`, `temp` is an empty set**.
