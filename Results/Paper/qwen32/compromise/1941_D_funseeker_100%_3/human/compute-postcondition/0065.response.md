The code adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given the initial state, `temp`'s contents depend on the value of `c`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is initially an empty set. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '?', `temp` also contains `(q + r) % n` initially. After executing the line `temp.add((q + r) % n)`, the set `temp` will definitely contain `(q + r) % n`. If `c` was '0', `temp` will now contain only `(q + r) % n`. If `c` was '1', `temp` will contain both `(q - r) % n` and `(q + r) % n`. If `c` was '?', `temp` will still contain both `(q - r) % n` and `(q + r) % n` since `(q + r) % n` is already in `temp`.

Output State: **`temp` contains `(q + r) % n` and if `c` was '1', it also contains `(q - r) % n`; `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `r` is an integer value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `q` is the next element in `ans`.**
