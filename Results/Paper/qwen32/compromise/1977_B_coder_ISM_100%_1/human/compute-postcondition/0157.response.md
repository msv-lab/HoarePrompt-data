The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `length`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

From the description, we know:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The loop runs as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `length - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `length` is greater than 1.
- `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again, and `length` remains the same (since it's the upper bound of the range).

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `i_prev + 1`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `i_prev + 1` at the start of the next iteration. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `length`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- `length` remains the same and is still greater than 1.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can express the state in terms of `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
