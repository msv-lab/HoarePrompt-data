To determine the postcondition, we need to consider the precondition and negate the if condition. The if condition is `(x & pow(2, i))`. The negation of this condition would be `not (x & pow(2, i))`, which means the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `pow(2, i)` results in 0.

Given the precondition:
- The list `s` is an empty list `[]`.
- `length` is 30.
- `nalla` is 3.
- `t` must be greater than 3.
- `x` is an input integer.

The postcondition must include all these details and also specify that the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `pow(2, i)` results in 0.

Postcondition: **The list `s` is an empty list `[]`; `length` is 30; `nalla` is 3; `t` is greater than 3; `x` is an input integer such that the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `pow(2, i)` is 0.**
