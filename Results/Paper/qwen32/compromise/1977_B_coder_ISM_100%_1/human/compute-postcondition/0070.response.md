Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30 if `flag` is 0 and `s[29]` is '0', or `length` is 31 if `flag` is not 0, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, with '-1' replacing the first of any consecutive '1's and '0' replacing the second of those consecutive '1's, except `s[29]` which is '1' if `flag` is not 0, and the 31st element is '1' if `flag` is not 0, `flag` is not 0 if the if condition is met, either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'. If `s[i]` is '0' and `s[i - 1]` is '-1', then `s[i]` remains '0' and `s[i - 1]` remains '-1'.**
