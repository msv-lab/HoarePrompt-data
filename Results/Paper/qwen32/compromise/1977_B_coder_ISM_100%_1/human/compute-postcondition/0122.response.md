The given code snippet only modifies the value of the variable `flag`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x` except `s[i]` is now `'-1'`, `flag` is 1, `i` is `i + 1` where 0 ≤ `i` < 28.**
