The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of the element at index `i` in the list `s` from `'1'` to `'-1'`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x` except `s[i]` is now `'-1'`, `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is `'-1'` and `s[i + 1]` is `'1'`.**
