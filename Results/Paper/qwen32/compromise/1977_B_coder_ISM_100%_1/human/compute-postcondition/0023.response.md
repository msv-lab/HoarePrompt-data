The code snippet `s[i] = '1'` changes the value of the element at index `i` in the list `s` from `'0'` to `'1'`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `x` is the input integer
- `nalla` is not yet initialized
- `length` is 30
- `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set
- `flag` is 1
- `i` is 0
- `s[i]` is '0'

After executing `s[i] = '1'`, the element at index `i` (which is 0) in the list `s` is now '1'. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where the first element is '1' and the rest are '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, `flag` is 1, `i` is 0**
