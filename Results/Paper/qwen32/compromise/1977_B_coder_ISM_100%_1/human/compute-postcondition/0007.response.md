Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `s` is a list containing one element '1', `length` is 30, and the `i`-th bit of `x` is set (i.e., `(x & pow(2, i))` is true).**

Explanation: The list `s` now contains one element, which is the string '1'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
