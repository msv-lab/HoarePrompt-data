Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x` except `s[i]` is now '1', `flag` is not 0.**

In simple terms, the value at index `i` in the list `s` has been changed from '0' to '1'. All other variables retain their initial values.
