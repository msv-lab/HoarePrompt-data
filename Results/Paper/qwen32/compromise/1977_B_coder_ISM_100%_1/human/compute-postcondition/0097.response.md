The given code snippet appends the character `'1'` to the list `s`. This operation modifies the list `s` by adding an additional element to it.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `s` because of the `append` operation. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `flag` is not 0 if the if condition is met, either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0', `s` is modified based on the condition `(x & pow(2, i))` with an additional '1' appended, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the list `s` now has one more element `'1'` added to it, while all other variables retain their original values or conditions.
