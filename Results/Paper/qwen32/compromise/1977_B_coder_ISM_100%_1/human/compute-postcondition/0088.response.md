The code snippet appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `nalla`, `length`, and `flag`) remain unchanged. The condition `(x & pow(2, i))` is true, but since `i` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact impact on the state.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is ['1'], `flag` is not 0, and `(x & pow(2, i))` is true.**
