For the given task, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `nalla` is the loop variable and `t` determines how many times the loop will iterate. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), no adjustment is needed for `t` itself to ensure the loop executes at least once. However, we should specify the initial state of `nalla` before the loop starts.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- The loop variable `nalla` is initialized automatically by the `range(t)` function, starting from 0.
- Since `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should reflect that `t` is within the specified range and `nalla` is not yet initialized (as it will be by the `range` function).

State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `nalla` is not yet initialized**
