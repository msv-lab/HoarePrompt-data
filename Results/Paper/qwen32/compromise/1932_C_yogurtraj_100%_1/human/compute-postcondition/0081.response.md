The given code snippet only modifies the variable `q1` by decrementing it by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element updated to `k` and the `i`-th element updated to `k`, `ii` is the loop variable `i` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `ii - 2`, `q1` is decremented by 1, `q2` is incremented by 1 if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q1` is decremented by 1, and `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`. The `i`-th element of `y` is now `k`.**
