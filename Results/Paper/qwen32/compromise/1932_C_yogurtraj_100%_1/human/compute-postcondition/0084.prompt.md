Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `k` is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element updated to `k`, `ii` is the loop variable `ii` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y[i] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element updated to `k` and the `i`-th element updated to `k`, `ii` is the loop variable `ii` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `k` is the value used to update `y[i]`, `q1` and `q2` are as defined by the conditions in the problem statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element updated to `k` and the `i`-th element updated to `k`, `ii` is the loop variable `i` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `ii - 1`, `q2` is incremented by 1 if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q1` is decremented by 1, and `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`. The `i`-th element of `y` is now `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element updated to `k` and the `i`-th element updated to `k`, `ii` is the loop variable `i` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `ii - 2`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `q2` is incremented by 1 and `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`. Otherwise, `q1` is decremented by 1 and `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`. The `i`-th element of `y` is now `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
