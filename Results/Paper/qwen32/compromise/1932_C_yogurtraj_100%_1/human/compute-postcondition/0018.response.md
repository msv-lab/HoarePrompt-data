The code snippet `y[-1] = k` assigns the value of `k` to the last element of the list `y`. Since `y` is initially a list of `n` zeros, this operation changes only the last element of `y` to `k`.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the execution of the code:

- `t` remains a string (the input value).
- `n` remains the first integer read from input.
- `m` remains the second integer read from input.
- `a` remains a list of integers read from the input.
- `l` remains the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`.
- If the last character of `t` is 'L', `k` remains `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` remains `l - 2`, and `q2` remains `l`.
- Otherwise, `k` remains `a[l] % m`, `q1` remains `l - 1`, and `q2` remains `l + 1`.
- `y` is now a list of `n` zeros with the last element replaced by `k`.

Output State: **`t` is a string (the input value), `n` is the first integer read from input, `m` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `k` is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' else `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' else `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' else `l + 1`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element being `k`.**
