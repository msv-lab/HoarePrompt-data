Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t = input()
    l = t.count('L')
    k = 0
    q1 = 0
    q2 = 0
    if t[-1] == 'L':
        k = a[l - 1] % m
        q1 = l - 2
        q2 = l
    else:
        k = a[l] % m
        q1 = l - 1
        q2 = l + 1
    y = [0] * n
    y[-1] = k
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if t[i] == 'R':
            k = k * a[q2] % m
            q2 += 1
        else:
            k = k * a[q1] % m
            q1 -= 1
        y[i] = k
    print(*y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `t`: The input string, unchanged.
- `n`: The number of iterations the loop should run, unchanged.
- `m`: The modulus value, unchanged.
- `a`: The list of integers, unchanged.
- `l`: The number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, unchanged.
- `k`: The final value of `k` after the last iteration of the loop.
- `q1` and `q2`: The final values of `q1` and `q2` after the last iteration of the loop.
- `y`: The list `y` with `n` elements where each element from index `0` to `n-2` is the value of `k` calculated in each iteration, and the last element (index `n-1`) is the initial value of `k`.

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element from `n-2` to `0` has been updated to the corresponding value of `k` after all iterations, `ii` is the loop variable `i` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `k` is the final value after all iterations, `q1` and `q2` are adjusted based on the number of 'L's and 'R's encountered.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input string, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the value of `k` at each iteration of the loop, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `k` is the final value after the last iteration, `q1` and `q2` are adjusted based on the last character processed in the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
