Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input string, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is now `k`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `i` is 1, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, `q1` is unchanged, `q2` is `q2 + 1`**

In simple terms: The value of `q2` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
