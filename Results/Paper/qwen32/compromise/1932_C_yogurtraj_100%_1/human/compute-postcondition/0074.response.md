Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element updated to `k` and the `i`-th element updated to `k`, `ii` is the loop variable `i` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is `q1 - 1`, `q2` are as defined by the conditions in the problem statement, `i` is `ii - 1`**

In this output state, the only change is that the value of `q1` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
