You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():

    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Annotated Code:

    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in s.

    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10; s is a new input string consisting of the characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in s; ma is 0; mi is the position of the first 'B' in s; m is an input integer; c is the position of the first 'B' in s; d is 0; l is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10; s is a new input string consisting of the characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in s; ma is the position of the last 'B' in s; mi is the position of the first 'B' in s; m is an input integer; c is the position of the first 'B' in s; d is 0; l is an empty list.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the first 'B' in the string `s`, plus 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `m` and a string `s` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B'. It calculates and returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the first 'B' in the string `s`, plus 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white in order for all cells to become white. The program calculates the distance between the first and last black cell and adds 2 to it, which does not guarantee the minimum segment length that needs to be painted.

Let's consider a counterexample:
Input:
```
1
5
WBBBW
```
Expected Output:
```
3
```
Explanation:
In this case, the minimum segment to be painted white is "BBB", which is 3 cells long. The program, however, will calculate the distance between the first and last black cell (which is 1) and add 2, resulting in an output of 3. This specific example might seem to work, but let's consider another case:

Input:
```
1
5
BBBWW
```
Expected Output:
```
3
```
Explanation:
Here, the minimum segment to be painted white is "BBB", which is 3 cells long. However, the program will calculate the distance between the first and last black cell (which is 2) and add 2, resulting in an output of 4, which is incorrect.

The logic in the program does not correctly handle all cases, especially when there are multiple black cells grouped together. The correct approach would be to find the longest continuous segment of black cells, as painting that segment white will ensure all black cells are covered with the minimum segment length.
