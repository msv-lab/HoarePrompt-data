The code snippet assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Given that `i` is either 3 or 4, `num` will now hold the value of the element at index `i` in the list `ar`.

- If `i` is 3, `num` will be `ar[3]`.
- If `i` is 4, `num` will be `ar[4]`.

The other variables (`ar`, `same`, `minn`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers with at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `same` is either 1 or 2, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, and `n` is an input integer.**
