The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and since `i` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, it is now incremented by an additional 1. The length of `ar` being greater than `i` remains a valid condition after the code execution.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 2, `ar` has a length greater than `i`**.
