The code snippet provided is `same = 1`. This line simply reassigns the variable `same` to the value `1`. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `same` is updated to `1`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `num` is the element at index `i` of `ar`, `n` is an input integer, and the element at index `i` of `ar` is not equal to `num`.**
