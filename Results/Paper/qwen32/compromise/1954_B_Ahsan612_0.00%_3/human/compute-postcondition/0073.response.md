To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i = 1`
   - `same = 1`
   - `minn = inf`
   - `num = ar[0]`
   - `ar` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is an input integer (though `n` is not used in the loop).

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop continues until `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
   - If `ar[i] == num`, `same` is incremented.
   - If `ar[i] != num`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `num` is updated to `ar[i]`, and `same` is reset to 1.
   - `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will iterate through the entire list `ar` until `i` equals the length of `ar`.
   - During each iteration, it checks if the current element `ar[i]` is the same as the previous element (`num`). If yes, it increments `same`. If no, it updates `minn` and resets `same` to 1.
   - After the loop finishes, `minn` will hold the minimum count of consecutive equal elements encountered in the list.

4. **Final Output State:**
   - `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` because the loop continues until this condition is met.
   - `same` will be 1 if the last sequence of consecutive elements in `ar` has only one element, or it will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements if they are more than one.
   - `minn` will be the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found in the list.
   - `num` will be the last unique number encountered in the list.

Given the above logic, the final output state is:

Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements, `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found in the list, `num` is the last unique number encountered in the list.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be at the end of the list, `same` will reflect the count of the last sequence of consecutive numbers, `minn` will be the smallest sequence of consecutive numbers found in the list, and `num` will be the last unique number in the list.
