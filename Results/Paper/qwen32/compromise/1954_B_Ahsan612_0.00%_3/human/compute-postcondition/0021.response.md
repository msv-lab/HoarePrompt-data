Given the initial state and the code snippet, we will determine the output state after executing the code.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 2.
- `i` is 3.
- `num` is `ar[3]`.
- If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 and `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented to 2.

The code snippet is:
```
minn = min(minn, same)
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`.

Since `same` is either 1 or 2, and `minn` is initially either `inf` or 1:
- If `minn` was `inf`, it will be updated to `same` (which is either 1 or 2).
- If `minn` was 1, it will remain 1 because `min(1, 1)` is 1 and `min(1, 2)` is 1.

Therefore, the value of `minn` after the execution of the code will be 1 if it was initially 1, or it will be updated to `same` if it was `inf`.

Output State: **The input value `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 2; `i` is 3; `num` is `ar[3]`; If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 and `minn` is 2; Otherwise, `same` is 1 and `minn` is 1.**
