To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of the loop head variable `i` and potentially the length of the list `ar` to satisfy the condition `i < len(ar)`.

Given:
- `i` is currently 2.
- `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1.

The loop condition `i < len(ar)` must be true for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is 2, `len(ar)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **The input value `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 2. `i` is 2. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 and `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `minn` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented to 2.**
