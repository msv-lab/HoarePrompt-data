The code snippet `same += 1` increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `same` is either 1 or 2. If `same` was initially 1, it becomes 2. If `same` was initially 2, it becomes 3. The values of other variables (`n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input value `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 2. `i` is 2. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3 and `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `minn` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented to 2.**
