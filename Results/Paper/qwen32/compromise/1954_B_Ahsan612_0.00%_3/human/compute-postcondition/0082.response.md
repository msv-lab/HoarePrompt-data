The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of these elements to an integer, and then stores them in the list `ar`. This means that `ar` will now hold the new list of integers read from the input, and all other variables (`i`, `same`, `minn`, `num`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is 1 if the last sequence of consecutive elements in `ar` has only one element, or it is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements if they are more than one, `minn` is either `inf` or a finite value that is less than or equal to the current value of `same`, and `num` is the last unique number encountered in the list; `n` is an input integer.**
