The code snippet provided increments the value of `i` by 1. This means that the value of `i` will change from either 2 to 3 or from 3 to 4. However, since the precondition specifies that `i` is either 2 or 3, after the increment, `i` will be either 3 or 4 respectively. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers with at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `same` is either 1 or 3, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, `num` is either the first element of `ar`, the element at index `i` - 1 of `ar`, or `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `n` is an input integer.**
