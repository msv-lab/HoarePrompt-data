The code snippet assigns the value `inf` (positive infinity) to the variable `minn`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `ar`, `same`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input value must be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`.**
