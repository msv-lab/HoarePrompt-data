Postcondition: **The input value `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1. `i` is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 and `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `minn` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented to 2.**
