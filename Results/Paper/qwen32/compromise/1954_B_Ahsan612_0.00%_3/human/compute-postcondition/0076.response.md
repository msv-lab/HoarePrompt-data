The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the value `-1`. The initial state describes several variables (`i`, `same`, `minn`, `num`) and their relationships to the list `ar`, but the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it directly prints the integer `-1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variable Descriptions from Initial State:**
   - `i` is the length of the list `ar`.
   - `same` is either 1 if the last sequence of consecutive elements in `ar` has only one element, or it is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements if they are more than one.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf` (infinity).
   - `num` is the last unique number encountered in the list `ar`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The `print(-1)` statement does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state.
   - It directly outputs the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
