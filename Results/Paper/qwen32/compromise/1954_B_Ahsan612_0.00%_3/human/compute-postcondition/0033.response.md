To determine the final output state after the loop completes all iterations, let's analyze the given loop and the initial conditions:

- **Initial State:**
  - `n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 10^4).
  - `ar` is a list of integers.
  - `same` is 1.
  - `num` is the first element of `ar`.
  - `minn` is `inf`.
  - `i` is 1.

- **Loop Body:**
  - The loop iterates over the list `ar` starting from index 1.
  - If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is incremented by 1.
  - If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, `i` is incremented, `num` is updated to `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.
  - `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration.

- **Output States after Iterations:**
  - **After 1 iteration:** 
    - If `ar[1] == ar[0]`, then `same` becomes 2 and `minn` remains `inf`.
    - If `ar[1] != ar[0]`, then `same` becomes 1, `num` becomes `ar[1]`, `minn` becomes 1, and `i` becomes 2.
  - **After 2 iterations:**
    - The state depends on whether `ar[2]` is equal to `ar[1]` or not, and the previous states.
  - **After 3 iterations:**
    - The state depends on whether `ar[3]` is equal to `ar[2]` or not, and the previous states.

- **Final Output State:**
  - The loop will continue until `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
  - `same` will hold the count of consecutive elements equal to `num` at the end of the last sequence of equal elements.
  - `minn` will hold the minimum count of consecutive equal elements encountered during the entire iteration.
  - `num` will hold the last unique number encountered in the list.
  - `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` after the loop terminates.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations can be described as:

Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique number in `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of equal numbers, and `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive equal numbers encountered in `ar`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has finished iterating through the entire list `ar`.
- `i` now equals the length of the list `ar`.
- `num` is the last unique number encountered in the list.
- `same` is the count of how many times the last unique number appeared consecutively at the end of the list.
- `minn` is the smallest count of any sequence of consecutive equal numbers found in the list.
