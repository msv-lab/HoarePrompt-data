Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `ar` has a length greater than 1, `same` is 1 if `ar[i]` did not equal `num` initially, otherwise `same` is incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` did not equal `num`, `num` is set to `ar[2]` and `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the previous value of `same`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` is increased by 1. The other variables (`ar`, `same`, `num`, and `minn`) remain unchanged unless the subsequent conditions in the code are met, which are not part of the given snippet.
