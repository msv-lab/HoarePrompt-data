Postcondition: **`ar` is a list of integers with at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is either 2 or 3, `same` is either 1 or 3, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, `num` is either the first element of `ar`, the element at index `i` - 1 of `ar`, or `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `n` is an input integer. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, `same` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, `same` is set to 1, `minn` is set to 1, and `num` is updated to `ar[i]`.**
