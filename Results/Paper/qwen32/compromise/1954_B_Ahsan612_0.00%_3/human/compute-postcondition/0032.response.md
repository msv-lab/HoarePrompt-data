The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, so after the increment, `i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`.

The condition `len(ar) must be len(ar) + 1` is a contradiction and cannot be true in any practical scenario. Therefore, this condition does not affect the actual execution of the code but remains as part of the precondition description.

The other conditions related to `ar[i] == num` and the `IndexError` are also not directly impacted by the increment operation. They describe what happens if `i` is used as an index, but since `i` is now `len(ar) + 1`, any access to `ar[i]` would raise an `IndexError` as `i` is out of the bounds of the list `ar`.

The variable `same` is not affected by the increment operation.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`, `len(ar)` must be `len(ar) + 1`. If `ar[i] == num`, `same` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, an `IndexError` is raised and `same` is 1.**
