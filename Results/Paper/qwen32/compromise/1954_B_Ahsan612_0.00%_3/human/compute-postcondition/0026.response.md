The code snippet `same += 1` increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. The initial state mentions that `i` is equal to `len(ar)` and `len(ar)` must be `len(ar) + 1`, which seems to be a contradiction or a typo, as `len(ar)` cannot simultaneously be equal to itself and itself plus one. However, since the task is to update only the variables that have been changed by the code, we will focus on the variable `same`.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `len(ar)` must be `len(ar) + 1`, `same` is incremented by 1.**
