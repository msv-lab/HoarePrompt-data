The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `ar`. The initial state specifies that `n` is the input integer, which is the number of integers that will be provided in the input.

Output State: **The input value must be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer.**
