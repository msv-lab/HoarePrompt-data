The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` is either 3 or 4, after incrementing, `i` will be either 4 or 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ar` must have at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is either 4 or 5, `same` is either 1 or 3, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, `num` is either the first element of `ar`, the element at index `i` - 1 of `ar`, or `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`ar` must have at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is either 4 or 5, `same` is either 1 or 3, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, `num` is either the first element of `ar`, the element at index `i` - 1 of `ar`, or `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `n` is an input integer.**
