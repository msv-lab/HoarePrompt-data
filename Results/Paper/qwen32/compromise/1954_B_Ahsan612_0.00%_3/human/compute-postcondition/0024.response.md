The code snippet provided increments the variable `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, we need to consider the state of `i` before and after this operation. 

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 2.
- If `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3 and `minn` remains `inf`.
- If `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `minn` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented to 3.
- If `ar[3]` is equal to `num`, then `minn` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `minn` remains 1.

The code `i += 1` will increase the value of `i` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

**Output State Calculation:**
- `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `ar` remains a list of integers with length greater than 2.
- The values of `same`, `num`, and `minn` remain unchanged unless they were modified by conditions involving `ar[2]` and `ar[3]` before the code snippet.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State:** **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 2; if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3 and `minn` remains `inf`; if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1 or 2 depending on `ar[3]`, and `i` is 4; `i` is incremented by 1.**
