Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic Error in Counting Minimum Elements to Remove:**
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same (`minn`) and uses this to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. However, this approach is flawed.
   - The program only considers the minimum length of consecutive identical elements but does not account for the possibility of removing elements in a way that disrupts the "beautiful" condition more effectively.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing fewer elements than the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The program will determine that the minimum length of consecutive identical elements is 1, but the correct answer is 1, as removing any single element (e.g., the middle `1`) will make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Incorrect Output for Single Element Arrays:**
   - The program outputs `-1` for single-element arrays, which is incorrect. A single-element array is already non-beautiful by definition, so the correct output should be `0`.

4. **Incorrect Output for Arrays with All Elements Identical:**
   - The program outputs `-1` for arrays where all elements are identical, which is incorrect. As explained in the problem statement, an array with all identical elements cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so the correct output should be `-1`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program will output `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` as removing any single element (e.g., the middle `1`) will make the array non-beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one needs to identify the longest sequence of elements that can be made identical by the given operation and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to disrupt this sequence. This involves a more complex analysis of the array structure and cannot be solved simply by finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
