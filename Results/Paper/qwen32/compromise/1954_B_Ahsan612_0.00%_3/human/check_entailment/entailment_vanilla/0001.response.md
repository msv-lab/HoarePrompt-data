Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given a "beautiful" array where we can repeatedly choose an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a[i - 1] = a[i + 1]` and replace `a[i]` with `a[i - 1]` to make all elements the same.
- We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it stop being beautiful.
- If it's impossible to do so, we should output -1.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of the array, and `minn` to infinity.
   - It iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - If a segment of different numbers is found, it updates `minn` with the length of the previous segment and resets `same` and `num` for the new segment.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the length of the final segment.
   - If `minn` is still infinity (which means no segments were found, which is unlikely given the problem constraints), it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program aims to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.
- The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic of finding the minimum segment length is not sufficient to solve the problem.
- For example, in the case where the array is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], the minimum segment length is 1, but removing one element (e.g., the second 1) makes the array [1, 2, 2, 1], which is not beautiful. The program should correctly identify this and output 1.
- The program incorrectly outputs -1 for arrays where all elements are the same, which is incorrect because such arrays can be made non-beautiful by removing any element.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
