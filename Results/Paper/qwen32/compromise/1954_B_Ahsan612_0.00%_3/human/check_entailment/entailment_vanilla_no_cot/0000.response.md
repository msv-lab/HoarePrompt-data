Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the program is flawed because it only considers consecutive sequences of the same number and calculates the minimum length of such sequences. This does not account for the correct way to determine if the array can still be made beautiful after removing elements.

The program should check if there is a way to remove the minimum number of elements such that the remaining array is not beautiful. A more appropriate approach would involve checking if removing any element can result in an array where no more operations can make all elements the same.

Here's a more correct approach:

1. Identify segments of the array where the elements are the same.
2. Check if removing elements from any segment can result in an array that is not beautiful.
3. If the array consists of a single segment (all elements are the same), then it is impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, so the answer is -1.
4. Otherwise, find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the pattern.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # If the array has only one element, it is trivially beautiful and cannot be made not beautiful
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find segments of the same elements
        segments = []
        current_segment = [ar[0]]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ar[i] == ar[i - 1]:
                current_segment.append(ar[i])
            else:
                segments.append(current_segment)
                current_segment = [ar[i]]
        segments.append(current_segment)
        
        # If there is only one segment, it means all elements are the same
        if len(segments) == 1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # Find the minimum length of segments that can be removed
            min_removal = min(len(seg) for seg in segments)
            print(min_removal)

func()
```

This program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.
