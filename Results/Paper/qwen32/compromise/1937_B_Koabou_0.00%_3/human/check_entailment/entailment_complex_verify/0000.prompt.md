You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the grid. The next two lines each contain a binary string of length n, representing the binary values in the first and second row of the grid, respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: The list `a` contains two binary strings, one from each iteration of the loop. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

    #State: List `a` contains two binary strings, `t` is 3, `n` remains unchanged, `s` is `'1011'`, and `x` is `2`.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: 1011
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It then processes these inputs to derive a new binary string `s` and an integer `t`, which it prints. The string `s` is constructed based on specific conditions comparing the two input binary strings, and `t` is determined based on the prefix matching of the derived string `s` with the first input binary string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for finding the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Logic for Choosing the Path:**
   - The program attempts to find the point where it can switch from the top row to the bottom row to minimize the lexicographical order. However, it only considers the first occurrence where `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`. This is not sufficient to ensure that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest.
   - For example, consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     5
     01010
     00100
     ```
     The program might choose the path `00100` by switching at the first opportunity, but the lexicographically smallest path is actually `00010` by switching later.

2. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program attempts to count the number of paths that yield the smallest string, but the logic is flawed. It only considers the first path found and does not correctly account for all possible paths that yield the same smallest string.
   - For example, consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     3
     00
     00
     ```
     The program will output `000` and `2`, which is correct. However, if the grid is:
     ```
     1
     3
     01
     01
     ```
     The program might output `001` and `1`, but the correct answer should be `001` and `2` because there are two paths that yield the smallest string.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the smallest string is entirely in one row. For example:
     ```
     1
     3
     000
     111
     ```
     The program should output `000` and `1`, but it might not handle this correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
