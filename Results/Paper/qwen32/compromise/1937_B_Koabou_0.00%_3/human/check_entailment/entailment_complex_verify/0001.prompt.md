You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the grid. The next two lines each contain a binary string of length n, representing the binary values in the first and second row of the grid, respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    a = []
    n = int(input())

        a.append(input())
        
    #State: The list `a` contains two binary strings, one from each iteration of the loop. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]

    #State: List `a` contains two binary strings, `t` is 3, `n` remains unchanged, `s` is `'1011'`, and `x` is `2`.

    #This is printed: 1011
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It then processes these inputs to derive a new binary string `s` and an integer `t`, which it prints. The string `s` is constructed based on specific conditions comparing the two input binary strings, and `t` is determined based on the prefix matching of the derived string `s` with the first input binary string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a grasshopper that can move right or down on a 2xN grid filled with binary values. The goal is to find:
1. The lexicographically smallest string formed by the values on the path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.
2. The number of paths that yield this smallest string.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads the size of the grid (n) and the two rows of the grid as binary strings.
2. It then tries to find the lexicographically smallest string by determining the point where the grasshopper should switch from the first row to the second row (or vice versa) to achieve the smallest possible string.
3. It calculates the number of paths that yield this smallest string.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Identification of the Switch Point**: The program only checks if a switch should happen at a point where the first row has a '1' and the second row has a '0'. This is not sufficient to guarantee the lexicographically smallest string. It should consider all possible switch points and compare the resulting strings.
2. **Incorrect Path Count Calculation**: The number of paths yielding the smallest string is calculated incorrectly. The program assumes that the number of paths is the difference between the switch point and the first point where the prefix of the first row matches the prefix of the smallest string. This is not a correct way to count paths.
3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when the smallest string can be formed by staying in the first row or the second row entirely.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem. It does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest string and does not correctly count the number of paths that yield this smallest string.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
