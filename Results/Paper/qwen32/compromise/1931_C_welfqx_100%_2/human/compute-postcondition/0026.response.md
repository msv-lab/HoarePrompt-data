The code snippet provided is simply `ck = 1`, which assigns the value `1` to the variable `ck`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 0 if any `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` for any `j` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, otherwise `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, and the condition `n == 1 or f == 1` is true; `cn` is 1; `ck` is 1.**
