The code snippet provided is `cn += 1`, which increments the value of `cn` by 1. Given the initial state, `cn` is initially either 1 or 2. After the execution of the code, `cn` will be incremented by 1, making it either 2 or 3.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 5, `f` is 1, `num` is the new input list of integers, `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the last element of the input list, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`. `i` is 5. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `cn` is now either 2 or 3.**
