The code snippet provided increments the variable `ck` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, and `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. `ii` is `ii + 1`. `ck` is incremented by 1.**
