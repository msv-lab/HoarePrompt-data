The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n - 1`.

Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is not explicitly specified, but we know it must have been a value such that the loop condition `j < n - 1` was true. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.
