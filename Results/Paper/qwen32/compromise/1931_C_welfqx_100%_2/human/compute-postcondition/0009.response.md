Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is not specified before the loop starts. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, then `f` is set to 0 and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `f` remains 1.**
