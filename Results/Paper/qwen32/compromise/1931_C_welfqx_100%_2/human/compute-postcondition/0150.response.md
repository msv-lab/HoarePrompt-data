The given code snippet is `onum = num.copy()`. This line creates a copy of the list `num` and assigns it to `onum`. No other variables are modified by this line, and the other conditions and values remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `f` is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, otherwise `f` is 1, `num` is the new input list of integers, `onum` is a copy of the input list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the first element of the input list, `ck` depends on the conditions provided for `symb1` and `symb2`, and `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`. If `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, then the conditions specified for `f`, `num`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`, and `r` are maintained as described.**
