The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those for the loop to execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `n` must be at least 2.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, and `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, we need to adjust `n` to ensure the loop can execute. The other variables (`t`, `f`, and `num`) do not affect the execution of the loop directly.

To ensure the loop executes:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `j` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts; it will be initialized by the `range` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is not specified before the loop starts**
