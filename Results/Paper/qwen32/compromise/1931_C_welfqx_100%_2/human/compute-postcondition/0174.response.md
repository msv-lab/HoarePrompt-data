Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer and must be at least 2; `f` is 1; `num` is the new input list of integers; `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`; `symb1` is the first element of the input list; `symb2` is the last element of the input list; `ck` is 2; `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`; `cn` is `n`. Additionally, `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `ck` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
