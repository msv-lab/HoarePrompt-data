Let's analyze the given code and the initial state step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the input integer.
- `f` is initialized to 1.
- `num` is the input list of integers.
- `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`.
- `symb1` is the first element of the input list `num`.
- `symb2` is the last element of the input list `num`.
- `cn` is calculated as `n + ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`; otherwise, `cn` remains `n`.
- `r` is incremented by 1 if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not being equal to `num[j + 1]`.
- `ii` is the index where the loop broke or `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations.
- `ck` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of `num`.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print(n - max(cn, ck))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `symb1` and `symb2`:**
   - `symb1` is the first element of `num`, i.e., `num[0]`.
   - `symb2` is the last element of `num`, i.e., `num[n-1]`.

2. **Determine `cn`:**
   - If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn = n + ck`.
   - Otherwise, `cn = n`.

3. **Determine `ck`:**
   - `ck` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of `num`.
   - This is calculated by iterating from the end of the list and counting how many elements are the same as the last element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached.

4. **Determine `max(cn, ck)`:**
   - This will be the maximum value between `cn` and `ck`.

5. **Determine the final output:**
   - The final output is `n - max(cn, ck)`.

### Final Output Description:
- The output depends on the values of `cn` and `ck`.
- If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is `n + ck`; otherwise, `cn` is `n`.
- `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of `num`.
- The final printed value is `n` minus the maximum of `cn` and `ck`.

### Output:
Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where cn is n + ck if symb1 equals symb2, otherwise cn is n, and ck is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of num)**
