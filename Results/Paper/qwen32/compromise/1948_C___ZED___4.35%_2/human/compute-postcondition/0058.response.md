The code snippet sets `no_path` to `False`. This change affects the variable `no_path`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than `i + 3`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `no_path` is `False`, and `k` is `i + 3`.**
