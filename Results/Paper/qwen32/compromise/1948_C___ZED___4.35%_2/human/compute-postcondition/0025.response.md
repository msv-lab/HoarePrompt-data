To determine what will be printed when the `print(k)` statement is executed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. **`n`**: An integer that is at least 3.
3. **`a`**: A string.
4. **`b`**: A string with the second-to-last character '>'.
5. **`no_path`**: A boolean value that is `True`.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet attempts to print the variable `k`. However, the initial state provided does not mention any variable named `k`. Therefore, based on the given information, it is impossible to determine the value of `k` as it is not defined in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
Since `k` is not defined in the initial state, the code will raise a `NameError` because it tries to print a variable that does not exist.

### Output:
Output: **NameError: name 'k' is not defined**
