Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is the user's input.
- `b` is the user's input.
- `i` is `i + 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet consists of a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **YES**
