The task provides an initial state and a Python code snippet containing a `print` statement. The goal is to determine exactly what will be printed when the statement executes based on the given initial state.

In this specific case:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer.
- `a` and `b` are user inputs, but their specific values are not provided.
- `i` is `i + 2` (unchanged), which means `i` is not used in the `print` statement and its value does not affect the output.
- `no_path` is `False`, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, the value of `'NO'` is not dependent on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, or `no_path`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **NO**
