Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` and `b` are the input strings, `i` is `i + 1`. If `no_path` was initially `False` and any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to the largest odd number less than `n-1`) is not `'>'`, then `no_path` remains `False`. Otherwise, `no_path` becomes `True`. If `no_path` was initially `True`, it remains `True`.**
