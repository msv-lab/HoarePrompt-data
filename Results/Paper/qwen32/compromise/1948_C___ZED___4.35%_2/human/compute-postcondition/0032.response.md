Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer that is at least 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string with the second-to-last character '>', `k` is the value of `k` from the previous iteration plus 2, and `no_path` is False if `a[k]` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` remains unchanged.**
