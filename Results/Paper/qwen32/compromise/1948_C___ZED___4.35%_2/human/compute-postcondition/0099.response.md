The only variables in the loop head are `k`, `n`, and the range parameters. Since `n` is given and does not change, and `t` and `a` and `b` are not in the loop head, we only need to adjust `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was used to index into `b` and check if `b[k]` is not equal to '>'. Since the loop increments `k` by 2 in each iteration, for the next iteration to execute, `k` must be increased by 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than `n`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be `k + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the user's input, `b` is the user's input. If the current value of `b[k]` is not equal to '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True, `k` is `k + 2`**
