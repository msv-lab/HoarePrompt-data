Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles and then form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. The key points are:
- If `a` or `b` is even, it is possible to form another rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it is not possible to form another rectangle.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
3. It checks the following conditions:
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints "yes".
   - If `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`, it prints "no".
   - If `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`, it prints "yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "no".

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`**:
   - This condition is syntactically incorrect and does not make logical sense. It seems to be an attempt to compare values but is likely a mistake.
2. **Condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`**:
   - This condition is always true for any non-zero `a - b`, which is incorrect. The condition does not correctly determine the possibility of forming a new rectangle.
3. **Handling of Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where one dimension is even and the other is odd. It should print "yes" in such cases.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach is to check if either `a` or `b` is even. If either dimension is even, it is possible to form another rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, it is not possible.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Evaluation:
Let's evaluate the original program using the function summary and the corrected approach.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary states that the program prints 'yes' or 'no' based on the parity of `a` and `b`. However, the logic in the program is flawed, as explained above.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The original program does not correctly handle all cases. It incorrectly checks conditions and does not properly determine if a new rectangle can be formed.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - For the input `2 3`, the original program might print "no", but it should print "yes" because `2` is even.
   - For the input `3 2`, the original program might print "no", but it should print "yes" because `2` is even.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program is incorrect due to flawed logic and incorrect handling of conditions.

Final: **False**
