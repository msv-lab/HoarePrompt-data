### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem states that Bob can form another rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange those to form a new one. The key observation is that this is possible if and only if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle is even. This is because if both dimensions are odd, the resulting smaller rectangles will have dimensions that are 1 (odd) by some other odd number, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Let's break down the logic in the provided code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Decision Logic:**
   - The first condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`). If so, it prints 'yes'. This condition is correct because if both dimensions are even, Bob can always form another rectangle.
   - The second condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the problem. It seems to be an attempt to check if `a` and `b` are the same, but the syntax is wrong and does not achieve the intended result.
   - The third condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is also incorrect. It will always evaluate to `True` for any non-zero `a` and `b` because the difference between two numbers can never be exactly `0` when using the `>` or `<` operators. This condition does not correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle.
   - The `else` condition prints 'no', which is correct only if the first condition is not met and the second and third conditions are incorrect.

### Correct Logic:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, print 'yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'no'.

### Correct Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

#State: t remains unchanged, a and b hold the values from the last test case.
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
