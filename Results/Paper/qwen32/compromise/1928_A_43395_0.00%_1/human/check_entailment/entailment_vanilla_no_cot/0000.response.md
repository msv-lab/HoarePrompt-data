Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob can form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

- If the original rectangle is `a x b`, he can cut it into two rectangles of dimensions `(a/2) x b` and `(a/2) x b` if `a` is even, or `a x (b/2)` and `a x (b/2)` if `b` is even.
- To form a new rectangle, at least one of the dimensions `a` or `b` must be even. If both are odd, he can't form a new rectangle because the two smaller rectangles will always be `1 x b` or `a x 1`, and reassembling them will just give back the original `a x b` rectangle.

### Program Analysis:
Let's go through the logic in the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   for i in range(int(input())):
       (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and the dimensions of each rectangle.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   ```python
   if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If they are, it prints 'yes', which is correct because in this case, he can form a new rectangle.

3. **Incorrect Conditions:**
   ```python
   elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
       print('no')
   ```
   This condition is incorrect. The logic `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is not valid for checking if the rectangle can't be rearranged into a new one. It seems to be a mistake in the logic.

4. **Another Incorrect Condition:**
   ```python
   elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This condition is also incorrect. Checking `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` will always be true because the difference of two integers is never zero unless `a == b`. Even if `a == b`, the condition is not the correct way to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.

5. **Default Case:**
   ```python
   else:
       print('no')
   ```
   This part is intended to cover the case where the rectangle cannot be rearranged into a new one. However, due to the incorrect conditions above, this part might not work as intended.

### Correct Logic:
The correct logic should be:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, print 'yes'.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, print 'no'.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed conditions used to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **False**
