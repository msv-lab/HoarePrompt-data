The code snippet initializes a list `nums` with `n` zeros. This means that after the execution of the code, `nums` will be a list of length `n` where each element is `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `nums` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `0`.**
