### Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem by constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` while maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

Let's break down the provided function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums = [0] * n`: Initializes a list of `n` zeros.
   - `nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`: Sets the first element of `nums` to the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but all bits set to 1. This is not necessarily the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, but rather the largest number that has the same number of bits as `k` in its binary representation, with all bits set to 1. For example, if `k` is 5 (binary `101`), `nums[0]` will be 3 (binary `11`).
   - `k -= nums[0]`: Decreases `k` by the value of `nums[0]`.

2. **Filling the List**:
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `nums[i]` is set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. This ensures that no element in the list exceeds `nums[0] + 1` and that the sum of the list remains `k`.
   - `k -= nums[i]`: Decreases `k` by the value of `nums[i]`.

3. **Final Adjustment**:
   - `nums[0] += k`: Adds any remaining value of `k` to the first element of `nums`.

### Analysis:

The approach taken by the function is not optimal for maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. The goal should be to distribute the value of `k` in such a way that the bitwise OR of the numbers has the maximum number of 1s.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 5`. The function will set `nums[0]` to 3 (binary `11`), and `nums[1]` to 2 (binary `10`), resulting in a bitwise OR of `11 | 10 = 11` (binary `11`), which has 2 ones. However, a better solution would be to set `nums[0]` to 1 (binary `01`) and `nums[1]` to 4 (binary `100`), resulting in a bitwise OR of `01 | 100 = 101` (binary `101`), which has 3 ones.

### Conclusion:

The given function does not guarantee that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
