You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the list to be returned and `k` is a non-negative integer. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, and the remaining elements are filled with the remaining value of `k` distributed such that no element exceeds the value of the first element plus one. After distributing `k`, any remaining value is added to `nums[0]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all these integers.

### Key Points:
1. **Sum Constraint**: The sum of the sequence must be exactly `k`.
2. **Bitwise OR Maximization**: The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence should be maximized.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using the following logic:
1. It first calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and subtracts 1 from it to get the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation. This value is assigned to the first element of the sequence.
2. It then distributes the remaining sum (`k - nums[0]`) among the remaining elements of the sequence.
3. The function `func_1` is supposed to return a sequence that satisfies the conditions.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initial Value Calculation**:
   - The initial value assigned to `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but with all bits set to 1. However, this value might not always be the best choice to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - For example, if `k` is a power of 2, the initial value assigned to `nums[0]` would be `k - 1`, which might not be optimal.

2. **Distribution of Remaining Sum**:
   - The program distributes the remaining sum among the remaining elements, but it does not always ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s.
   - The strategy of adding the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` or `k` to the next elements might not be optimal for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, we should aim to use numbers that have as many 1s in their binary representation as possible. One effective strategy is to use powers of 2 and distribute the remaining sum among the least significant bits.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not guarantee that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s, hence it is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
