### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Program Logic:**
   - The program counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string.
   - It then calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.
   - This value is returned as the penalty.

2. **Problem Requirements:**
   - The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

3. **Analysis of the Program:**
   - The provided program does not attempt to split the array into subarrays.
   - It only counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns the absolute difference, which does not align with the logic required to minimize the penalty.

4. **Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     ```
     1
     4
     ++--
     ```
     - Expected Output: 0
     - Program Output: 0
     - The program correctly outputs 0 because the number of '+' and '-' characters are equal, and any split will result in a penalty of 0.
   
   - **Test Case 2:**
     ```
     1
     5
     +----+
     ```
     - Expected Output: 2
     - Program Output: 1
     - The program incorrectly outputs 1. The optimal split should result in a penalty of 2, not 1. For example, splitting the array into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [-1, 1])` results in a penalty of `0 + 2 = 2`.

   - **Test Case 3:**
     ```
     1
     6
     +-+-+-
     ```
     - Expected Output: 0
     - Program Output: 0
     - The program correctly outputs 0 because the number of '+' and '-' characters are equal, and any split will result in a penalty of 0.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not implement the logic to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
   - The program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
