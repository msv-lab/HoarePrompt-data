Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to split a given string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by the length of the subarray.

### Key Points
1. **String to Array Conversion**: Each `+` in the string contributes `1` to the array, and each `-` contributes `-1`.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: For a subarray `c` of length `m`, the penalty is `|sum(c)| * m`.
3. **Optimal Splitting**: We need to find the way to split the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.

### Strategy
To minimize the penalty, we should try to create subarrays where the sum is zero because the penalty for such subarrays is zero. If we can't create subarrays with a sum of zero, we should aim for subarrays with the smallest possible absolute sum.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program does the following:
1. It counts the number of `+` in the string.
2. It calculates the number of `-` by subtracting the count of `+` from the total length of the string.
3. It returns the absolute difference between the count of `+` and `-`.

#### Issues in the Provided Program
- The program does not consider splitting the string into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
- It simply calculates the difference between the counts of `+` and `-` and returns the absolute value of this difference, which does not solve the problem as described.

### Correctness
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It does not implement the logic to split the string into subarrays and calculate the penalties optimally.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
