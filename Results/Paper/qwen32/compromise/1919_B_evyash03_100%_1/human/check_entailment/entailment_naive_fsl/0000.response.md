Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns the absolute difference between these counts, which does not align with the logic required to minimize the penalty.

Let's consider a few cases to illustrate the issue:

1. **Test Case:**
   ```
   1
   4
   ++--
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** 0
   - **Explanation:** The string `++--` can be split into `([1, 1], [-1, -1])` or `([1], [1], [-1], [-1])` both of which result in a penalty of 0.
   - **Program Output:** 0
   - **Explanation:** The program counts 2 '+' and 2 '-', and returns `abs(2 - 2) = 0`, which is correct for this case.

2. **Test Case:**
   ```
   1
   5
   +----+
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** 4
   - **Explanation:** The string `+----+` can be split into `([1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [1])` resulting in a penalty of `1 + 4 + 1 = 6`. However, the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [-1, 1])` which results in a penalty of `0 + 2 = 2`. But the optimal split is actually `([1, -1], [1, -1], [-1, 1])` which results in a penalty of `0 + 0 + 2 = 2`. However, the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1])` which results in a penalty of `0 + 4 = 4`.
   - **Program Output:** 4
   - **Explanation:** The program counts 2 '+' and 3 '-', and returns `abs(2 - 3) = 1`, which is incorrect.

3. **Test Case:**
   ```
   1
   6
   +-+-+-
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** 0
   - **Explanation:** The string `+-+-+-` can be split into `([1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1])` resulting in a penalty of `0`.
   - **Program Output:** 0
   - **Explanation:** The program counts 3 '+' and 3 '-', and returns `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which is correct for this case.

From the above examples, it is clear that the program does not always produce the correct minimum penalty. Specifically, it does not implement the logic to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Incorrect Case:**
```
1
5
+----+
```
- **Expected Output:** 2
- **Program Output:** 1

The program does not handle the optimal splitting logic correctly, hence it is incorrect.
