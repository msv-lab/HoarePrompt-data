You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the following t lines, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: For each of the initial t lines, the output will be the integer x from that line minus 1. The value of t remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each of the following `t` lines, it reads an integer `x` and prints `x - 1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program always outputs `y = x - 1` for each test case. While `y = x - 1` can be a valid choice in some cases, it does not guarantee that the sum `\gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized for all possible values of `x`.

Let's consider an example:

For `x = 7`, the program outputs `y = 6`. The sum is `\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7`.

However, if we try `y = 3`, the sum is `\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4`, which is not better than 7 in this case, but let's consider another example:

For `x = 10`, the program outputs `y = 9`. The sum is `\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10`.

But if we try `y = 5`, the sum is `\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10`, which is the same as the program's output but let's consider another example to show that the program is not always correct:

For `x = 21`, the program outputs `y = 20`. The sum is `\gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21`.

But if we try `y = 18`, the sum is `\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21`, which is the same as the program's output but let's consider another example:

For `x = 100`, the program outputs `y = 99`. The sum is `\gcd(100, 99) + 99 = 1 + 99 = 100`.

But if we try `y = 98`, the sum is `\gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 2 + 98 = 100`, which is the same as the program's output but let's consider another example:

For `x = 6`, the program outputs `y = 5`. The sum is `\gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6`.

But if we try `y = 3`, the sum is `\gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6`, which is the same as the program's output but let's consider another example:

For `x = 1000`, the program outputs `y = 999`. The sum is `\gcd(1000, 999) + 999 = 1 + 999 = 1000`.

But if we try `y = 750`, the sum is `\gcd(1000, 750) + 750 = 250 + 750 = 1000`, which is the same as the program's output.

While the program sometimes outputs a correct `y`, it does not guarantee that the sum `\gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized for all possible values of `x`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
