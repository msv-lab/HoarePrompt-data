Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `counter` is set to 1 or 2 if the current element `num[i]` is equal to `'0'`, otherwise `counter` remains 0, `i` is decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `num`, `counter`, and `i` remain as they were before the `break` statement. The only change is that the program execution will exit the current loop or if statement.
