### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to determine the winner of the game based on the provided rules and inputs. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Function `func_1` Misinterpretation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to count the trailing zeros in a number, but it always returns 0. This is because the loop breaks as soon as it encounters a non-zero digit, and the counter is not correctly incremented for trailing zeros.
   - Given the current implementation, the list `zeros` will always be filled with zeros, which will not affect the final logic of the program.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The program calculates `total_digits` as the sum of the lengths of all numbers in the list.
   - It then calculates `subtract_zero` by summing every other element from the sorted `zeros` list (which, as mentioned, contains only zeros).
   - The final condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is used to determine the winner. Given that `subtract_zero` is always 0, this simplifies to `total_digits >= m + 1`.
   - This logic does not correctly account for the optimal play by Anna and Sasha. It does not consider the strategic choices made by the players, such as Anna reversing digits to minimize the final number and Sasha concatenating numbers to maximize it.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The optimal strategy for Anna is to reverse digits in such a way that the final number is minimized.
   - The optimal strategy for Sasha is to concatenate numbers in such a way that the final number is maximized.
   - The current program does not simulate these strategies and instead relies on a simplified condition that does not reflect the game dynamics.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play of both players. It simplifies the problem in a way that does not align with the game rules and strategic decisions.

**Correctness: False**
