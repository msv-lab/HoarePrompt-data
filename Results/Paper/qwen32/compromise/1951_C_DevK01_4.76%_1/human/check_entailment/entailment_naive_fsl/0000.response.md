Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue is that it incorrectly calculates the cost of buying tickets based on a greedy approach that does not account for the optimal way to distribute the ticket purchases over the days to minimize the total cost.

Here is a specific counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
12
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at a cost of 1*2 = 2. Prices become [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
- Day 2: Buy 2 tickets at a cost of 3*2 = 6. Prices become [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
- Day 3: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 5*1 = 5.

Total cost = 2 + 6 + 5 = 13.

However, the optimal way is:
- Day 1: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 1*1 = 1. Prices become [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
- Day 2: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 2*1 = 2. Prices become [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
- Day 3: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 3*1 = 3. Prices become [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
- Day 4: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 4*1 = 4. Prices become [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
- Day 5: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 5*1 = 5.

Total cost = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.

But the optimal way is actually:
- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at a cost of 1*2 = 2. Prices become [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
- Day 2: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 3*1 = 3. Prices become [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
- Day 3: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 4*1 = 4. Prices become [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
- Day 4: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 5*1 = 5.

Total cost = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14.

The program provided does not consider this optimal distribution of ticket purchases, and therefore it does not always yield the minimum cost. Hence, the program is incorrect.
