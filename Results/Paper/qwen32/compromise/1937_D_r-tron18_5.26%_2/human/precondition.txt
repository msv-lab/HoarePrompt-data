arr is a list of strings where each string consists of characters '<' and '>', and times is a list of integers representing the lengths of the corresponding strings in arr, with each integer n satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5. The length of arr and times is the same and represents the number of test cases t, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
