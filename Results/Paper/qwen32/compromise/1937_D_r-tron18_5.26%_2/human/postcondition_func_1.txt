The function `func_2` processes a string `s1` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, along with its length `n`, to compute and print a list `ans` of integers. The list `ans` is derived based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1` and specific calculations involving cumulative sums and indices.
