The code snippet assigns values from the list `r` to the variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The initial state provides the constraints and conditions for these variables, which remain valid except for the specific values assigned by the code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `h` and `w` are positive integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w; it is guaranteed that x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b; the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `r` is a list of integers read from input; `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`.**
