The code snippet assigns the value of `m` to `y1`. This changes the value of `y1` from its initial value to `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - m)`, `h` and `w` are positive integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w; it is guaranteed that x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b; the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `r` is a list of integers read from input; `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `m`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`; `x2` is greater than `x1`; and (x2 - x1) is even; `y1` is not equal to `y2`. Additionally, `y1` is greater than `y2`. If `y1` is greater than `y2`, then `a` is set to `m - y1`. `b` is `x2 - x1`. `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**
