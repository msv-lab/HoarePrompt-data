Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. `n` represents the size of a square grid, and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals that should contain at least one colored cell. For each test case, the function returns a result indicating whether it is possible to color the grid such that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell.**
