Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has finished executing, the `cntl` list will contain the frequency of each integer from 0 to `n` as it appears in the list `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` retains its original list of integers.
