To determine what will be printed by the `print(j)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`cntl` is a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.**
   - This means `cntl[0]` is the count of `0` in `a`, `cntl[1]` is the count of `1` in `a`, and so on.

2. **The count of the integer `0` in the list `a` (i.e., `cntl[0]`) is greater than 0.**
   - This tells us that there is at least one `0` in the list `a`.

3. **`c` is either `1` or `0`.**
   - The value of `c` can be either `1` or `0`.

4. **`n` must be greater than 0.**
   - `n` is a positive integer.

5. **The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.**
   - This means the count of the integer `j` in the list `a` is either `0` or `1`.

6. **The current value of `c` is `0` or `j` is equal to `n`.**
   - This condition provides two possibilities:
     - `c` is `0`, or
     - `j` is equal to `n`.

Given the above conditions, let's determine the value of `j` that will be printed:

- Since `cntl[j] < 2`, `j` can be any integer that appears in `a` at most once.
- The condition `c` is `0` or `j` is equal to `n` gives us two scenarios:
  - If `c` is `0`, `j` can be any integer that satisfies `cntl[j] < 2`.
  - If `j` is equal to `n`, it must also satisfy `cntl[n] < 2`.

Since `n` is a positive integer and `cntl[n] < 2`, `j` could be `n` if `c` is not `0`. However, if `c` is `0`, `j` can be any integer that appears in `a` at most once.

Without specific values for `c` and the exact contents of `a`, we can't pinpoint a single value for `j`. However, based on the conditions, `j` must be a value that satisfies `cntl[j] < 2` and either `c` is `0` or `j` is `n`.

Given the constraints, the most precise description we can provide is that `j` is a value that meets the conditions specified.

Output: **j (where j is a value such that cntl[j] < 2 and either c is 0 or j is equal to n)**
