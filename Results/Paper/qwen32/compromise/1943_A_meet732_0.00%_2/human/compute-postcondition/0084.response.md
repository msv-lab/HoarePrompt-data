To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates over each integer in the list `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `cntl` list by 1. This means that by the end of the loop, `cntl[i]` will hold the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `n` is an input integer.

After all iterations of the loop, the `cntl` list will reflect the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. Specifically, `cntl[i]` will be the number of times the integer `i` appears in `a`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`, `n` is an input integer.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `cntl` will contain the frequency count of each integer from 0 to `n` as it appears in the list `a`.
