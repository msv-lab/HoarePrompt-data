Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`; `n` is at least 1; `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `j` is `j + 1`. If `cntl[j] < 2`, then `c` is decremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `not c` or `j == n`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `c`, and the most internal loop or if statement continues if `cntl[j] >= 2`.**
