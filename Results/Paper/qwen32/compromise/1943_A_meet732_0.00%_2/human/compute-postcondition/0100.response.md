Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`; `n` is at least 1; `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `cntl`, `n`, and `cntl[0]` remain unchanged. The variable `j` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited due to the `break` statement.
