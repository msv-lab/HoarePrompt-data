Postcondition: **`cntl` is a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. The count of the integer `0` in the list `a` (i.e., `cntl[0]`) is greater than 0; `c` is either `0` or `-1`; `n` must be greater than 0; `j` is 2. If `c` is `0` or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
