Postcondition: **`cntl` is a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program does nothing specific regarding `cntl[0]` in the if part. Otherwise, the loop prints the smallest `j` for which `cntl[j] < 2` or `j` reaches `n`.**
