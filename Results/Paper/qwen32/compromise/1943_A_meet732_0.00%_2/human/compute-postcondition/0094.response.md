Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`, `n` must be at least 1, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is 1, the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and either `c` is false or `j` equals `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
