Postcondition: **`cntl` is a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. The count of the integer `0` in the list `a` (i.e., `cntl[0]`) is greater than 0; `c` is either `1` or `0`; `n` must be greater than 0. Additionally, the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2. The current value of `c` is `0` or `j` is equal to `n`.**
