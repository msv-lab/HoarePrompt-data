Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                c -= 1
                if not c or j == n:
                    print(j)
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, no specific changes are made to `cntl` or other variables in this block. Otherwise, the smallest `j` such that `cntl[j] < 2` is found after decrementing `cntl` values to 0, or `n` if no such `j` is found within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cntl` is a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program does nothing specific regarding `cntl[0]` in the if part. Otherwise, the loop prints the smallest `j` for which `cntl[j] < 2` or `j` reaches `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`, and `n` is an input integer. If `cntl[0]` is equal to 0, the program continues without further action. Otherwise, the loop prints the first `j` (from 1 to `n`) for which `cntl[j]` becomes 0 or when `j` reaches `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
