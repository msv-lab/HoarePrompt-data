Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`; `n` is at least 1; `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `j` is `j + 1`; the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `cntl[j] < 2` or `not c` or `j == n`; `c` is decremented by 1. If `not c` or `j == n`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
