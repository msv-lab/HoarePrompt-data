The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `cntl`, `c`, `n`, or `j`. It only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cntl` is a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is greater than 0, `c` is either `-1` or `-2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
