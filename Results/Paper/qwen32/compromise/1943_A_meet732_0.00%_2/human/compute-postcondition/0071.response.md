Postcondition: **`cntl` is a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 3. If `cntl[3]` is less than 2, then `c` is either `-1` or `-2`. If `c` is `0` or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
