You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

    #State: After all iterations, the program will have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, it will have read an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using the list `cntl`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, it prints 0. Otherwise, it finds and prints the smallest integer `j` (from 1 to `n`) such that `cntl[j]` is less than 2, or `n` if no such `j` is found.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`. It then determines and prints the smallest integer `j` (from 1 to `n`) such that the count of `j` in the list `a` is less than 2, or `n` if no such `j` exists. If the count of 0 in the list `a` is 0, it prints 0 immediately.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Objective**: Determine the final score (MEX) of array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` (only Alice does this) or removing elements from `a` (both do this).
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.
3. **MEX Definition**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

### Program Analysis

The program uses the following approach:

1. **Input Reading**: For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: It counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using `cntl`.
3. **Game Strategy**:
   - If `0` does not appear in `a`, the MEX is `0` (because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the initial `c` based on the count of `0`s in `a` (capped at `2`).
   - It then iterates through the possible values from `1` to `n`, decrementing `c` whenever a number appears less than twice.
   - When `c` reaches `0` or the loop ends, it prints the current number `j` as the MEX.

### Correctness Analysis

Let's verify the logic:

1. **Handling `0`**:
   - If `0` is not in `a`, the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer not present.
   - This part is correctly handled by the program.

2. **Handling Other Numbers**:
   - The program aims to ensure that as many numbers as possible (up to `2` occurrences) are included in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - It iterates through the numbers from `1` to `n` and checks their counts.
   - If a number appears less than twice, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` reaches `0` or the loop ends.

### Potential Issues

- The logic seems correct, but let's consider edge cases:
  - **Single Element**: If `a` contains only one element, the MEX should be `1` if the element is `0`, and `0` otherwise.
  - **All Elements Same**: If all elements are the same, the MEX should be the next integer after the repeated number.
  - **All Elements Distinct**: If all elements are distinct, the MEX should be `n` (the next integer after the largest element).

### Conclusion

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It handles various edge cases correctly.
