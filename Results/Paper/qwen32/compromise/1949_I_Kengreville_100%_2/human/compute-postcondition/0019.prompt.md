You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for each i from 0 to n-1. visited and coef are lists of size n initialized to False and None respectively.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `x` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `y` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `r` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `visited` is a list of size `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `x` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `y` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `r` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `visited` is a list of size `n` with all elements `True`, `coef` is a list of size `n` with the first element of each connected component set to `1` and others `None` or `1` depending on the `dfs(i)` function, `tot` is the sum of values from the last connected component processed, `bipartite` is `True` if all connected components are bipartite, otherwise `False`, `ok` is `True` if at least one connected component is bipartite and its `tot` is not zero.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `x` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `y` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `r` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `visited` is a list of size `n` with all elements `True`, `coef` is a list of size `n` with the first element of each connected component set to `1` and others `None` or `1` depending on the `dfs(i)` function, `tot` is the sum of values from the last connected component processed, `bipartite` is `True` if all connected components are bipartite, otherwise `False`. If `ok` is `True`, it indicates that at least one connected component is bipartite and its `tot` is not zero. If `ok` is `False`, it indicates that no connected component is bipartite or the `tot` of all bipartite components is zero.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. It operates based on predefined global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`. The function returns no explicit value (None). It likely performs some operation involving the disks defined by their centers (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`), possibly marking disks as visited (`visited`) and calculating or storing coefficients (`coef`).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
