The code snippet `r = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `r` to be a new list of size `n` with all elements set to `None`. This overwrites the previous list `r` which contained integers representing the radii of disks.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `x` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `y` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `r` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `visited` is a list of size `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of size `n` initialized to `None`.**
