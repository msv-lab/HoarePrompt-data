To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `mak`: This variable holds the highest index `i` for which the input was `'>'`. If no input was `'>'`, it defaults to `0`.
- `mak2`: This variable is explicitly set to `0`.
- `pans`: This variable is mentioned as "unchanged," but no specific details about its content are provided. We need to assume that `pans` is a list or array-like structure since we are accessing it with an index (`pans[mak]`).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`mak2`**: According to the initial state, `mak2` is explicitly set to `0`. Therefore, this part of the print statement will output `0`.

2. **`pans[mak]`**: 
   - `mak` is the highest index where the input was `'>'` or `0` if no such input exists.
   - Since we don't have the specific contents of `pans`, we can only describe the output in terms of `mak` and `pans`.
   - The value of `pans[mak]` depends on the value of `mak` and the content of `pans` at that index.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, we know `mak2` is `0`. However, without knowing the specific contents of `pans` and the exact value of `mak`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **! 0 pans[mak] (where mak is the highest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no input was '>', and pans is the list or array-like structure being accessed)**
