The code snippet `pans = [i]` creates a list named `pans` containing the current value of `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `s`, and `mak` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `s` is the new input string; `i` is incremented by 1; `mak` is equal to the new value of `i`; `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`.**
