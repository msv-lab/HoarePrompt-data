Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `s` is the new input string; `i` is incremented by 1; `mak` is equal to the incremented `i`.**

Natural Language: The value of `mak` is now set to the value of `i` after `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
