Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`. The current input is `'<'`, so `mak2` is updated to the current index `i`.**
