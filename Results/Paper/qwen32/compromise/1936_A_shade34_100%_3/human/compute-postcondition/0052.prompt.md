Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `i` if `s` is `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is `'<'`, or a list containing the value of `i` if `s` was `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `i` if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is `'<'`, includes the previous elements and the new value `i` if `s` is `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `s` is the string input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the string input by the user. If `s` equals `<`, `mak` is equal to `i` and `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. Otherwise, if `s` equals `=`, `pans` includes the current value of `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
