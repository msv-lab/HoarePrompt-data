The code snippet creates a list named `pans` and assigns it the value `[i]`. This means `pans` is now a list containing the current value of `i`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` remains an integer greater than 1.
- `mak2` remains the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
- `s` remains the new input string.
- `i` has been incremented by 1.
- `mak` is now equal to the incremented `i`.
- `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `s` is the new input string; `i` is incremented by 1; `mak` is equal to the incremented `i`; `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`.**
