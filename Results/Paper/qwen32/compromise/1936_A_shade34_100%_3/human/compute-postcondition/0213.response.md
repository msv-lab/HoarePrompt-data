The given code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, none of the variables `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, or `i` are altered.

Output State: **`mak` is `i` if the input is `'>'`; otherwise, `mak` remains `i - 1`, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list with at least `i + 1` elements, and `i` is `i`.**
