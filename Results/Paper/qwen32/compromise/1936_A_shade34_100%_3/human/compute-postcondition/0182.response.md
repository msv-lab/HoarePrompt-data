The provided Python code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call ensures that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. However, it does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, `pans`, `i`) are modified by the `sys.stdout.flush()` call. The only change mentioned in the initial state is that `i` is incremented by 1, but this increment operation is not shown in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the increment of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `pans` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1**.
