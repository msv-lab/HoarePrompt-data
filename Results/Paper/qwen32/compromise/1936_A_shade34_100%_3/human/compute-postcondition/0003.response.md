To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is initialized automatically by the `range` function in the loop. Therefore, we don't need to adjust its initial state before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `n`:** The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` requires `n` to be at least 2 to include any values in the iteration.

3. **Variable `t`:** This variable is mentioned as being an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). However, `t` is not used in the loop head, so it doesn't affect whether the loop will execute or not. We don't need to adjust `t`.

4. **Variable `mak`:** Similar to `t`, `mak` is not used in the loop head, so it doesn't affect the loop's execution. We don't need to adjust `mak`.

Given this analysis, the only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `n`. It must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0**
