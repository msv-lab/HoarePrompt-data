The value of `mak` is updated to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is the current value of `i`, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`.**
