The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `s`, or `i`.

Since `i` is mentioned to be incremented by 1 before the code snippet, we should reflect this increment in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `s` is the new input string; `i` is incremented by 1**.

In natural language: The value of `i` is increased by 1, while the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `s` remain unchanged.
