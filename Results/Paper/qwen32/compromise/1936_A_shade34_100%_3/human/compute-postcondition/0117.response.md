Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
- `s` is the new input string.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`mak`**: This variable is not mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, its value is unknown from the given information. We cannot determine what it is based on the provided context.
2. **`mak2`**: This variable is described as the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received. Its value depends on the inputs received during the execution of the program.
3. **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified. Thus, we only know that it has been incremented by 1 from whatever its previous value was.
4. **The print statement**: It prints a question mark (`?`), followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific values for `mak` and `i`, we can only describe their roles and the known value of `mak2`.

### Output:
Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where mak is an unknown variable, mak2 is the highest index i for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such input was received, and i is the current value after being incremented by 1)**
