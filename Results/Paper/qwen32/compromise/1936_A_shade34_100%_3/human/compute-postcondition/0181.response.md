Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for determining the output.
- `n`: Greater than 0. This variable is also not directly used in the print statement.
- `mak2`: The highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this. Since there's no information about any previous inputs, we assume `mak2` is 0.
- `mak`: The highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received. Similar to `mak2`, we assume `mak` is 0.
- `pans`: A list. This variable is not used in the print statement.
- `i`: Incremented by 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1, we need to know its initial value to determine its final value. However, the initial value of `i` is not specified. We'll assume `i` starts from 0, making its final value 1 after incrementing by 1.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Given the assumptions:
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.

### Output Calculation:
The print statement will output:
- `'?'`: A literal question mark.
- `mak`: The value of `mak` which is 0.
- `mak2`: The value of `mak2` which is 0.
- `i`: The value of `i` which is 1.
- `mak2`: The value of `mak2` which is 0 again.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 0 1 0**
