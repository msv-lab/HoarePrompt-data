To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. **`n`**: Greater than 1.
3. **`mak`**: 
   - If the input string was `'<'`, then `mak` is set to `i`.
   - Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
4. **`i`**: `i` is `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Determine the Value of `mak`**:
   - The value of `mak` depends on the input string.
   - If the input string was `'<'`, then `mak` is set to `i`.
   - Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Determine the Value of `i`**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

3. **Construct the Output**:
   - The `print` statement outputs the following sequence: `'?'`, `mak`, `mak`, `i`, `i`.

### Possible Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Input String is `'<'`
- If the input string is `'<'`, then `mak` is set to `i`.
- The `print` statement will output: `'?'`, `i`, `i`, `i`, `i`.

#### Scenario 2: Input String is Not `'<'`
- If the input string is not `'<'`, then `mak` remains 0.
- The `print` statement will output: `'?'`, `0`, `0`, `i`, `i`.

### Final Output Description:
Given the above scenarios, the output of the `print` statement will depend on the input string. However, we can describe it precisely based on the conditions:

- If the input string was `'<'`, the output will be: `'?'`, `i`, `i`, `i`, `i`.
- If the input string was not `'<'`, the output will be: `'?'`, `0`, `0`, `i`, `i`.

Since the exact input string is not specified, we need to account for both possibilities. Therefore, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **'? ', mak, mak, i, i (where mak is i if the input string was '<', otherwise mak is 0, and i is i + 1)**
