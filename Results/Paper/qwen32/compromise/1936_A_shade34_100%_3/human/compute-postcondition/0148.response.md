The code snippet provided sets the variable `mak` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, or `pans`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is the integer input provided by the user; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `mak` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`**.
