The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `mak`, which now holds the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is `i`, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='` and must contain at least two elements.**
