To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop head, we can identify that the loop variable `i` will iterate from 1 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. 

Let's analyze the given state and see what adjustments are needed:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\): This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution.
- `n` is the integer input provided by the user: This variable is crucial because it determines whether the loop will execute. For the loop to run, `n` must be greater than 1.
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received: This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution.
- `mak` is 0: This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`: This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution.

Given the above analysis, the only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`**
