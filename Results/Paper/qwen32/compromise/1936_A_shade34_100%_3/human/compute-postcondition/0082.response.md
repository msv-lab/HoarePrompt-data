The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

From the problem statement, we know:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n`.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the exact value of `i`, we can denote the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration as `i + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`. If the current input is `'<'`, then `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

To make it more concrete, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 3. Therefore, the state would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`. If the current input is `'<'`, then `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is 3.**

However, since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we generalize it as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`. If the current input is `'<'`, then `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

For clarity, let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `k + 1`. Therefore, the state would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`. If the current input is `'<'`, then `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is `k + 1`.**

Since `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the state as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`. If the current input is `'<'`, then `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`. If the current input is `'<'`, then `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Simplified for clarity:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`. If the current input is `'<'`, then `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`.**
