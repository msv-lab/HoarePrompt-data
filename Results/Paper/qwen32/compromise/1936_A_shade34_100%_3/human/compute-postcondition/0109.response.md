The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer for standard output, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received
- `s` is the input string
- `i` is incremented by 1

Since `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables, the only change is that `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `s` is the input string; `i` is incremented by 1**.
