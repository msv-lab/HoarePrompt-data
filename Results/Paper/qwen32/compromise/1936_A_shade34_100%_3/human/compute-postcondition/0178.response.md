Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, and `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if `s` is equal to `'='`. If `s` is not equal to `'='`, `pans` remains an empty list.**
