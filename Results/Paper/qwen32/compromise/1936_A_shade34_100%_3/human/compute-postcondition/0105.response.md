Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `s` is the input string. If `s` is equal to `'='`, `pans` is a list containing one element `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
