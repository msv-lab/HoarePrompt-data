The code reads a string input and assigns it to the variable `s`. This affects only the variable `s`, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `mak`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `pans` is an empty list; `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `s` is the input string.**
