Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the integer value provided by the user input.
- `mak2` is initialized to 0.
- `pans` is a list containing at least four elements.
- `mak` remains unchanged unless the user input is '>', in which case `mak` is set to 2.
- `i` is initialized to 3.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `mak` is initially not specified to have any particular value other than it being set to 2 if the user input is '>'. Since no user input is mentioned in the initial state, we assume `mak` retains its default value, which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred to be 0 (since `mak2` is 0 and there's no indication `mak` is different).
- `i` is explicitly set to 3.
- `pans` is a list with at least four elements, so `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` are valid accesses.

### Determining the Output:
- If `mak` is 0 (which is our assumption since no change is indicated), then `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
- Since `i` is 3, `pans[i]` is `pans[3]`.

Thus, the print statement will output:
- A literal question mark `'?'`.
- Two occurrences of `pans[0]`.
- Two occurrences of `pans[3]`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? pans[0] pans[0] pans[3] pans[3] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and pans[3] is the fourth element of the pans list)**
