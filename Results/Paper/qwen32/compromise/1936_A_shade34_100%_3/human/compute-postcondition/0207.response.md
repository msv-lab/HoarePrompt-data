Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `mak` is set to `i` if the input provided is `'>'`; otherwise, `mak` remains `0`.
- `mak2` is `0` (though it's not used in the print statement).
- `pans` is a list with at least `i + 2` elements.
- `i` is incremented by `1` (`i = i + 1`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `mak`:**
   - If the input is `'>'`, `mak` is set to `i`.
   - Otherwise, `mak` remains `0`.

2. **Value of `i`:**
   - Initially, `i` is some value.
   - After the increment, `i` becomes `i + 1`.

3. **List `pans`:**
   - `pans` is a list with at least `i + 2` elements.
   - This means that after the increment, `pans` has at least `(i + 1) + 2` elements, ensuring that `pans[i]` and `pans[mak]` are valid indices.

### Determining the Output:
- The print statement outputs:
  - `'?'` (a literal question mark),
  - `pans[mak]` (the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`),
  - `pans[mak]` (again, the same element),
  - `pans[i]` (the element at index `i` in the list `pans`),
  - `pans[i]` (again, the same element).

### Final Output Description:
- If the input is `'>'`, `mak` is `i`, so `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` refer to the same element in the list `pans`.
- If the input is not `'>'`, `mak` is `0`, so `pans[mak]` refers to the first element of the list `pans`, and `pans[i]` refers to the element at the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`).

Given these conditions, the output will be:

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where mak is i if input is '>', else 0, and i is incremented by 1)**

This ensures that the output reflects the correct values based on the initial state and the operations performed.
