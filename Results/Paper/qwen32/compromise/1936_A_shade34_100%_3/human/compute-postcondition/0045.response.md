The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the standard output. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than 0**.
