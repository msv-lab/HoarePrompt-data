The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. This means that `pans` will now include the new value of `i` at the end of the list. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `i` if `s` is `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list that includes the previous elements and the new value `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `s` is the string input.**
