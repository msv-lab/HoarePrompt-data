Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `s` is the new input string; `i` is incremented by 1. If `s` equals `'<'`, `mak` is equal to the incremented `i` and `pans` contains the value of `i`. If `s` equals `'='`, `pans` contains the new value of `i` appended to it.**
