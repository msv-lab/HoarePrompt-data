To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
- `mak` is set to `i` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise it remains 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='` and must contain at least two elements.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Let's analyze the values of the variables involved:

1. `mak`: This variable is set to `i` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise it remains 0. Since there's no specific information about any `'>'` input, we assume `mak` is 0 unless stated otherwise.
2. `pans`: This is a list of indices where the input was `'='`. We know it contains at least two elements, but the exact values of these indices are not specified.
3. `i`: This is the current index, which is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration. Without knowing the exact sequence of inputs, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.

However, since `mak` is either 0 or an index where the input was `'>'`, and `pans` is a list of indices where the input was `'='`, we can infer the following:

- If `mak` is 0, then `pans[mak]` would be `pans[0]`, which is the first index in the `pans` list where the input was `'='`.
- `pans[i]` depends on the value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, and without knowing the exact sequence of inputs, we can only say that `pans[i]` is some element in the `pans` list.

Given that `pans` contains at least two elements, let's denote the first two elements of `pans` as `pans[0]` and `pans[1]`. If `mak` is 0, then `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`. If `i` is 1 (which is a common scenario after the first iteration), then `pans[i]` would be `pans[1]`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement would be:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where pans[0] and pans[1] are the first two indices in the pans list where the input was '=')**
