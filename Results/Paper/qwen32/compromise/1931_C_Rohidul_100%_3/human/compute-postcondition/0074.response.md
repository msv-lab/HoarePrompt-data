Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is at least `3`; `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `2`; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is `3`; `end` is `1`; If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end)`**

In simple terms: The value of `st` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
