The code snippet provided increments the variable `l` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `l` was 1, so after the execution of `l += 1`, the value of `l` becomes 2. No other variables in the initial state are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[0]` equals `a[1]` and `a[1]` equals `a[2]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 2; `r` is at least 2; `st` is 2; `end` is 1; if `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`; otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**.
