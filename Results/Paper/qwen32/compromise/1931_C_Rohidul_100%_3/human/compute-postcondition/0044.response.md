To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `l` and `r`, and the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[0]` equals `a[1]` and `a[1]` equals `a[2]`
- `le` is the length of the list `a`
- `l` is 2
- `r` is at least 2
- `st` is 3
- `end` is 1
- if `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`; otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`

The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`. For the loop to execute again, both conditions must be true:
1. `l < r`
2. `a[l] == a[l + 1]`

From the provided state, `l` is 2. For the first condition `l < r` to hold, `r` must be greater than 2. For the second condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` to hold, `a[2]` must equal `a[3]`.

Since `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]`, we need to ensure that `a[3]` is also equal to `a[2]`. Therefore, `a[3]` must be equal to `a[2]`.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are `r` and `a[3]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[0]` equals `a[1]` and `a[1]` equals `a[2]` and `a[2]` equals `a[3]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 2; `r` must be greater than 2; `st` is 3; `end` is 1; if `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`; otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**
