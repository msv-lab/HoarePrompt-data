The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
