The loop increments `l` and `st` as long as the elements at positions `l` and `l + 1` in the list `a` are equal. The loop will terminate when either `l` is no longer less than `r` or `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the first 4 elements of the list `a` are all equal. The loop will continue to increment `l` and `st` as long as the next element is equal to the current one. The loop will stop when it reaches an element that is not equal to the previous one or when `l` reaches `r`.

The loop will terminate when `l` is no longer less than `r` or when `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]`. Therefore, the final state will be when `l` is the position of the first element that is not equal to the previous one, or `l` is equal to `r`.

Let's denote the length of the list `a` as `le`. If all elements in the list are equal, `l` will be `le - 1` and `st` will be `le`. If not all elements are equal, `l` will be the position right before the first element that is not equal to the previous one, and `st` will be the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start.

Given the pattern, the output state after all iterations will be:
- `l` will be the position right before the first element that is not equal to the previous one, or `le - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `st` will be the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start, or `le` if all elements are equal.
- `r` will remain `n - 1`.
- `t`, `n`, `a`, `le`, and `end` will remain unchanged.

Thus, the final output state will be:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is the position right before the first element that is not equal to the previous one, or `le - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start, or `le` if all elements are equal; `end` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the loop will continue to increment `l` and `st` as long as the elements are equal. When it finds an element that is not equal to the previous one, or when `l` reaches `r`, it will stop. The final values of `l` and `st` will reflect the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list.
