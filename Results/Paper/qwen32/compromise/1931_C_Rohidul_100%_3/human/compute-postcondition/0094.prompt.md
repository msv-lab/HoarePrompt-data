Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    le = len(a)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 1, 1
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    ans = le - max(st, end)
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is at least 2; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is the position right before the first element that is not equal to the previous one, or `le - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start, or `le` if all elements are equal; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list; if `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`; otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that `n <= le`; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 1`; `r` is the index where `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]` or `r` is equal to `l`; `st` is `n`; `end` is `k`. If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end)` and there is no change to other variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is the list of integers; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n - 2`; `st` is `n - 1`; `end` is `n - (n - 2) + 1`. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
