The code snippet assigns the value `0` to `l` and the value `n - 1` to `r`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `le` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**
