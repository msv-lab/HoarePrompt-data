Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is the list of integers where `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 4`; `r` is `n - 4`; `st` is `n - 1`; `end` is `4`; `ans` is `0` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `1`.**

The value of `end` is incremented by 1, so `end` is now `4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
