Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is the list of integers; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n - 2`; `st` is `n - 1`; `end` is `n - (n - 2) + 1`. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**.
