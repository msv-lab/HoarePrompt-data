The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the list `num`. According to the code, the loop iterates backward over the indices of the list `num`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `num` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case.
- `i` is the current index, and the loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`.
- If the current test case `num[i]` is '0', `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains 0 and `num[i]` is not equal to '0'.

Since the loop iterates backward, `i` is decremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration. Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, we need to decrease `i` by 1.

State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `i` is `i - 1`**
