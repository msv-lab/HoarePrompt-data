Precondition: **num is a list of test cases, where each test case is represented as a list containing two integers n and m, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The integers n and m satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, and each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
