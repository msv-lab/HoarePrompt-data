To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the calculation of the `shapes` variable.

### Analysis:

1. **Variables and Lists**:
   - `w` is defined as `w_initial + n - 1`, but it is not used in the calculation of `shapes`.
   - `ln` is an input integer, but it is also not used in the calculation of `shapes`.
   - `palka` is a list of integers.
   - `pl` is a list of integers.

2. **Dictionary `d`**:
   - `d` is a dictionary that contains counts of each unique element in the list `palka`. This means `d[j]` gives the number of occurrences of `j` in `palka`.

3. **Calculation of `shapes`**:
   - `shapes` is calculated as the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.
   - This means for each element `j` in `pl`, if `j` appears at least 3 times in `palka` (i.e., `d[j] >= 3`), then `d[j] // 3` (integer division of the count of `j` by 3) is added to `shapes`.

### Output:
The `print(shapes)` statement will output the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`. This sum represents the total count of groups of 3 occurrences of elements in `pl` that are also present in `palka`.

Given the information provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `shapes` without the specific contents of `palka` and `pl`. However, we can describe the value of `shapes` precisely based on the given conditions.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of d[j] // 3 for all j in pl where d[j] >= 3)**
