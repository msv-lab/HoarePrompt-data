The code snippet provided sets `pl` to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the value of `pl` is reset to an empty list, while `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`, and `shapes` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a new list of integers from the input, `pl` is [], `d` remains the dictionary with each unique element from the original `palka` as keys and their counts as values, `shapes` will be incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
