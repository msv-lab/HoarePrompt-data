The code snippet `pl.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `pl`. The variables `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `d` are not affected by this operation. The precondition that `i` is not in `pl` before this operation is no longer valid since `i` is now added to `pl`.

Output State: **`w` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers with at least one element, `pl` is a list that now includes `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, the value associated with key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.**
