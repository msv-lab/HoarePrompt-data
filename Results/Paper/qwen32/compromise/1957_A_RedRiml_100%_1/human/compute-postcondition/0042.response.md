`ln` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `w` remains unchanged as it is described in terms of its value at the end of the previous iteration, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`w` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `ln` is an input integer.**
