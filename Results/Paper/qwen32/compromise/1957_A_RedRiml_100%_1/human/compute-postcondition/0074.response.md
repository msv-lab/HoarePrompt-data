The code snippet `shapes += d[j] // 3` increments the value of `shapes` by the integer division of the count of the second element in `pl` (which is `j`) by 3. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code.

Given:
- `w` is `w_initial + n`
- `ln` is the input integer
- `palka` is the input list of integers
- `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements
- `d` is a dictionary with each unique element from `palka` as keys and their counts as values
- `j` is the second element in `pl`

The value of `shapes` will be updated by adding the integer division of `d[j]` by 3 to it.

Output State: **`w` is `w_initial + n`, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the input list of integers, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary with each unique element from `palka` as keys and their counts as values, `j` is the second element in `pl`, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3`.**
