The only variable in the loop head is `i` from the list `palka`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in `palka`. Since we don't have the exact contents of `palka`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next element.

Given that `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, and `i` is the current element being processed, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `palka`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 integer; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain `i` as its last element depending on whether `i` was not in `pl` initially; `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d` is updated to have the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, the value of the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka`**
