Output State: **`w` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers with at least one more element to process, `d` is a dictionary, and `i` is the next element in `palka` to be processed. If `i` was not already a key in `d`, `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the count of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. `pl` now includes `i` as its last element.**

In simple terms, the list `pl` now has the element `i` appended to it, while all other variables remain unchanged.
