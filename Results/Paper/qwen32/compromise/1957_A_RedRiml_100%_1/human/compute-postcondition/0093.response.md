The code snippet provided is `pl.append(i)`. This line of code appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Given the initial state, `pl` is a list that does not contain `i`, so after appending `i`, `pl` will now include `i`.

Here's the output state considering all the variables and their conditions:

Output State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list that now contains `i`, `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` becomes `{i: 1}`. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `shapes` will be incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `i` has been added to the list `pl`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
