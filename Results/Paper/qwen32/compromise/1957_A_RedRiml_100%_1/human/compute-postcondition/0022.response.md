Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 integer; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain `i` as its last element depending on whether `i` was not in `pl` initially; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.**

Explanation: The value of `d[i]` is set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
