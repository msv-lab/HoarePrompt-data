### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a significant flaw in the logic of `func_1(arr)`. The function incorrectly assumes that if the array is not already sorted in non-decreasing order, it cannot be sorted by performing the specified operation (splitting the array into a prefix and suffix and swapping them). This assumption is not valid because the operation allows for more complex rearrangements of the array elements.

To illustrate this, let's consider the provided counterexample `[3, 1, 2]`:

1. **Initial Array**: `[3, 1, 2]`
2. **Operation**: Split the array into `x=[3]` and `y=[1, 2]`, then swap them.
3. **Resulting Array**: `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order.

This shows that the array `[3, 1, 2]` can indeed be sorted by performing the allowed operation, even though it is not initially sorted.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly determine if an array can be sorted by the allowed operation, we need to check if there exists a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the second part (suffix) is less than or equal to the first part (prefix) when concatenated in reverse order.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Finding the point in the array where the order breaks (i.e., where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`).
2. Checking if the array can be split at this point such that the suffix can be moved to the front to form a sorted array.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the provided program. The function `func_1(arr)` does not correctly handle cases where the array can be sorted by more complex rearrangements through prefix and suffix swaps. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
