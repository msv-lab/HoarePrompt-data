Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element in `arr` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 0; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` is now assigned the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, while all other variables remain unchanged.
