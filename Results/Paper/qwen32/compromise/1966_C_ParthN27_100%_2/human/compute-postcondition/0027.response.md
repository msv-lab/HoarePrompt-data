The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the variable `ans` and the integer `1`. This operation will flip the least significant bit of `ans`. If `ans` was `0`, it becomes `1`, and if `ans` was `1`, it becomes `0`. However, the initial value of `ans` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the effect in terms of the operation performed.

Given that the initial state does not specify the value of `ans`, we can only say that `ans` will be flipped from its initial value. Assuming `ans` was initially `0` (a common default if not specified), after the operation, `ans` will be `1`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended to it, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1**.
