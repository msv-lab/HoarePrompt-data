To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case. The loop processes each test case independently, and the state after all iterations will reflect the final state of the variables after all test cases have been processed.

### Loop Behavior Recap:
1. **Input Reading**: For each test case, it reads `n` and a list of integers `arr`.
2. **Set Creation**: It creates a set `s` from `arr` to remove duplicates, converts it to a list, sorts it, and prepends `0` to it.
3. **Game Logic**:
   - If `n` (length of `s`) is 2, it directly prints "Alice".
   - If `n` is greater than 2, it iterates through the sorted list `s` and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is `<= 1`.
   - It uses a variable `ans` initialized to `1` and toggles it (`ans ^= 1`) whenever the difference is `<= 1`.
   - If the loop completes or breaks, it prints "Alice" if `ans` is `1` and "Bob" if `ans` is `0`.

### Final Output State:
After all test cases are processed, the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`, and `ans` will reflect the state of the last test case processed. However, since the loop processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately, the final state of these variables will not affect the output of previous test cases.

### Final Output State Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable is decremented in each iteration of the outer loop. After all test cases are processed, `t` will be `0`.
- **`n`**: This will be the length of the last `s` list processed.
- **`arr`**: This will be the list of integers from the last test case.
- **`s`**: This will be the sorted list of unique elements from the last `arr` with `0` prepended.
- **`i`**: This will be the last index reached in the loop for the last test case.
- **`ans`**: This will be the final value of `ans` after processing the last test case.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **t is 0, n is the length of the last s list processed, arr is the list of integers from the last test case, s is the sorted list of unique elements from the last arr with 0 prepended, i is the last index reached in the loop for the last test case, ans is the final value of ans after processing the last test case.**

In simple terms, after all the test cases have been processed, the loop will have finished executing with `t` being `0`, and the other variables (`n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`, `ans`) will reflect the state of the last test case processed.
