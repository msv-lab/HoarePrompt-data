The value of `n` is reassigned to the length of the list `s`. The list `s` contains all unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended to it, so the length of `s` is the number of unique elements in `arr` plus one (for the prepended `0`). The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended to it, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1.**
