Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing all unique elements from `arr`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `t` remains 1, `n` still holds the input integer value, and `arr` retains its original list of integers. The set `s` will contain all the unique elements from the list `arr`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, reflecting that the loop has completed its iterations up to the last index of the list `arr`.
