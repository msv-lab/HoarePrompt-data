Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s` which contains unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the integer input from the user. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is 1 or less.**
