The code modifies the list `s` by prepending a `0` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with a `0` prepended to it, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is either 0 or 1.**
