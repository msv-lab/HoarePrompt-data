The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation on the variable `ans` with 1. This operation flips the value of `ans` between 0 and 1. If `ans` was initially 1, it will become 0, and if `ans` was initially 0, it will become 1.

Given the initial state, `ans` is 1 if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1; otherwise, `ans` is 0. After the XOR operation, `ans` will be flipped to the opposite value.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with a `0` prepended to it, `i` is `n-2`, and `ans` is 0 if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1; otherwise, `ans` is 1.**
