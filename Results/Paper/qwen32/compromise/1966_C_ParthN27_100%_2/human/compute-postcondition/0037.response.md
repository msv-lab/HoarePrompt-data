The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`, `ans`), but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'Bob'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('Bob')`.
2. The string `'Bob'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
