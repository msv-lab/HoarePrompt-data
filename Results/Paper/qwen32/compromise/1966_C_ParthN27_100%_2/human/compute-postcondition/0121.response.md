Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` denoting the number of piles and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function processes these inputs and returns the result for each test case.**
