Output State: **t is 1, n is the integer value of the input, arr is the new list of integers from the input, s is a set containing all unique elements from arr, i is n-1, and ans is either 0 or 1.**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `s` will contain all the unique elements from the list `arr`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, reflecting the last index that was processed in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `s` is now populated with the unique elements from `arr`.
