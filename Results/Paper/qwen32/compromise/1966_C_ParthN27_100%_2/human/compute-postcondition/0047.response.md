The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. 

Given the initial state, `s` is initially a set containing `arr[i]` from the previous iteration. After executing the code, `s` will now contain the previous elements of `s` plus `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is an empty set containing the elements from the previous `s` plus `arr[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous value, and `ans` is either 0 or 1.**
