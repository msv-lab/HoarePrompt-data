The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is the length of the sorted list `s` which must be greater than 2. Since the loop runs from `1` to `n - 2` (inclusive), we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

Let's adjust the state:
- `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.
- `n` remains the same as it is the length of the list `s` and does not change within the loop.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s` which contains unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
