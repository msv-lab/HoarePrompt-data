The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first element of `arr`, `i` is 1**
