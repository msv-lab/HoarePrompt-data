The code snippet provided sorts the list `s` which contains all unique elements from the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation on `s`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is either 0 or 1.**
