The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is in the range from 1 to `n-2` (inclusive), the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, but since `i` is already at the upper bound of the range (`n-2`), the loop will not execute again in this iteration. However, if we consider the state right before the last iteration, `i` would have been `n-3`.

So, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `n-3`.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with a `0` prepended to it, `i` is `n-3`, and `ans` is 1 if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1; otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
