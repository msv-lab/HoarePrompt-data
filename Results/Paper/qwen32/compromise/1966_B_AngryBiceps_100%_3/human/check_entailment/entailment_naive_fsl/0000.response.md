Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the described operations. There are several cases where the program will output "YES" when it should output "NO".

For example, consider the following grid:
```
2 2
WB
BW
```
In this case, the program will output "YES", but it is impossible to make all squares the same color using the given operations. The program checks if the first and last rows and the first and last columns are uniform and different from each other, but this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.

Another example:
```
3 3
WBW
BWB
WBW
```
The program will output "YES" for this grid as well, but it is impossible to make all squares the same color using the given operations. The program's logic is flawed because it does not consider the entire grid but only checks the first and last rows and columns.

A correct approach would involve checking if the grid can be partitioned into subrectangles of uniform color, which is a more complex task than what the current program attempts to do.
