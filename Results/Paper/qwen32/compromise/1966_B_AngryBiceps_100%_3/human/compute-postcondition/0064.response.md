The code appends a new input string to the list `a`. Therefore, `a` now contains two strings: the original string and the newly appended string. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a`, `i` is `n`**.
