Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three strings (the original two strings and the new input string), `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a` and then concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a` again, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`**

Natural Language: The value of `first_row` has been updated by appending the first character of the last string in the list `a` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
