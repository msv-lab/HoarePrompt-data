The code snippet appends the last character of the third string in the list `a` to the `last_row` variable. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing three string elements (the original user input, the new user input, and the newly appended input); `first_row` is the original `first_row` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a` and then with the first character of the third string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the second string in `a` repeated twice followed by the last character of the third string in `a`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
