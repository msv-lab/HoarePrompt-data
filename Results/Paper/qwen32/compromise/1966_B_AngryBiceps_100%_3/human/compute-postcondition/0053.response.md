Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements which are the input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`. If the first string in `a` consists of identical characters, the last string in `a` also consists of identical characters, and these two strings are not equal to each other, then the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, either the set of characters in the first string `a[0]` does not have a length of 1, or the set of characters in the last string `a[-1]` does not have a length of 1, or the first string `a[0]` is equal to the last string `a[-1]`. Additionally, if the set of characters in `first_row` has a length of 1, the set of characters in `last_row` has a length of 1, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the conditions remain as specified in the if part. Otherwise, at least one of the following is true: the set of characters in `first_row` does not have a length of 1, the set of characters in `last_row` does not have a length of 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
