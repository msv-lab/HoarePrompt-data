The code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `m` based on the input. The initial values of `n` and `m` are overwritten by the values obtained from the input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements which are the input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`.**
