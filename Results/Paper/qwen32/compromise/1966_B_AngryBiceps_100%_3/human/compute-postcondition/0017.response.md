Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing `n` string elements (all user inputs); `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in `a`; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `t` remains the same as the initial integer input.
- `n` remains the number of iterations specified by the first input.
- `m` remains the second integer input.
- `a` contains all the strings that were input during the loop.
- `first_row` is a string made up of the first character of each input string.
- `last_row` is a string made up of the last character of each input string.
