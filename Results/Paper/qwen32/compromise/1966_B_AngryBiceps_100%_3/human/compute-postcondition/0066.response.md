The code snippet provided modifies the value of `last_row` by appending the last character of the last string in the list `a` to it. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is a list containing two input strings
- `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`
- `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a`
- `i` is `n`

After executing the code `last_row += a[-1][-1]`, the value of `last_row` changes to include the last character of the last string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is `n`**.

In simpler terms, the last character of the last string in `a` has been appended to `last_row`.
