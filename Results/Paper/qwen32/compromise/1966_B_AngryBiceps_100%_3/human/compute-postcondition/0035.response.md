The code snippet appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `last_row`. Given that `a` contains one element which is the input string, `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of that string. Therefore, `last_row` will now hold this last character.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input string, `first_row` is the first character of the input string, `last_row` is the last character of the input string.**
