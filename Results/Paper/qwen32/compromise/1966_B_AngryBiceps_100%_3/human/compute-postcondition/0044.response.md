Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements which are the input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `t` remains the same integer within the given range.
- `n` indicates how many times the loop ran, which is the number of input strings.
- `m` remains unchanged as it was the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a list that now contains all `n` input strings.
- `first_row` is a string formed by taking the first character from each of the `n` input strings and concatenating them.
- `last_row` is a string formed by taking the last character from each of the `n` input strings and concatenating them.
- `i` is the index of the last iteration, which is `n - 1`.
