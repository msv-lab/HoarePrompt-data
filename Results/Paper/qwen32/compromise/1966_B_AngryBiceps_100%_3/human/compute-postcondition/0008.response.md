The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the `last_row` string. Given that `a` contains only one string element, `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of that single string. Therefore, `last_row` will now hold this last character.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing one string element (the user input); `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`.**
