The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then constructs and prints a list `ans` of length `n` where the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The list is constructed by adding powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `k` and adjusting the last element to ensure the sum matches `k`.
