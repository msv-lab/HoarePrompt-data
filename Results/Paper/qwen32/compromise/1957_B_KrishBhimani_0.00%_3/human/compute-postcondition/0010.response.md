The code snippet `k = k >> 1` performs a right bitwise shift operation on `k`, which is equivalent to integer division by 2 (discarding the remainder).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is a non-zero integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `k0` is equal to `k`.
- `i` is 0.
- If `k` is odd, then `arr` is [0]. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.

After executing `k = k >> 1`, the value of `k` is halved (integer division by 2).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` divided by 2 (integer division); `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`; `i` is 0; if `k` is odd, then `arr` is [0]. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.**
