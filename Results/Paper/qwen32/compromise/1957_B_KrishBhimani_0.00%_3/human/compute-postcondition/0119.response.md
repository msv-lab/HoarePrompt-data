In the given for loop, the loop iterates over the elements in the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element since the loop will only run for each item in `arr`.

Let's analyze the provided state and identify which states need to be adjusted:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4: This state does not affect the loop's execution.
- `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string: This state does not directly affect the loop's execution, but it is used to initialize `n` and `k0`.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`: This state does not affect the loop's execution.
- `k` is 0: This state does not affect the loop's execution.
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`: This state does not affect the loop's execution.
- `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k_initial`: This state does not affect the loop's execution.
- `arr` is a list of indices where the corresponding bit in `k_initial` is 1: This state directly affects the loop's execution.
- `c` is 0: This state does not affect the loop's execution.
- `ans` is an empty list: This state does not affect the loop's execution.

Since the loop iterates over `arr`, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `arr`. Specifically, `arr` must contain at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k_initial`, `arr` is a list of indices where the corresponding bit in `k_initial` is 1 and must have at least one element, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list**. 

However, to make it clear that the only necessary adjustment is for `arr` to have at least one element, we can simplify the state as:

State: **`arr` must have at least one element**.
