The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` was 0, so after the execution, `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is `k // 2`; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is 1; `arr` is `[0]` if `k0` is odd, otherwise `arr` remains `[]`; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.**
