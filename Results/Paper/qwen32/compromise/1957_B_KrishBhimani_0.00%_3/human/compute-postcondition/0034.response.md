Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current `i`; `arr` is a list with at least one element; `ans` is `[0, 1, k0 - 1]` if `c == n - 1`, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1]`; `c` is `n - 1` if we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `c` retains its original value + 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. If `c == n - 1` before the break, `ans` remains `[0, 1, k0 - 1]`; otherwise, it is `[1, k0 - 1]`. The value of `c` is set to `n - 1` if we break out of the loop or if statement. All other variables retain their previous values.
