The given code snippet appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length equals `n`. Therefore, if the length of `ans` is less than `n`, the difference is filled with zeros.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `1 << i` for each element in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, then `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended if `c` reaches `n - 1`, and `ans` is padded with zeros to a length of `n`.**

In simpler terms, the list `ans` is extended with zeros so that its length becomes `n`. All other conditions and values remain as they were initially described.
