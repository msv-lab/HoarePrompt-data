Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must contain at least one element; `c` is an integer such that `c < n - 1` or `ans` is a list containing the single element `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `c` is increased by 1; `ans` is a list that includes the element `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, the loop or if statement is broken out of and `ans` includes the elements `1 << i` and `k0 - (1 << i)`.**
