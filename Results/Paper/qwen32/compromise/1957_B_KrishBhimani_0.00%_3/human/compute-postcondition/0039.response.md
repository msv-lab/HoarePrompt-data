Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current `i`; `arr` is a list with at least one element; if `c == n - 1`, `ans` is `[0, 1, k0 - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1]` and `c` retains its original value + 1; `c` is increased by 1; `ans` includes an additional element `1 << i`; `ans` now includes an additional element `k0 - sum(ans)`**

In natural language: The variable `ans` has an additional element appended to it, which is the result of `k0 - sum(ans)`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
