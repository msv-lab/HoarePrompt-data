Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` divided by 4 (integer division) and `k` must be greater than 0; `k0` is equal to the original value of `k` divided by 2 (integer division); `i` is 2; if `k0` is odd, then `arr` is [0, 1, 2]. Otherwise, `arr` is [1, 2].**

Explanation: The value of `arr` is updated by appending the value of `i` (which is 2) to it. The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, and `i` remain unchanged.
