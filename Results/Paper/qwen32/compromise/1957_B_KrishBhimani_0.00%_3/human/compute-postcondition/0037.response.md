The provided code snippet appends the result of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. This operation shifts the number 1 to the left by `i` places, which is equivalent to calculating 2 raised to the power of `i`.

Given the initial state, the value of `ans` will be updated by appending the new value `1 << i`. The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, `c`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current `i`; `arr` is a list with at least one element; if `c == n - 1`, `ans` is `[0, 1, k0 - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1]` and `c` retains its original value + 1; `c` is increased by 1; `ans` includes an additional element `1 << i`.**
