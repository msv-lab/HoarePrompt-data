The code snippet provided is:

```
arr = []
```

This line of code reassigns the variable `arr` to be an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `k0` is 0; `i` is the last element in `arr`; `arr` is []; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.**

In natural language: The variable `arr` is now an empty list. All other variables retain their previous values.
