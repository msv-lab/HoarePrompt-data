Output State: **`arr` must have at least two elements; `c` is incremented by 1; `ans` has one additional element equal to `1 << i` and another additional element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` before the new element was appended; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only terminates the current loop or if statement. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except that we have just exited the most internal loop or if statement.
