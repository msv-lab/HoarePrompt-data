The only variable in the loop head is `k`. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `k` is not zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is some integer value derived from the integer division of the second element of `l1` by 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0.

Thus, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` divided by 2 (integer division) and `k` must be greater than 0; `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`; `i` is 1; if `k0` is odd, then `arr` is [0]. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.**
