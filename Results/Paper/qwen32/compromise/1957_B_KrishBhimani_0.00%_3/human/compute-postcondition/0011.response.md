Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` divided by 2 (integer division); `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`; `i` is 1; if `k` is odd, then `arr` is [0]. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
