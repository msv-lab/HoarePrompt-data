The code `l1 = input().split()` takes an input string from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `l1`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string.**
