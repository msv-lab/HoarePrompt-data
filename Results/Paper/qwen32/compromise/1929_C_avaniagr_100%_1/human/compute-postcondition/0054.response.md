The only object in the loop head is the variable `s`. The loop iterates over each line in the input file starting from the second line, treating each line as a string. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next line in the input file.

Since the loop head only involves `s`, we need to adjust `s` to represent the next line in the input file. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are derived from `s`, and `z` is set within the loop body, so they do not need to be adjusted in the loop head.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a string containing three space-separated integers. For the next iteration, `s` should be the next line from the input file, which is also expected to be a string containing three space-separated integers.

State: **`s` is the next line from the input file, which is a string containing three space-separated integers**.
