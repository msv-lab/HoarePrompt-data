Output State: **`s` is the next line from the input file, which is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers derived from splitting and converting `s`; `z` is `k - 2`.**

This means that after executing the code, the value of `z` is calculated as `k - 2`, while the values of `s`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.
