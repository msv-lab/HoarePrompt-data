The code snippet updates the value of `z` based on its current value and the value of `k`. Let's calculate the new value of `z`:

Given:
- `z` is initially `k - 1`
- The operation performed is `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`

Since `z` is initially `k - 1`, we substitute `z` with `k - 1` in the operation:
- `z = (k - 1) + (k - 1) // (k - 1) + 1`
- `z = (k - 1) + 1 + 1` (since `(k - 1) // (k - 1)` is 1 for any `k > 1`)
- `z = k + 1`

The values of `s`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing three space-separated integers, `k` is the first integer from `s`, `x` is the second integer from `s` and `x >= k`, `a` is the third integer from `s`, `z` is `k + 1`, `i` is 1.**
