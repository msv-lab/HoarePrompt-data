Postcondition: **`s` is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k` is the first integer from `s`, `x` is the second integer from `s`, `a` is the third integer from `s`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the condition in the if part is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition in the else part is satisfied. In both cases, the values of `s`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.**
