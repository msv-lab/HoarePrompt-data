Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `s` is a string containing three space-separated integers.
- `k` is the first integer from `s`.
- `x` is the second integer from `s`.
- `a` is the third integer from `s`.
- The current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`.
- `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`.

The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `k`, `x`, or `a`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
