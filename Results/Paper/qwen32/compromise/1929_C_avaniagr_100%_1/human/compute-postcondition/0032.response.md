The code snippet takes a string `s` that contains three space-separated integers, splits the string into individual components, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. The initial state of `s` is a string containing these integers, and after the code execution, `k`, `x`, and `a` will hold the specific integer values extracted from `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k` is the first integer from `s`, `x` is the second integer from `s`, `a` is the third integer from `s`.**
