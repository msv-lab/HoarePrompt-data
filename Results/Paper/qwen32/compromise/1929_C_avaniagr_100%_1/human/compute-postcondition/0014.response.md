Postcondition: **`s` is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k` is the first integer from `s`, `x` is the second integer from `s`, `a` is the third integer from `s`. The current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`. `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, then `a` remains greater than or equal to `x + 2`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 2`.**
