### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Transformation Logic:**
   - The program only performs a single pass through the array and only splits the previous element if it is greater than the current element and greater than 10. This is insufficient to guarantee that the array can be sorted.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 10, 3]`. After the first pass, the array becomes `[1, 2, 10, 3]`. The element `10` should be split into `1` and `0`, but the program does not handle this because it only performs one pass and does not check the newly inserted elements.

2. **Multiple Passes Required:**
   - The program should continue to iterate through the array and attempt to split elements until no more splits are possible or the array is sorted. A single pass is not sufficient to handle all necessary transformations.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or where splitting does not help in sorting the array. For example, an array like `[0, 0]` is already sorted, but the program might incorrectly attempt to split `0` which is not necessary.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary correctly describes `func_1` as checking if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, since the transformation logic is flawed, the function will not always return the correct result.

### Conclusion:

Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
