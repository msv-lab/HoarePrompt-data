Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to determine if it is possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its individual digits. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it iterates through the list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and is at least 10. If both conditions are met, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them back into the list at the same position. After processing the list, it checks if the list is sorted using the `func_1` function.

However, there are a few issues with the provided program:
1. The program only performs one pass through the list and splits the first element it finds that is greater than the next element and is at least 10. It does not continue to process the list after making the split, which means it may not correctly handle cases where multiple splits are needed.
2. The program does not handle the case where the element to be split is greater than 99, as the current splitting logic only works for two-digit numbers.
3. The program does not handle the case where the list is already sorted or can be sorted without any splits.

In the given example, the program will correctly identify that the first test case can be sorted by splitting the first element (12) into (1, 2), but it will incorrectly identify the second test case as "YES" because it only makes one pass through the list and does not handle the case where multiple splits are needed.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should repeatedly iterate through the list and perform splits until no more splits are needed, and then check if the list is sorted.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
