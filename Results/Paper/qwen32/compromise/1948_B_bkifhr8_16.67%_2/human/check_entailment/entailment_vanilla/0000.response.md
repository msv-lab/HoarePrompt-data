Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if a given integer array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its individual digits.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and then the array itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the array and checks if an element is greater than the next element and if it is at least 10.
   - If such an element is found, it splits the element into its individual digits and inserts them back into the array at the same position.
   - The splitting operation is performed by dividing the number by 10 to get the tens digit and using the modulus operation to get the units digit.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After attempting to sort the array by splitting elements, the program calls `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.
   - `func_1` compares the array with its sorted version and returns `True` if they are the same, indicating the array is sorted.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Yes" if the array can be sorted and "No" otherwise.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic:** The program only performs one split operation when it encounters an unsorted pair. However, this might not be sufficient to sort the array. For example, if we have an array like `[12, 11]`, the program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 11]` but will not further split `11` because it is in the correct position relative to `2`. However, `[1, 2, 11]` is still not sorted.
- **Infinite Loop Potential:** The program does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed to sort the array. It only checks adjacent elements once and does not re-check the entire array after each split.
- **Sorting Check Placement:** The sorting check is performed only once after the initial pass through the array, which is insufficient if multiple splits are needed.

### Correctness Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. It fails to handle scenarios where multiple splits are required and does not ensure that the array is fully sorted after attempting to split elements.

**Correctness: False**
