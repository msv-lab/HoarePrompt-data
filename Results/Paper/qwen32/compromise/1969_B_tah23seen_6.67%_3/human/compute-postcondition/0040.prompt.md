Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\). `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar`. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', the elements at `left` and `right` indices in `s` are swapped, `left` remains the index of the first '1' in `s` before the swap, `right` is `len(s) - 1`, and `cost` is increased by `right - left + 1`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged, `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`, and `right` is `len(s) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\). `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` and the last element of `s` is '1'. `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`, and `right` is `len(s)`. `cost` is initialized appropriately.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\). `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` and the last element of `s` is '1'. `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`. `right` is `len(s)`. `cost` is initialized appropriately.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
