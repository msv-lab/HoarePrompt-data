The value of `right` is incremented by 1. Since `right` was initially set to `len(s) - 2`, after the increment, `right` becomes `len(s) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\). `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` and the last element of `s` is '1'. `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`. `right` is `len(s) - 1`. `cost` is initialized appropriately.**
