The code snippet `cost += right - left + 1` increments the variable `cost` by the value of `right - left + 1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` with the element at `left` index moved to `right` index and the element at `right` index moved to `left` index.
- `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` before the swap.
- `right` is `len(s) - 1`.

The value of `cost` is incremented by `right - left + 1`. The values of `sChar`, `s`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` with the element at `left` index moved to `right` index and the element at `right` index moved to `left` index; `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` before the swap; `right` is `len(s) - 1`; `cost` is increased by `right - left + 1`.**
