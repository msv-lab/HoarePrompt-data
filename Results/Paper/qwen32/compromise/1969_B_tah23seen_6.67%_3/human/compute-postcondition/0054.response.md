To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `right < len(s)`
2. `s[right] != '0'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `right` is `len(s) - 1`
- `left` is `3` (though `left` is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need adjustment)
- `s[len(s) - 2]` is not '0'

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. `right < len(s)`:
   - Since `right` is `len(s) - 1`, this condition is false because `len(s) - 1` is not less than `len(s)`.
   
2. `s[right] != '0'`:
   - This condition is true because `s[len(s) - 1]` is not '0' (since `s[len(s) - 2]` is not '0' doesn't give us information about `s[len(s) - 1]`, but we assume it's not '0' based on the problem statement).

Since the first condition `right < len(s)` is false, the loop will not execute again with the current state. To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `right` so that `right < len(s)` is true.

Therefore, we need to decrement `right` by 1 so that `right` becomes `len(s) - 2`.

Adjusted State:
- `right` should be `len(s) - 2`
- `left` remains `3`
- `s[len(s) - 2]` is not '0' (no change needed here)

State: **`right` is `len(s) - 2`, `left` is `3`, and `s[len(s) - 2]` is not '0'**
