The code swaps the elements at the `left` and `right` indices in the list `s`. Given that `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` and `right` is the last index of `s`, the swap will move the first '1' to the end of the list and the character at the end of the list to the position of the first '1'.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` with the element at `left` index moved to `right` index and the element at `right` index moved to `left` index; `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` before the swap; `right` is `len(s) - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the first '1' in the list `s` is swapped with the last element of the list `s`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged except for the positions of the elements at the `left` and `right` indices in `s`.
