The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` with `s[0]` being '0'; `left` is 1; `right` is len(s)**.
