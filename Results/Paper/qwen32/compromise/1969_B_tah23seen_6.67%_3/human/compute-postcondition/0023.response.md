To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1**: `left < len(s)`
   - This condition ensures that `left` is a valid index within the list `s`.
   - Given that `left` is initialized to 0 and `s` is a list containing all the elements of `sChar`, `len(s)` should be at least 1 for this condition to hold true.

2. **Condition 2**: `s[left] != '1'`
   - This condition ensures that the element at the `left` index in `s` is not '1'.
   - Since `left` is 0 initially, `s[0]` should not be '1' for the loop to execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Ensure `len(s)` is at least 1**: This is already satisfied as `s` is a list containing all the elements of `sChar`, and each string in `sChar` has a length between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\). Therefore, `s` will always have at least one element.
- **Ensure `s[0]` is not '1'**: We need to adjust the first element of `s` (and hence `sChar`) to be something other than '1'. The simplest adjustment would be to set `s[0]` to '0'.

### Final State:
Given these considerations, the state right before the loop should be adjusted such that `s[0]` is '0'.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` with `s[0]` being '0'; `left` is 0; `right` is len(s)**
