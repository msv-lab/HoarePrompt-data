The given code snippet initializes a variable `cost` to 0. This does not affect the values of `sChar`, `s`, or `left`. 

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar`; `left` is 0; `cost` is 0.**
