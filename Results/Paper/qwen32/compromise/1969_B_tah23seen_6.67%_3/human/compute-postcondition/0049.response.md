The code swaps the characters at indices `right` and `left` in the string `s`. Given the initial state, `right` is `len(s) - 1` and `left` is `3`. After the swap, the characters at these positions in `s` are exchanged.

Output State: **`right` is `len(s) - 1`, `left` is `3`, and the characters at indices `right` and `left` in `s` are swapped.**
