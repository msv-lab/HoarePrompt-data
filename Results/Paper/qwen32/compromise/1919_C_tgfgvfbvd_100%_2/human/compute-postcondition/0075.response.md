Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` and `b` are updated based on the value of `l[x]` relative to `b`, `c` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x` is incremented by 1. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged. If `l[x]` is greater than `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` is updated to the previous value of `a`, and `c` is updated to 1, 2, or 3 based on the conditions specified.**
