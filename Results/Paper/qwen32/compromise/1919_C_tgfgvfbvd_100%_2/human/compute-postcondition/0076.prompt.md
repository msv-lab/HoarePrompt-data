Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0; `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` and `b` are either `float('inf')` or the value of `l[x]`, `c` is either 0 or 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` and `b` remains `float('inf')`. If `l[x]` is greater than `a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`, `b` remains `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is either the value of `l[x]` or the previous value of `b`, `b` is either the value of `l[x]` or the previous value of `a`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. `x` is `x + 1`. If `l[x] <= a`, then `a` remains the value of `l[x]`. Otherwise, if `l[x] <= b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x] > b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` and `c` is updated to 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` and `b` are updated based on the value of `l[x]` relative to `b`, `c` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x` is incremented by 1. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged. If `l[x]` is greater than `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` is updated to the previous value of `a`, and `c` is updated to 1, 2, or 3 based on the conditions specified.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
