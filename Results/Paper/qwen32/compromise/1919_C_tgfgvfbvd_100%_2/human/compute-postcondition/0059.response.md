The code snippet `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Given the initial state, `a` and `b` are either `float('inf')` or the value of `l[x]`. After the swap, the value of `a` will be the previous value of `b`, and the value of `b` will be the previous value of `a`.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is either `float('inf')` or the value of `l[x]` (previous value of `b`), `b` is either `float('inf')` or the value of `l[x]` (previous value of `a`), `c` is either 0 or 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `x + 1`**.
