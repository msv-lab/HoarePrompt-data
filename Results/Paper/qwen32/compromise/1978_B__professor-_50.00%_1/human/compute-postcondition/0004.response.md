Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the conditions involving `n`, `a`, and `b`. The final state of the program is that it outputs `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of the respective test case.**
