You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code:

    #State: For each of the `t` test cases, the output will be the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the modified `nums` list. The modifications for each test case are independent and do not affect the others.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
- There should be no subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `k`.
- For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program generates a sequence using powers of 2 and then modifies it to ensure the conditions are met. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).

2. **Finding the Index**:
   - It finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Modification**:
   - It removes this power of 2 from `nums`.
   - It appends three new numbers to `nums`: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the length of the modified `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
   - The program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by removing a specific power of 2 and adding new numbers. However, it does not guarantee that no combination of the remaining numbers will sum to `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All `v`**:
   - The program aims to cover all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`. However, the approach of using powers of 2 and modifying them might not cover all possible sums for arbitrary `n` and `k`.

### Testing Specific Cases:
Let's test the program with some specific cases to see if it works correctly:

#### Case 1:
- Input: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
- Expected Output: A sequence where no subsequence sums to 2, and 1 can be formed.
- Program Output: `1\n1` (Correct)

#### Case 2:
- Input: `n = 6`, `k = 1`
- Expected Output: A sequence where no subsequence sums to 1, and sums from 2 to 6 can be formed.
- Program Output: `5\n2 3 4 5 6` (Correct)

#### Case 3:
- Input: `n = 8`, `k = 8`
- Expected Output: A sequence where no subsequence sums to 8, and sums from 1 to 7 can be formed.
- Program Output: `7\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1` (Incorrect, as it doesn't cover all sums from 1 to 7)

#### Case 4:
- Input: `n = 9`, `k = 3`
- Expected Output: A sequence where no subsequence sums to 3, and sums from 1 to 9 except 3 can be formed.
- Program Output: `4\n7 1 4 1` (Incorrect, as it doesn't cover all sums from 1 to 9 except 3)

#### Case 5:
- Input: `n = 10`, `k = 7`
- Expected Output: A sequence where no subsequence sums to 7, and sums from 1 to 10 except 7 can be formed.
- Program Output: `4\n1 2 8 3` (Incorrect, as it doesn't cover all sums from 1 to 10 except 7)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases as demonstrated by the specific test cases above. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
