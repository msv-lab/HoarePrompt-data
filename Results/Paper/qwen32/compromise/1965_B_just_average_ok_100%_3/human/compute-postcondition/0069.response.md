To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `nums` is a predefined list of integers `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1]`.
- `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k` or -1 if no such index exists.
- `i` is the index at which the loop terminates (though `i` is not used in the provided code snippet).

### Code Execution:
The code snippet provided is:
```python
nums.remove(1 << idx)
```
This line removes the element from the list `nums` that is equal to `1 << idx`. Here, `1 << idx` is equivalent to `2^idx`.

### Impact on Variables:
- The list `nums` will have one element removed, specifically the element `2^idx`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `idx`, `i`) remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Given the above analysis, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`] with `2^idx` removed; `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k` or -1 if no such index exists; `i` is the index at which the loop terminates.**

In simpler terms, the list `nums` will have the element `2^idx` removed, while all other variables retain their initial values.
