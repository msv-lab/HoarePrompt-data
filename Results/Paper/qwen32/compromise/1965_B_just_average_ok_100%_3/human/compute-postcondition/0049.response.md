The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the initial values of `n` and `k` (which were described as "the first integer from the input" and "the second integer from the input") are updated to the values provided by the user input.

The values of `t`, `nums`, and `idx` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, k - 1048576, k + 1, 2*k - 1048575], `idx` is 20.**

In simpler terms: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user input, while `t`, `nums`, and `idx` retain their original values.
