To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case are `i` and the length of `nums`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `len(nums)` is greater than 0 because `range(len(nums))` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `len(nums)`. If `len(nums)` is 0, the loop will not execute.

From the provided state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2.
- `idx` is -1.

Since `nums` is a predefined list with 21 elements, `len(nums)` will always be 21, ensuring that the loop will execute as long as the list remains unchanged.

However, the task specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `len(nums)`). Since `len(nums)` is determined by the contents of `nums` and we cannot change the contents of `nums` directly, we only need to ensure that the loop variable `i` is appropriately initialized.

Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but since the loop initializes `i` to 0 when it starts, there's no need to adjust `i` beforehand.

Therefore, no specific adjustment is needed for `i` or `len(nums)` based on the given constraints and the nature of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is -1**
