Let's analyze the given Python code snippet and determine the output state based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `nums` is a predefined list containing powers of 2 up to 1048576.
- `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or `-1` if `k` is greater than 1048576.

### Code Execution:
```python
nums.append(k - nums[idx])
```

### Impact Analysis:
- The code appends a new element to the list `nums`.
- The new element is calculated as `k - nums[idx]`.

### Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `nums` now includes an additional element, which is `k - nums[idx]`.
- `idx` remains unchanged.

### Natural Language Description:
The list `nums` now contains an additional element, which is the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`], and `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (excluding the newly added element) that is less than or equal to `k`, or `-1` if `k` is greater than 1048576.**
