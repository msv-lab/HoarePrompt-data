The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Given the initial state, `nums` initially contains 22 elements, and `idx` is set to 20. After appending `k + 1`, `nums` will have 23 elements.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the input, nums is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - 1048576, k + 1], idx is 20.**
