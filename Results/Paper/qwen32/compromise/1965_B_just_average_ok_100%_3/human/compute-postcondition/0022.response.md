To determine the output of the `print(len(nums))` statement, let's break down the initial state and how the list `nums` is constructed:

1. **Initial List Construction**: 
   - `nums` starts as a predefined list of powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.

2. **Determine `idx`**:
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (excluding the newly added elements) that is less than or equal to `k`, or `-1` if `k` is greater than 1048576.
   - This means `idx` will be the position of the largest power of 2 in the initial `nums` list that is ≤ `k`.

3. **Additional Elements in `nums`**:
   - The following elements are added to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]` (if `idx` is not -1)
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1` (if `idx` is not -1)
     - `1 << idx` is excluded from the list.

Let's analyze the length of `nums` after these additions:

- The initial `nums` list contains 21 elements.
- Depending on the value of `k`:
  - If `k` is greater than 1048576, `idx` will be `-1`, and no additional elements will be added except `k + 1`. Therefore, `nums` will have 22 elements.
  - If `k` is less than or equal to 1048576, `idx` will be a valid index, and three additional elements will be added (`k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`), but one element (`1 << idx`) will be excluded. Therefore, `nums` will still have 23 elements.

In both cases, the length of `nums` will be either 22 or 23. To provide a precise answer, we need to consider the two scenarios:

- If `k > 1048576`, `len(nums) = 22`.
- If `k ≤ 1048576`, `len(nums) = 23`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only describe the possible lengths based on the conditions provided.

Output: **22 or 23 (depending on whether k is greater than 1048576 or not)**
