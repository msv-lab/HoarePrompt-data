The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than the length of `nums`.

Given that `nums` is a predefined list with 21 elements (from 1 to 1048576), the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 21.

So, if `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration, it would be 4 at the start of the next iteration. The loop will continue until `i` reaches 21.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is 4**
