The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `nums`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Since the loop iterates over the indices of `nums`, the next value for `i` should be 2. The list `nums` does not change throughout the iterations, so it remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is 0, `i` is 2**
