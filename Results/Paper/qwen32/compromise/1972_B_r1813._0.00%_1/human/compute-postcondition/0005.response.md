The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `data`, or `index`) are modified by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `results` while keeping other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `int(data[0])`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings resulting from `sys.stdin.read().split()`, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
