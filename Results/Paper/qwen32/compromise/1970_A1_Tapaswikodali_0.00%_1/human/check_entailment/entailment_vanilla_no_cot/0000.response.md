Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step verification:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `balance` to 0 and an empty list `details` to store the prefix balance, negative position, and character for each position in the input string.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The program iterates through the input string `s`. For each character, it updates the `balance` (incrementing for '(', decrementing for ')') and appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list. The `-i` is used to ensure that ties in prefix balance are broken by position in decreasing order.

3. **Sorting**: The `details` list is sorted. Python's tuple sorting will sort primarily by the first element (prefix balance), and in case of ties, by the second element (negative position), which effectively sorts positions in decreasing order.

4. **Result Construction**: The program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the result string.

The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements, and the program handles the constraints correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
