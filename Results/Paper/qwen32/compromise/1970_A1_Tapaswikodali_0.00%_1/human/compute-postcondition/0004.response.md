To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze how the variables `balance` and `details` change with each iteration of the loop.

The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the character `char`. For each character:
- If the character is `'('`, `balance` is incremented by 1.
- If the character is `')'`, `balance` is decremented by 1.
- Regardless of the character, a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` is appended to the `details` list.

Since the initial value of `balance` is 0, and the string `s` is not specified, we can describe the final state of `balance` and `details` in terms of the net effect of the operations on `balance` and the sequence of operations recorded in `details`.

Let's assume the string `s` is provided and consists of a sequence of `'('` and `')'`. The final `balance` will be the net count of `'('` minus the count of `')'`. The `details` list will contain a sequence of tuples representing the state of `balance`, the negative index, and the character at each step.

However, without a specific string `s`, we can't provide exact values. Instead, we can describe the output state in a general form.

Output State: **`balance` is the net count of `'('` minus the count of `')'` in the string `s`, and `details` is a list of tuples `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in `s`.**

If we were to provide a specific example, let's assume `s = "(()())"`:

- For `i=0, char='('`, `balance=1`, `details=[(1, 0, '(')]`
- For `i=1, char='('`, `balance=2`, `details=[(1, 0, '('), (2, -1, '(')]`
- For `i=2, char=')'`, `balance=1`, `details=[(1, 0, '('), (2, -1, '('), (1, -2, ')')]`
- For `i=3, char='('`, `balance=2`, `details=[(1, 0, '('), (2, -1, '('), (1, -2, ')'), (2, -3, '(')]`
- For `i=4, char=')'`, `balance=1`, `details=[(1, 0, '('), (2, -1, '('), (1, -2, ')'), (2, -3, '('), (1, -4, ')')]`
- For `i=5, char=')'`, `balance=0`, `details=[(1, 0, '('), (2, -1, '('), (1, -2, ')'), (2, -3, '('), (1, -4, ')'), (0, -5, ')')]`

So for `s = "(()())"`, the output state would be:
Output State: **`balance` is 0, and `details` is `[(1, 0, '('), (2, -1, '('), (1, -2, ')'), (2, -3, '('), (1, -4, ')'), (0, -5, ')')]`.**

Since the string `s` is not provided, we'll describe the output state in a general form as mentioned earlier. 

Output State: **`balance` is the net count of `'('` minus the count of `')'` in the string `s`, and `details` is a list of tuples `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in `s`.**
