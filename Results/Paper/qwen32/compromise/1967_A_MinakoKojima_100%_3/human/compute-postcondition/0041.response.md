Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 1. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * dif`, `ans` is updated to `ans + dif`, and `res` is updated to `res - 2` if `dif` is 0, otherwise `res` is updated to `res - 1`. If `k < dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + k // 2`, `res` is updated to `res + k % 2`, and if `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. In both cases, `k` becomes 0 if the else part is executed.**
