Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, and if `i` is not 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. In the latter case, `k` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The execution of the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. The loop or if statement is terminated, and the program continues from the next statement after the loop or if statement. All previous conditions and variable states remain the same.
