The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `i` is 1, and `k`, `ans`, and `res` remain as per the conditions described in the precondition**.
