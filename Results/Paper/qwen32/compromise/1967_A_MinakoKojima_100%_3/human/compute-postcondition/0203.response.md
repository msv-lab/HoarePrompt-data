The code snippet `ans += res` updates the value of `ans` by adding `res` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans_list` contains all previous values of `ans` plus the final value of `ans`; `ans` is updated to `ans + res + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`; `k` is 0 or not 0; `n` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged; `res` is unchanged.**

In simpler terms, `ans` has been updated to include the addition of `res` to its previous value, while all other variables retain their initial states.
