The given code snippet only initializes an empty list `ans_list`. No other variables are affected or modified by this code. The initial state provides details about the test cases, including the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins `k`, and the number of cards of each type `a_i`. Since none of these variables are used or modified in the provided code snippet, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **Each test case consists of two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12), where a_i represents the number of cards of type i initially available. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) is provided at the beginning, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5. `ans_list` is an empty list.**
