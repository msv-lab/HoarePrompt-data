The code snippet `ans += res` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `res` to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Given that `ans` was previously updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)` and `res` is defined as `n - 1` minus the number of non-zero and zero differences plus `k % n` if `k` is not equal to 0, the new value of `ans` will be the sum of its previous value and `res`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are as per the input, `a` is the same sorted list, `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `res`, `res` is `n - 1` minus the number of non-zero and zero differences plus `k % n` if `k` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ans` and `res` remain unchanged.**
