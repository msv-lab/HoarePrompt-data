Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `dif` is not 0, `ans` is updated based on the value of `k` relative to `dif * (i + 1)`, and `k` and `res` are adjusted accordingly. If `k` was not 0 and `i` was not 0, `res` is further adjusted by `k % (i + 1)` and `k` is set to 0.**
