Output State: **`i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is further increased by `k % (i + 1)`. `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `i`, `n`, `dif`, `res`, and `ans` remain as they were before the `break` statement. The only change is that the loop or if statement is exited.
