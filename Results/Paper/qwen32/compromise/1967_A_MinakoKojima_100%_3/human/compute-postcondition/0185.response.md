Output State: **`i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1; `ans` is increased by `dif`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `dif` to it. The values of `i`, `n`, and `dif` remain unchanged. The condition for decreasing `res` by 1 if `dif` is 0 is still valid and could affect `res` in subsequent iterations.
