Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are as per the input, `a` is the same sorted list. If `k` is not equal to 0, `ans` is updated by adding `k // n` to its previous value, `res` is `n - 1` minus the number of non-zero and zero differences plus `k % n`. If `k` is equal to 0, there is no change to `ans` and `res`.**
