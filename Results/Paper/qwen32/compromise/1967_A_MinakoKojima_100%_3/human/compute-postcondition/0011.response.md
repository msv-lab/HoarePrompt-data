Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `ans` is the smallest element in the list `a`, `i` is 0, and `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`. If `dif` equals 0, then `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `res` remains `n - 1`.**
