The code calculates the difference between the first two elements of the sorted list `a` and assigns it to the variable `dif`. None of the other variables (`ans_list`, `ans`, `res`, `k`, `n`, `a`, `i`) are modified by this statement.

Output State: **`ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`, `ans` is updated to `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0 if exhausted, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.**
