Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is the newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the first element of `a`, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` and is not 0, if `i` is not 0, `res` is `n - 1`, otherwise, `res` is `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
