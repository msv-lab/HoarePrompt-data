The variable `dif` is assigned the value of the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans_list`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the new value of `dif`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.**
