The variable `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the sorted list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. Since `a` is sorted, `a[0]` is the smallest element in the list.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `ans` is the smallest element in the list `a`.**
