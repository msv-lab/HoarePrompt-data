Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`; `ans` is updated to `a[0]`; `res` is `n - 1`; `k` is 0 if exhausted; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`. If `dif` is not 0, then `k` is 0. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)` was true before entering the if condition, then `ans` is updated to `a[0] + dif` and `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `a[0] + k // (i + 1)` and `res` is `(n - 1) + (k % (i + 1))` if `i` is not 0, and `res` is `n - 1` if `i` is 0. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `n - 2` and `k` remains 0. `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2. `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input. `i` is either 0 or not 0. `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is not equal to 0, the values of `k`, `ans`, `res`, and `dif` remain as per the initial conditions described in the precondition. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `k` was originally 0, `k` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif` and `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)` and if `i` is not 0, `res` is further increased by `k % (i + 1)`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. After the if-else block, `k` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
