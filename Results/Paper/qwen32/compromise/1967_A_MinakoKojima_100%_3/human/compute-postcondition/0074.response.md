The code snippet provided assigns the value `n - 1` to the variable `res`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, or `ans_list`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are as per the new input, `a` is the newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the first element of `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it.**
