Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `i` is 2, `k` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the conditions, and `res` is updated based on the conditions. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `dif` is not 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
