### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that the logic in `func_1` and `func_2` correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement.

**Function `func_1`:**
- This function calculates the minimum number of tents required for the extroverts and universals, given the constraints.
- **Logic:**
  - If the number of extroverts (`extroverts`) is not divisible by 3, it checks if the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is at least 3. If not, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to the rules.
  - If the above condition is satisfied, or if `extroverts` is divisible by 3, it calculates the minimum number of tents required by dividing the total number of extroverts and universals by 3 and rounding up using `ceil`.

**Function `func_2`:**
- This function calculates the total number of tents required for all participants.
- **Logic:**
  - It first calls `func_1` to determine the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so it returns `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents required for introverts (`introverts`) and the result from `func_1`.

**Verification with the Example:**
- Let's verify the first test case (`1 2 3`):
  - `introverts = 1`, `extroverts = 2`, `universals = 3`
  - `func_1(2, 3)`:
    - `extroverts % 3 != 0` (2 % 3 != 0)
    - `extroverts % 3 + universals = 2 + 3 = 5` (which is >= 3)
    - `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2`
  - `func_2(1, 2, 3)`:
    - Calls `func_1(2, 3)` which returns `2`
    - Returns `1 + 2 = 3`
- This matches the expected output for the first test case.

- Let's verify the second test case (`1 4 1`):
  - `introverts = 1`, `extroverts = 4`, `universals = 1`
  - `func_1(4, 1)`:
    - `extroverts % 3 != 0` (4 % 3 != 0)
    - `extroverts % 3 + universals = 1 + 1 = 2` (which is < 3)
    - Returns `None`
  - `func_2(1, 4, 1)`:
    - Calls `func_1(4, 1)` which returns `None`
    - Returns `-1`
- This matches the expected output for the second test case.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, and the logic aligns with the problem description.
