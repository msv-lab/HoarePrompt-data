The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state describes `t` and also mentions that each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. However, the code snippet only reads the integer `t` and does not affect `x` and `y` directly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively.**
