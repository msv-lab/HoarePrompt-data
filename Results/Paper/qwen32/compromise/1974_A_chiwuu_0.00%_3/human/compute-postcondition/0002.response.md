To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand how the code processes each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `t` is initialized to the number of test cases.
2. **Loop Execution**: For each test case, the following steps are performed:
   - Read two integers `a` and `b` from the input.
   - Calculate `t` as `b * 2`.
   - If `t` is divisible by 5, set `t` to `t // 5`; otherwise, set `t` to `t // 5 + 1`.
   - Calculate `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, calculate `t2` as `a - t1`. Then, if `t2` is divisible by 15, increment `t` by `t2 // 15`; otherwise, increment `t` by `t2 // 15 + 1`.
   - Print the value of `t` after these calculations.

The output state after the loop finishes executing all iterations will be the final values of `t` for each test case, printed one per line.

Let's denote the final values of `t` for each test case as `t1, t2, ..., tk` where `k` is the number of test cases.

Output State: **the final values of `t` for each test case, printed one per line.**

Since the exact input values are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical output state. However, the format of the output state after all iterations will be the final values of `t` for each test case, printed one per line.
