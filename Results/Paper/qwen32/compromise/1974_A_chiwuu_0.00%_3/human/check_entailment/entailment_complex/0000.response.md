Let's analyze the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The program needs to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to fit a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. The logic of the code is as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases, `n`, is read first.
   - For each test case, two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons) are read.

2. **Calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons:**
   - `t = b * 2` calculates the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.
   - Since a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, `t` is the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons, which is `b * 4`. However, the code uses `t = b * 2` which seems incorrect at first glance. The intention seems to be to calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. The correct approach would be to calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit in a screen and then determine the number of screens needed.
   - The code then calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons as `t = t // 5 + 1` if `t % 5 != 0`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the actual area occupied by 2x2 icons (each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, not 2 cells).

3. **Calculating the remaining space for 1x1 icons:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. This is incorrect because `t` is not the correct number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
   - If the remaining space (`t1`) is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons, the number of screens remains `t`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Correct Approach:
- First, determine how many 2x2 icons can fit on one screen. Since each screen is 5x3, it can fit a maximum of 2 2x2 icons (one in the top-left corner and one in the bottom-right corner, leaving some cells unused).
- Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
- Calculate the remaining cells available after placing the 2x2 icons.
- Place the remaining 1x1 icons in the available cells, and if more cells are needed, calculate the additional screens required.

### Code Correction:
Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = b // 2
        if b % 2 != 0:
            screens_for_2x2 += 1
        
        # Calculate remaining 2x2 icons that don't form a full screen
        remaining_2x2 = b % 2
        
        # Calculate the number of cells occupied by these remaining 2x2 icons
        cells_occupied_by_remaining_2x2 = remaining_2x2 * 4
        
        # Calculate the remaining cells on the last screen for 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells_on_last_screen = 15 - cells_occupied_by_remaining_2x2
        
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining cells
        remaining_1x1 = a - remaining_cells_on_last_screen
        
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = 0
        if remaining_1x1 > 0:
            additional_screens_for_1x1 = remaining_1x1 // 15
            if remaining_1x1 % 15 != 0:
                additional_screens_for_1x1 += 1
        
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. The logic for calculating the number of screens for 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
