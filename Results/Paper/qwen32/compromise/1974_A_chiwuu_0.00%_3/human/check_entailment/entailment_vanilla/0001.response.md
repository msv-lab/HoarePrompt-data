Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have a grid of size 5x3 (15 cells) for each screen.
- There are two types of icons: 1x1 and 2x2.
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.

### Key Points:
1. **2x2 Icons**: Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since the grid is 5x3, the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a single screen is 3 (as 3 * 4 = 12, leaving 3 cells unused).
2. **1x1 Icons**: After placing 2x2 icons, the remaining cells can be filled with 1x1 icons.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `t = b * 2` seems to be an incorrect step. It should be `t = b` because we need `b` screens for `b` 2x2 icons, each occupying 4 cells.
   - The program then calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons by dividing `b` by the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a screen (which is 3). This is done correctly using integer division and rounding up if there is a remainder.

3. **Calculation for 1x1 Icons**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining cells available.
   - It then calculates how many additional screens are needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons. This is done by checking if the remaining cells are sufficient to place the 1x1 icons and rounding up if necessary.

### Issues in the Program:
- The line `t = b * 2` is incorrect. It should be `t = b` to correctly calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
- The logic for calculating the remaining cells and additional screens for 1x1 icons seems correct but is convoluted.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        # Calculate screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b + 2) // 3  # Each screen can fit 3 2x2 icons
        # Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        # Calculate screens needed for 1x1 icons
        if remaining_cells >= a:
            screens_for_1x1 = 0
        else:
            screens_for_1x1 = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15  # Each screen has 15 cells
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)

# Call the function to run the program
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a critical error in the calculation of screens needed for 2x2 icons. After correcting this error, the program should work correctly.

Correctness: **False**
