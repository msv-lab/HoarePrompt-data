The code snippet assigns a specific value to the variable `check`, which is `2 ** 31 - 1`. This value is a constant and does not depend on any other variables or input. The initial state of other variables (`times`, `t`, `n`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`times` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case there is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 <= a_j < 2^31. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `check` is 2147483647.**
