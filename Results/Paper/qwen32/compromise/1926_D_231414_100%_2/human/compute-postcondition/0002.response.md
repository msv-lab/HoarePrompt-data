Given the for loop statement, the only variable in the loop head is `_` and `times`. The loop will execute if `times` is greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `check`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `times` is greater than 0.

State: **`times` is an input integer and must be greater than 0**
