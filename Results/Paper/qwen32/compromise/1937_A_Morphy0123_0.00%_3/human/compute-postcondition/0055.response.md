Postcondition: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` remains unchanged; `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^power ≥ n. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^power ≥ n minus 1, and `power` is not equal to `n`.**
