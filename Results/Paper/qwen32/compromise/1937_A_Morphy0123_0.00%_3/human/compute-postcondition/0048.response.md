Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` must be greater than 8; `power` is 4.**

Explanation: The value of `power` is incremented by 1, changing it from 3 to 4. The other variables (`n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged with their respective conditions and values.
