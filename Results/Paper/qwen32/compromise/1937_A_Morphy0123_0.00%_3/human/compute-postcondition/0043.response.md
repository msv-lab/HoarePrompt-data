To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `power` and `log2(n)`.

The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`. For the loop to execute, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`. Given that `power` is initialized to 1, we need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 1.

The logarithm base 2 of `n` (denoted as `log2(n)`) is greater than 1 when `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 2.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` must be greater than 2; `power` is 1**

This ensures that the condition `power < log2(n)` is satisfied, allowing the `while` loop to execute its first iteration.
