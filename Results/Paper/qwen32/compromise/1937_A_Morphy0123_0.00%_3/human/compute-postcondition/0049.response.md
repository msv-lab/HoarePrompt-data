To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop condition is `while power < log2(n)`. The variable `power` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration. The loop will terminate when `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`.

From the given output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration, `power` becomes 2, meaning `log2(n) > 1` or `n > 2`.
- After 2 iterations, `power` becomes 3, meaning `log2(n) > 2` or `n > 4`.
- After 3 iterations, `power` becomes 4, meaning `log2(n) > 3` or `n > 8`.

We can generalize this pattern. After `k` iterations, `power` becomes `k + 1`, and the condition `log2(n) > k` must hold, meaning `n > 2^k`.

The loop will terminate when `power` is equal to `log2(n)`, or in other words, when `2^power = n`. Therefore, the final value of `power` will be `ceil(log2(n))`, where `ceil` is the ceiling function that rounds up to the nearest integer.

Thus, the final state of the loop will be:
- `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.
- `i` will have been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n_cases` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the input to the loop.

In natural language, the final output state is that `power` will be the smallest integer such that `2^power` is greater than or equal to `n`. All other variables remain in their initial state except for `power`.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` remains unchanged; `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^power ≥ n.**
