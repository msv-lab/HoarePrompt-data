Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` must be greater than 4; `power` is 3.**

Natural Language: The value of `power` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables (`n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
