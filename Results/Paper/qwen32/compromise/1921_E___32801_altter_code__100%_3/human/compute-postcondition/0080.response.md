Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - 1)` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`. `r` is a list of integers, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as described in the initial state, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `(x2 - x1)` is an even number, `y2` is greater than or equal to `1` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `y1` is greater than `y2`, `a` is `1 - 1` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to `1`, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `y1` is `1` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `y1` is `m`, `y2` is `r[5]` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `y2` is `y2 + (m - y1)`, `c` is `t`. At least one of the following conditions is false: `b // 2 > a`, `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c`, `1 <= y1 <= m`, `1 <= x1 <= n`.**
