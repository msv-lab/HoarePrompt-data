Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list of integers, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as described in the initial state. Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`. `(x2 - x1)` is an even number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, `a` is `y1 - 1`; otherwise, `a` is `m - y1`. `b` is `x2 - x1`.**
