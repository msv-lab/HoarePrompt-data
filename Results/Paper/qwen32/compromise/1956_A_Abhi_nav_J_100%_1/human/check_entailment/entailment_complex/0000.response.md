### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the length of the sequence `a` and the number of queries `n_i`.
   - It then reads the sequence `a` and the list of queries `n_i`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to simulate the game process for a single query `b` (which corresponds to `n_i` in the problem statement).
   - According to the problem, the function should simulate the rounds of the game where players at positions specified by the sequence `a` are removed until no more players can be removed.
   - However, the provided `func_1` does not simulate the game process at all. Instead, it performs a simple comparison between the first element of `a` and `b` and returns either `a-1` or `b` based on this comparison.
   - This behavior does not match the expected logic of the game as described in the problem statement.

3. **Execution States:**
   - The comments suggest that the function should handle the game logic, but the actual implementation does not do so.
   - The function does not account for the removal of players in subsequent rounds, nor does it correctly determine the number of winners based on the game rules.

### Conclusion:

Given that the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement, the program cannot produce the correct results for the given problem.

**Correctness:** **False**
