### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of the boxes (s1) to the desired state (s2) using the allowed operations: adding a cat, removing a cat, or moving a cat from one box to another.

The key observation here is that moving a cat from one box to another can be thought of as a combination of removing a cat from one box and adding a cat to another box. Therefore, the number of moves required is determined by the larger of the two quantities: the number of cats that need to be added (cats_to_add) or the number of cats that need to be removed (cats_to_remove).

Here's the breakdown of the solution:
1. **Count the Cats to Add**: This is the number of positions in the desired state (s2) that are '1' but are '0' in the initial state (s1). This represents the cats that need to be added to achieve the desired state.
2. **Count the Cats to Remove**: This is the number of positions in the initial state (s1) that are '1' but are '0' in the desired state (s2). This represents the cats that need to be removed to achieve the desired state.
3. **Determine the Minimum Operations**: The minimum number of operations required is the maximum of the two counts (cats_to_add and cats_to_remove). This is because each move operation can be thought of as either adding or removing a cat, and we need to account for the larger of the two discrepancies.

The given program correctly implements this logic. It calculates the number of cats to add and the number of cats to remove, and then returns the maximum of these two values, which is the minimum number of operations required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state to the desired state.

**Correctness: True**
