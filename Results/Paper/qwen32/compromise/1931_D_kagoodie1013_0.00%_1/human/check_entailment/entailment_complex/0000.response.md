### Reasoning:

The given program processes multiple test cases to find the number of beautiful pairs in each array. A pair \((i, j)\) is considered beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). The program uses modular arithmetic to efficiently count such pairs.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - For a pair \((i, j)\) to be beautiful, \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) and \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\).
   - This can be rewritten as:
     - \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\)
     - \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\)

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of elements with specific remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each element `num` in the array:
     - It calculates `mod_x = -num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
     - It increments the count by the number of elements seen so far that have the same `mod_x` and `mod_y` values.
     - It updates the counts in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the current element.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic using modular arithmetic to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - The logic for updating the counts and checking the conditions for beautiful pairs is correct.
   - However, there is a discrepancy in the provided output states. The given output states in the comments do not match the expected output for the provided test cases. The expected output for the given test cases is:
     - For the first test case: 2
     - For the second test case: 0
     - For the third test case: 1
     - For the fourth test case: 3
     - For the fifth test case: 5
     - For the sixth test case: 7
     - For the seventh test case: 0
   - The provided output states in the comments show `[6, 13, 3, 3]`, which do not match the expected output.

Based on the above reasoning, the program's logic seems correct, but the provided output states in the comments are incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
