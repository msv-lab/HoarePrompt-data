### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotations provided.

#### Problem Recap
We need to find the number of beautiful pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in the array where:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

This translates to:
- \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\)
- \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\)

#### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The input is read and split into a list of strings.
   - The number of test cases `t` is extracted.
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are read, followed by the array `arr` of length `n`.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each test case, two dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are initialized.
   - The program iterates over each element `num` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
     - It adds the counts of these remainders from the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to the `count` of beautiful pairs.
     - It updates the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the positive modulo of `num` with `x` and `y` respectively.

#### Issues in the Program

The main issue identified in the original assessment is the calculation of `mod_x` as `-num % x`. This is indeed incorrect because:
- The condition \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\) requires the correct handling of negative remainders to ensure they are within the range \([0, x-1]\).

The correct approach should be:
- Calculate `mod_x` as `(x - num % x) % x` to ensure the remainder is non-negative.
- Calculate `mod_y` as `num % y`.
- Use these values to update the count of beautiful pairs and the dictionaries.

#### Annotations and State Evaluation

The annotated code shows the state of the program before the function call and the state of `results` after the function call:
- The state before the function call is correct: `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing the problem parameters and arrays.
- The state after the function call shows `results` as `[6, 13, 3, 3]`.

However, comparing this with the expected output for the given example:
- Expected output for the test cases is `[2, 0, 1, 3, 3, 5, 0]`.

Clearly, the results `[6, 13, 3, 3]` do not match the expected output, indicating that the program is not correctly counting the beautiful pairs.

#### Conclusion

Given the incorrect calculation of `mod_x` and the mismatch between the program's output and the expected output, the program does not correctly solve the problem.
