### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. According to the problem, a pair of indices `<i, j>` is considered beautiful if:
1. `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

The program uses two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. The logic involves iterating through the array and for each element, checking how many previous elements can form a beautiful pair with the current one.

However, there seems to be an issue with the way the program calculates the remainders and updates the counts. Specifically, the calculation of `mod_x` as `-num % x` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `num % x` for both conditions. The current implementation will not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs because of this mistake.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs due to the incorrect calculation of `mod_x`.
