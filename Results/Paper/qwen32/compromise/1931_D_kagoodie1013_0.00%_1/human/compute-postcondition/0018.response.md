Initial State: `test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 1; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 1}`; `mod_y_map` is `{2: 1}`; `arr` must be a list with at least two elements; `mod_x` is 0; `mod_y` is 2; `mod_y_key` is 2; `num` is the second element of `arr`; `mod_x_key` is 2`

The code snippet provided is:
```
mod_y_key = num % y
```

Given that `num` is the second element of `arr`, and `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `num` is `2`. Also, `y` is `mod_y`, which is `2`. Therefore, `mod_y_key` becomes `2 % 2`, which is `0`.

The variables `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, `arr`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `num`, and `mod_x_key` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 1; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 1}`; `mod_y_map` is `{2: 1}`; `arr` must be a list with at least two elements; `mod_x` is 0; `mod_y` is 2; `mod_y_key` is 0; `num` is the second element of `arr`; `mod_x_key` is 2`**
