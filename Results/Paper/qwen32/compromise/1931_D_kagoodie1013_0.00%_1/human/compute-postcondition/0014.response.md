To determine the output state, let's evaluate the given code snippet and update the variables accordingly.

Initial State:
- `test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`
- `results` is an empty list
- `count` is 0
- `mod_x_map` is `{2: 1}`
- `mod_y_map` is `{2: 1}`
- `arr` must be a list with at least two elements
- `mod_x` is 2
- `mod_y` is 3
- `mod_y_key` is 2
- `num` is the second element of `arr`

The code snippet provided is:
```python
mod_x = -num % x
```

From the initial state, we know that `num` is the second element of `arr`. Since `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, which is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `num` is `2`.

The variable `x` is not defined in the initial state or in the provided code snippet. However, since `x` is used in the calculation of `mod_x`, we need to infer its value. Given the context and the fact that `x` is not provided, we can assume that `x` is the first element of `arr`, which is `1` (as per the tuple in `test_cases`).

Now, let's calculate `mod_x`:
```python
mod_x = -num % x
mod_x = -2 % 1
mod_x = 0
```

The value of `mod_x` is updated to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 1}`; `mod_y_map` is `{2: 1}`; `arr` must be a list with at least two elements; `mod_x` is 0; `mod_y` is 3; `mod_y_key` is 2; `num` is the second element of `arr`**.
