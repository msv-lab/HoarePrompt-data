The code snippet `mod_x_map = {}` reassigns the `mod_x_map` variable to an empty dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13]; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is {}; `mod_y_map` is {5: 1, 2: 5, 0: 1, 1: 1}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].**
