The code snippet `mod_x = -num % x` modifies the value of `mod_x` based on the current values of `num` and `x`. Given the initial state, we know that `test_cases` contains a tuple with `arr` as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and `num` is the third element of `arr`, which is `3`. The value of `x` is not explicitly given in the initial state, but it can be inferred from the tuple in `test_cases` as the first element, which is `5`.

So, `mod_x` is updated to `-num % x`, which translates to `-3 % 5`. The result of `-3 % 5` is `2` because the modulo operation in Python returns the remainder of the division, and the result has the same sign as the divisor.

Here is the Output State:
Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 1; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 2}`; `mod_y_map` is `{2: 1, 0: 1}`; `arr` must be a list with at least two elements; `mod_x` is 2; `mod_y` is 2; `mod_y_key` is 0; `num` is 3; `mod_x_key` is 2**
