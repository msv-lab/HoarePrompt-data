To determine the output state, we need to calculate the new value of `mod_x` based on the provided code snippet and the initial state.

Given:
- `num` is the third element of `arr`
- `arr` is a list with at least three elements
- `x` is 4

From the initial state, `test_cases` is provided as `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]`. Since `count` can be 0, 1, or 2, we need to consider the possible values of `num` based on the `test_cases`.

If `count` is 0, `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, so `num` is 3.
If `count` is 1, `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, so `num` is 8.
If `count` is 2, no specific `arr` is given for this case, but we can assume it follows a similar pattern. However, for the sake of this calculation, we will consider the provided `test_cases`.

Let's calculate `mod_x` for both possible values of `num`:

1. If `num` is 3:
   \[
   mod_x = -3 \% 4 = 1
   \]

2. If `num` is 8:
   \[
   mod_x = -8 \% 4 = 0
   \]

Therefore, `mod_x` can be either 1 or 0.

Output State: **`test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13]; `count` is either 0, 1, or 2; `mod_x_map` is {1: 2} or {6: 1, 1: 1} or {1: 3} or {6: 2, 1: 1}; `mod_y_map` is {1: 1, 2: 1} or {6: 1, 2: 1} or {1: 2, 2: 1} or {6: 2, 2: 1} or {1: 1, 7: 1} or {6: 1, 7: 1} or {1: 2, 7: 1} or {6: 2, 7: 1}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is a list with at least three elements; `num` is the third element of `arr`; `mod_x` is either 1 or 0; `mod_y` is either 2 or 7; `mod_x_key` is 1; `mod_y_key` is either 2 or 7**.
