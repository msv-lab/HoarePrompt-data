The code snippet updates the value of `mod_y_key` by calculating `num % y`. Given that `num` is 10 and `y` is 8, the calculation `10 % 8` results in 2. Therefore, `mod_y_key` is updated to 2.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]`; `results` is `[6]`; `count` is `6`; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 2}`; `mod_y_map` is `{5: 1, 2: 3}`; `n` is `6`; `x` is `4`; `y` is `8`; `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`; `mod_x` is `2`; `mod_y` is `2`; `mod_x_key` is `2`; `mod_y_key` is `2`; `num` is `10`.**
