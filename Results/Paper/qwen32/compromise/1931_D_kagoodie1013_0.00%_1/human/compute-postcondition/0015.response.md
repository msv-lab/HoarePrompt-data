To determine the output state, we need to consider the provided initial state and the code snippet. The code snippet modifies the value of `mod_y` by setting it to the result of `num % y`. However, `y` is not defined in the initial state. Given the context, we can assume that `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, which is 7. 

The value of `num` is given as the second element of `arr`, but `arr` is specified as the fourth element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, which is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Therefore, `num` is 2.

Now, let's calculate the new value of `mod_y`:
- `mod_y = num % y`
- `mod_y = 2 % 7`
- `mod_y = 2`

The value of `mod_y` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 1}`; `mod_y_map` is `{2: 1}`; `arr` must be a list with at least two elements; `mod_x` is 0; `mod_y` is 2; `mod_y_key` is 2; `num` is the second element of `arr`.**
