The code snippet `mod_x_key = num % x` calculates the modulus of `num` with `x` and assigns it to `mod_x_key`. Given the initial state, `num` is not defined in the provided variables, but we can infer that `num` is likely intended to be `n` based on the context. Therefore, we will use `n` for the calculation.

Given `n` is `6` and `x` is `4`, the calculation becomes `mod_x_key = 6 % 4`, which results in `mod_x_key` being `2`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]`; `results` is `[6]`; `count` is `0`; `mod_x_map` is `{}`; `mod_y_map` is `{}`; `n` is `6`; `x` is `4`; `y` is `8`; `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`; `mod_x` is `0`; `mod_y` is `6`; `mod_x_key` is `2`.**
