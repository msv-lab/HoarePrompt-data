arr is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, representing the length of the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that needs to be constructed. The function will be called multiple times (up to 10^4 times) with different values of n and corresponding arr lists, and the sum of all n values across these calls will not exceed 2 * 10^5.
