The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `i` is `n - 2`, after the operation `i -= 1`, the value of `i` becomes `n - 3`.

The values of `arr`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \), `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where the first \( n-2 \) elements are `10`, the \( n-1 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2]`, and the last element is `10`, `i` is `n - 3`**.
