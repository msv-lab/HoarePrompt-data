To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the pattern that emerges from the loop's behavior. 

The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n - 2` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration. The loop continues until `i` is less than 0. The loop modifies the `ans` list such that `ans[i]` is set to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

Let's break down the pattern based on the provided output states:

1. **After 1 iteration**:
   - `ans[n-2] = ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`
   - `ans[n-1]` remains `10`
   - `i` becomes `n-3`

2. **After 2 iterations**:
   - `ans[n-3] = ans[n-2] - arr[n-3]`
   - `ans[n-2]` remains `10 - arr[n-2]`
   - `ans[n-1]` remains `10`
   - `i` becomes `n-4`

3. **After 3 iterations**:
   - `ans[n-4] = ans[n-3] - arr[n-4]`
   - `ans[n-3]` remains `10 - arr[n-2] - arr[n-4]`
   - `ans[n-2]` remains `10 - arr[n-2]`
   - `ans[n-1]` remains `10`
   - `i` becomes `n-5`

Following this pattern, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `-1`, meaning it will execute `n-1` times in total.

By the end of the loop:
- `ans[n-1]` remains `10`
- `ans[n-2]` becomes `10 - arr[n-2]`
- `ans[n-3]` becomes `10 - arr[n-2] - arr[n-3]`
- `ans[n-4]` becomes `10 - arr[n-2] - arr[n-3] - arr[n-4]`
- ...
- `ans[0]` becomes `10 - arr[n-2] - arr[n-3] - ... - arr[0]`

So, the final `ans` list will have its elements calculated as cumulative differences from the end of the `arr` list.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0] = 10 - (arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[n-2])`, `ans[1] = 10 - (arr[1] + ... + arr[n-2])`, ..., `ans[n-2] = 10 - arr[n-2]`, and `ans[n-1] = 10`; `i` is `-1`.**

In simpler terms, the final `ans` list will have each element calculated as the cumulative difference from the end of the `arr` list, starting from `ans[n-1]` which remains `10`, and `ans[0]` which is the result of subtracting the sum of all elements in `arr` except the last one from `10`.
