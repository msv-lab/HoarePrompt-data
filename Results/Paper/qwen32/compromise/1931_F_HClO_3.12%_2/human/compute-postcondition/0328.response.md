The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given the initial state, executing `continue` will not change the values of any variables because there is no code following `continue` that would affect the variables. Therefore, the state of all variables remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is 2, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is -1, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is equal to or less than `idx2`**.
