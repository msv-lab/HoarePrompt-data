The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no loop structure (`for` or `while`), so the `continue` statement does not have any effect. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`) are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; the current value of `m` is 1.**
