The code provided will take a new input, split it into integers, and then unpack these integers into `a3` and `l3`. Since the input is not specified, we can only describe the output state in terms of the new values assigned to `a3` and `l3`. The variables `val` and `m` are not affected by this line of code, except that `m` was incremented by 1 in the initial state, so we keep that information.

Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3), `m` is incremented by 1.**
