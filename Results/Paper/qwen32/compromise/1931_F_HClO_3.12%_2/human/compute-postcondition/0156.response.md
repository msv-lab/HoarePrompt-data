The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`.**
