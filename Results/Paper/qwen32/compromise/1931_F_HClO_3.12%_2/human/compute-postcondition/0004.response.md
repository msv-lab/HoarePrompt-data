The code snippet `input()` reads a line of input from the user but does not assign it to any variable, so the value is essentially discarded. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this operation. The initial state specifies that `m` is 1, and this value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; the current value of `m` is 1.**
