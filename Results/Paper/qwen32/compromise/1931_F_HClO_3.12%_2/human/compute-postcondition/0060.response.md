The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to adjust only `i` for the loop to execute one more time. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Given that the loop condition is `for i in range(n - 1)`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no additional changes occur. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` >= 0 and `idx2` >= 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no such break occurs.**

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to set `i` to the next value it should take, which is `i + 1` from the previous state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no additional changes occur. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` >= 0 and `idx2` >= 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no such break occurs.**

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not provided, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` from the previous state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**

Given the format, the final state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those
