The only variables in the loop head are `a3` and `l3`, which are unpacked from the tuples in the list `val`. For the loop to execute, `val` must contain at least one tuple. Given that `val` currently contains `m - 2` tuples, we need to ensure that `m - 2` is at least 1, which means `m` must be at least 3. 

Since the loop iterates over each tuple in `val`, the state of `a3` and `l3` will be determined by the first tuple in `val` during the first iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `val` has at least one tuple, and we can specify the state of `a3` and `l3` as the values of the first tuple in `val`.

State: **`val` contains at least one tuple, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` are the values of the first tuple in `val`**
