Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is set to `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `p1` is set to 1 and `p2` is set to 0 if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, otherwise `p1` is set to 0 and `p2` is set to 1. In both cases, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. If `idx1` >= 0 and `idx2` >= 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1` < 0 or `idx2` < 0, the program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
