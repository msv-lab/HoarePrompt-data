Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is set to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain as per the initial conditions, and no break occurs.***
