The code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` at the index `idx2` in the list `l1`. This means that the list `l1` will have one more element, and the elements after `idx2` will be shifted to the right.

Given the initial state, `l1` already has elements, and `a1` is an integer that is being inserted at the position `idx2`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Since `idx2` is the position where `a1` is being inserted, the list `l1` will now contain `a1` at that position, and all elements that were originally at `idx2` and after will be moved one position to the right. The list `l11`, which is derived from `l1` excluding `a2`, will also be affected because `a1` is being inserted into `l1`.

The lists `l2` and `l22` remain unchanged because the operation only affects `l1`. Similarly, the variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, and `val` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` and `a2` are the first integers from the new input lines; `l1` is the list with `a1` inserted at `idx2`; `l2` is unchanged; `l11` is derived from the updated `l1` excluding `a2`; `l22` is unchanged; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the mismatch involving `a1` and `a2` was found; `idx1` is greater than `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last mismatch involving `a1` and `a2`; `i` is the last index checked before breaking the loop; `val` is an empty list.**
