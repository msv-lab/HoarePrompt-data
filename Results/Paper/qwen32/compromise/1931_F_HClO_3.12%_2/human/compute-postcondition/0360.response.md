Postcondition: **`val` contains at least two tuples, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` are the values of the second tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
