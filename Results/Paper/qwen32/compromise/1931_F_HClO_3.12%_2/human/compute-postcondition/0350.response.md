The code snippet appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `val` initially includes the tuples `((a3, l3), (a3, l3))`, after appending `(a3, l3)`, `val` will now include three tuples: `((a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3))`. The variables `a3` and `l3` remain unchanged, and `m` is still incremented by 2, but since the increment operation is not part of the provided code snippet, we do not update `m` in this output state.

Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` includes the tuples `((a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3))`.**
