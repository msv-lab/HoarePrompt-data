The code snippet `val = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `val`. This means that the previous value of `val`, which was a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`), is replaced with an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is -1, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is an empty list.**
