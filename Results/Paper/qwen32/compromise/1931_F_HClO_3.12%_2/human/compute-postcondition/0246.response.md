The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` will read a line of input, split it into two parts, convert each part to an integer, and assign these integers to `n` and `m` respectively. 

Given the initial state, `n` and `m` were already defined, but their values were not specified. After executing the code, `n` and `m` will be updated to the values read from the input. 

The other variables (`t`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`)**.

In simpler terms, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers read from the input, while all other variables retain their previous values.
