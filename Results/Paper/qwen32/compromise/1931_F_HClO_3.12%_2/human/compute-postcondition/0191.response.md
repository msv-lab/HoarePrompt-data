Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is 3. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 3 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is 3 and `p2` is 1. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `p1`, `idx2`, and `p2` remain the same, except that the loop or if statement is terminated.
