Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least 3; `a1` and `a2` are the first integers from the new input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the same lines, with `l2` having `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise `l1` having `a1` inserted at `idx2` if certain conditions are met; `l11` and `l22` are lists derived from `l1` and `l2` excluding `a2` and `a1` respectively, reflecting any insertions; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the mismatch involving `a1` and `a2` was found; `idx1` is less than `idx2` if `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1`, otherwise `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last mismatch involving `a1` and `a2`; `i` is the last index checked before breaking the loop; `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l` is the list `l2` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise `l` is the list `l1` if `idx1 > idx2`, or a list with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `a1` comes before `a2` in `l3`.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least 3; `a1` and `a2` are the first integers from the new input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the same lines, with `l2` having `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise `l1` having `a1` inserted at `idx2` if certain conditions are met; `l11` and `l22` are lists derived from `l1` and `l2` excluding `a2` and `a1` respectively, reflecting any insertions; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the mismatch involving `a1` and `a2` was found; `idx1` is less than `idx2` if `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1`, otherwise `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last mismatch involving `a1` and `a2`; `i` is the last index checked before breaking the loop; `val` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l` is the list `l2` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise `l` is the list `l1` if `idx1 > idx2`, or a list with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `a1` comes before `a2` in `l3`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the loop has been broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least 3; `a1` and `a2` are the first integers from the new input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the same lines, with `l2` having `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise `l1` having `a1` inserted at `idx2` if certain conditions are met; `l11` and `l22` are lists derived from `l1` and `l2` excluding `a2` and `a1` respectively, reflecting any insertions; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the mismatch involving `a1` and `a2` was found; `idx1` is less than `idx2` if `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1`, otherwise `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last mismatch involving `a1` and `a2`; `i` is the last index checked before breaking the loop; `val` is a list containing tuples of the form `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l` is the list `l2` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise `l` is the list `l1` if `idx1 > idx2`, or a list with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `a1` comes before `a2` in `l3`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the loop has been broken out of; `(a3, l3)` is the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least 3; `a1` and `a2` are the first integers from the new input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the same lines, with `l2` having `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise `l1` having `a1` inserted at `idx2` if certain conditions are met; `l11` and `l22` are lists derived from `l1` and `l2` excluding `a2` and `a1` respectively, reflecting any insertions; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the mismatch involving `a1` and `a2` was found; `idx1` is less than `idx2` if `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1`, otherwise `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last mismatch involving `a1` and `a2`; `i` is the last index checked before breaking the loop; `val` is a list containing tuples of the form `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, and `val` has at least one more tuple `(a3, l3)` left to process; `(a3, l3)` is the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with `a3` removed, the loop is broken, and no further changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
