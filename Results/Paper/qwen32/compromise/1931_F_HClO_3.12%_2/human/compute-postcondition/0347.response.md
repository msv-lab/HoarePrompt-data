The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Therefore, `val` will now contain the original tuple `(a3, l3)` followed by the newly appended tuple `(a3, l3)`. The values of `a3`, `l3`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` includes the tuples `((a3, l3), (a3, l3)), `m` is incremented by 1.**
