The code snippet `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a tuple containing `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. This means that after executing this line, `val` will have an additional element which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` and `a2` are the first integers from the new input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the same lines, where `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1`; `l11` and `l22` are lists derived from `l1` and `l2` excluding `a2` and `a1` respectively; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the mismatch involving `a1` and `a2` was found; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last mismatch involving `a1` and `a2`; `i` is the last index checked before breaking the loop; `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; and `l` is a list with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `a1` comes before `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l` is equal to `l2`.**
