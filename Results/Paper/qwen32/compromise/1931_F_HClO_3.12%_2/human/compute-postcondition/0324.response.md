Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is -1, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `val` is an empty list, `l` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.**

In natural language: The variable `l` has been updated to be equal to `l1`, which is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
