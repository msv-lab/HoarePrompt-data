Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is 2, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but the values of all the variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
