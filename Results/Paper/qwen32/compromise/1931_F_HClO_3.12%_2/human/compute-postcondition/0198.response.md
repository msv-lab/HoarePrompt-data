The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` will insert the value of `a2` at the position `idx1` in the list `l2`. This means that `l2` will have one more element, and all elements at and after `idx1` will be shifted one position to the right.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list containing elements from the latest input with `a2` inserted at position `idx1`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values with `idx1` being less than `idx2`, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is an empty list`.**

In natural language: The list `l2` now includes the value `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`, shifting all subsequent elements one position to the right. All other variables retain their previous values.
