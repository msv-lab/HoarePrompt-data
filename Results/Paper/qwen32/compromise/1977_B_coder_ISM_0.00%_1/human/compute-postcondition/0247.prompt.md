Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < 2^30.
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    print(*s)
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `s` will have all `-1`s moved to the leftmost positions, followed by `0`s, and the rest of the elements will be either unchanged or `0`. The values of `t`, `x`, `flag`, and `length` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `s` has no consecutive `'-1'` and `'1'` pairs, and the variables `flag`, `length`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 29.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: s is a list of 30 or 31 elements following the specified rules, flag is 0 or 1, length is 30 or 31, t remains unchanged, nalla is incremented by 29 for each iteration, x is the input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
