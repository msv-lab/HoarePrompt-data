The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `s`. The values of `t` and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State includes `t` as an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 and `x` as an input integer, with `s` now being an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an empty list.**
