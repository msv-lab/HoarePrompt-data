The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `length`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `length` must be greater than 1.
- If `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i]` is '0' and `s[i - 1]` is '-1'. Otherwise, there is no change to `s[i]` or `s[i - 1]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has just completed its current iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `length` must be such that `i` is still less than `length`.

Since `i` was the loop variable in the previous iteration, it must have been in the range `[1, length - 1]`. After the loop body, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` from the previous iteration, and `length` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

Let's assume `i` was `k` in the previous iteration. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. For the loop to continue, `length` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`length` must be greater than `i + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` is now `i + 1` from the previous iteration, and `length` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`length` must be greater than `i`**.
