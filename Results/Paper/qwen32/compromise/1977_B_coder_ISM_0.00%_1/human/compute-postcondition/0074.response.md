The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` modifies the list `s` by setting the element at index `i - 1` to the string `'-1'`. The other variables remain unchanged unless directly affected by the code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `x` is an input integer
- `s` is a list of characters with a length of either 30 or 31 where `s[i]` is now '0'
- `flag` is 1 if it was 1 and `s[29]` was '0'; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged
- `length` is either 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag`
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- The element at index `i - 1` in the list `s` is set to `'-1'`. This means that the character at that position in the list `s` is now `'-1'` instead of `'0'`.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `flag`, `length`, and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters with a length of either 30 or 31 where `s[i - 1]` is now `'-1'` and all other elements are `'0'`; `flag` is 1 if it was 1 and `s[29]` was '0'; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged; `length` is either 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag`; `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**
