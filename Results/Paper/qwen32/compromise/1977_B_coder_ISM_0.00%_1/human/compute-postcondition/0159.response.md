The code snippet `s[i] = '0'` modifies the element at index `i` of the sequence `s` to be the string `'0'`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The precondition `length` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid as the code does not change the value of `length` or `i`.

Output State: **`length` must be greater than `i + 1`; `s[i]` is `'0'`.**
