Postcondition: **`s` contains 30 elements, each either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary digits of the input integer `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then `s[i]` is now '1' and `flag` is now 0. If `flag` was initially 0 and the original `s[0]` was '0', then `s[0]` is now '1'. If `flag` was initially 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and equal to `s[i + 1]`, then `s[i]` is now `'-1'` and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0, `length` remains 30, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29, `x` is the input integer, and `i` is 1. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'. If `flag` is 1, `s[i]` is `'-1'`.**
