Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters with a length of either 30 or 31. If `flag` is not 0, `s` has 31 characters with the last character `s[30]` being '1'. If `flag` is 0, `s` has 30 characters and `s[29]` remains unchanged; `length` is either 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag`; `flag` remains unchanged.**
