Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `length` remains unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 1. The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then `s[i]` is now '1'. If the condition `flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1')` is true, then `s[i]` is now `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains either 0 or 1, and the elements of `s` are unchanged except that if `flag` is 1, `s[i]` is specifically '0'.**
