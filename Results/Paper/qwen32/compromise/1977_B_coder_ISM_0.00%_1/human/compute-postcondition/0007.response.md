The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `s` will contain one element, which is the string `'1'`. The values of `t`, `x`, `length`, and the condition regarding the `i`-th bit of `x` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is `['1']`; `length` is 30. The `i`-th bit of `x` is set (i.e., `(x & pow(2, i))` is true).**
