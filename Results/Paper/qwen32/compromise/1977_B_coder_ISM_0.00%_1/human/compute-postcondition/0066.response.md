Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters with a length of either 30 or 31. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` was '0', `s` has 31 characters with `s[30]` being '1'. Otherwise, `s` has 30 characters and `s[29]` remains unchanged. `length` is either 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag`. `flag` is 1 if it was 1 and `s[29]` was '0'; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.**
