The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` modifies the list `s` by setting the element at index `i - 1` to the string `'-1'`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index `1` of the list `s` will be changed to `'-1'`. 

The initial state specifies that `s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements where the element at index 2 is `'0'`. After the code execution, the element at index 1 will be `'-1'`, and the element at index 2 will remain `'0'`.

No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements where the element at index 1 is `'-1'` and the element at index 2 is `'0'`, `flag` is 0 or 1, `length` is 30 or 31, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 2.**
