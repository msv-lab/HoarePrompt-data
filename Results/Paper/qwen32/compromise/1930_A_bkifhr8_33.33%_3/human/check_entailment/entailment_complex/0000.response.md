### Reasoning:

The provided code aims to solve the problem by reading multiple test cases, where each test case consists of 2n integers. The goal is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The code attempts to achieve this by reading the input, splitting it into a list, and then iterating through the list to compute the score.

However, there are several issues and inefficiencies in the code that could lead to incorrect results:

1. **Incorrect Pair Selection and Removal:**
   - The code attempts to remove elements from the list using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which is incorrect. These expressions always evaluate to `lst[0]` and `lst[0]` respectively, leading to incorrect element selection and potential errors if the list does not have enough elements.
   - The correct approach would be to sort the list and then sum up the elements at even indices, which represent the minimum values in each pair when the list is sorted.

2. **Handling of List Length:**
   - The code checks if the length of the list is not equal to 2, which is unnecessary and incorrect. The loop should simply iterate `n` times, each time taking the minimum of the first two elements of the list (after sorting).

3. **Loop Conditions:**
   - The loop condition and the break statement are not correctly structured. The loop should iterate exactly `n` times, and there is no need to check the length of the list inside the loop.

4. **Sorting and Pairing:**
   - The optimal strategy is to sort the list and then sum the first `n` elements (which are the minimums of each pair when the list is sorted).

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        for j in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[j]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the original code, it is not correct. The provided code does not correctly implement the strategy to find the maximum score by optimally pairing the integers.

**Correctness: False**
