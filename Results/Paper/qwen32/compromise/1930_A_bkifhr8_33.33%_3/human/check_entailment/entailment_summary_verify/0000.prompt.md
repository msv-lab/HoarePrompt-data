You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of pairs of integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values from each pair and outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the maximum final score as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not sort the list of integers before processing them, which is necessary to ensure that the smallest possible integers are paired together to maximize the score.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Sorting**: The program does not sort the list of integers. To maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest available integers. Sorting the list ensures that the smallest integers are considered first.

2. **Incorrect Pairing Logic**: The program attempts to remove elements from the list using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which is incorrect. The `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` expressions always evaluate to `0` and `2`, respectively, and this is not the intended behavior. Instead, it should remove the first two elements of the list after sorting.

3. **Handling of Input**: The program reads the input as a string and splits it into a list of strings. It then converts these strings to integers when needed. This part is correct, but it should be followed by sorting the list.

4. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is incorrect. The loop should continue until all elements are processed, not just until the list has two elements left. The `else` block is also redundant because the loop will naturally terminate after processing all elements.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split(' ')))
        lst.sort()
        for i in range(0, n * 2, 2):
            ans += lst[i]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example usage
# func()
```

In the corrected version, the list is sorted, and the program pairs the smallest integers by iterating over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair to the score. This ensures that the score is maximized.
