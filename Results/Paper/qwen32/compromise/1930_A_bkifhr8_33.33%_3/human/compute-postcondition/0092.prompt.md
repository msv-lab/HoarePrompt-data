Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `ans_f` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    ans = 0
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = l.split(' ')
    for i in range(n * 2):
        if len(lst) != 2:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
            lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
        else:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            break
    ans_f.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the input string, `lst` is either empty or has fewer than two elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is the sum of the minimums of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` has 2 or fewer elements, `i` is `n * 2 - 1` if the loop executed all iterations without breaking early.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` three times, `ans` is the accumulated sum of the minimum values from the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration until `lst` had exactly 2 elements, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list with 2 or fewer elements, and `i` is `n * 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
