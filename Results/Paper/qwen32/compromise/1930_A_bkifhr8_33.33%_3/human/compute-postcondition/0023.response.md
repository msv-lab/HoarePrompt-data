The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `n * 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 5. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, `i` is 5**
