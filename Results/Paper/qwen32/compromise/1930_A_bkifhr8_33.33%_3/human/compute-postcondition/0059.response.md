Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, and `i` is 2. If `len(lst)` is not equal to 2, `ans` is three times the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and `lst` has its first and third elements removed. If `len(lst)` is equal to 2, `ans` is its previous value plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
