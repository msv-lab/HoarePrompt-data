The given code snippet assigns a specific value to the variable `check`. The value assigned is `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is a constant value. This operation does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `check` is 2147483647.**
