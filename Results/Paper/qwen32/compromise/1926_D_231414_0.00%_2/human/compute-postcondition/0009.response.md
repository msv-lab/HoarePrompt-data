The given code snippet is:

```python
s = i ^ check
```

Here, `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means the code would raise a `NameError` because `i` is used without being initialized. However, assuming `i` was intended to be part of the initial state or was previously defined in a context not provided here, let's proceed with the assumption that `i` is a known integer.

Given the initial state, the only variable affected by the code is `s`. The value of `s` is calculated as the bitwise XOR (`^`) of `i` and `check`.

Output State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31; `check` is 2147483647; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one element; `dic` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is `n`; `s` is `i ^ 2147483647`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `times` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` remains the input integer, the list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains unchanged, `check` remains 2147483647, `data` remains the list of integers from the input, `dic` remains an empty dictionary, `ans` remains `n`, and `s` is now the result of `i` XOR 2147483647.
