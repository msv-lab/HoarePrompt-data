Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, which is a list of integers where each integer `x` is between 2 and 1000. The function processes each `x` in `test_cases` to determine the value of `y` that maximizes a certain sum for each `x`. It returns a list `results` containing the value of `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`.**
