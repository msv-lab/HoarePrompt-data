The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over `y` starting from `x - 1` down to `1`. If the loop has just finished an iteration, `y` would have been decremented by `1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `y` is the value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, or the value where the loop broke. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by `1` and still be greater than or equal to `1`.

Let's assume that the loop just finished an iteration with the current value of `y`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be `y - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for the last `x` processed, `x` remains `next_x` (the next element in `test_cases`), `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, no updates are made to `max_sum` or `best_y`.**
