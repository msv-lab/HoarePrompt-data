The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y`. The loop iterates from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `y` by `1` in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by `1` to the next value in the range, which is `1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `best_y` is 2, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 2, `current_sum` is 4, `max_sum` is 4**
