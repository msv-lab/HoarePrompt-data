Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `best_y` is 1, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all the variable values remain the same as in the initial state.
