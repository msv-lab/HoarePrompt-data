The code snippet appends the value of `best_y` to the `results` list. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` remain unchanged. The only change is that `results`, which was initially an empty list, now contains the value of `best_y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is the maximum `current_sum` found across all `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the `y` that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed.**
