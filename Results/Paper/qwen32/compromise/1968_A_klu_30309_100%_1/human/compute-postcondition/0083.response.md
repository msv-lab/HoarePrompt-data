Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing the value of `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`. Each `best_y` is the value of `y` that gave the maximum sum for the corresponding `x` processed.**

This means that `results` is a list where each element is the optimal `y` value that produced the highest `current_sum` for each `x` in the `test_cases` list.
