The code snippet calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` and assigns it to `gcd_val`. Since `y` is not defined in the initial state, we will assume that `y` is a variable that should be defined or is part of a loop where it takes on different values. For the purpose of this task, we will consider `y` as a given integer, and we will include it in the output state.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000
- `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`
- `max_sum` is 0
- `best_y` is 1
- `x` is the next element in `test_cases`

The code snippet `gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)` calculates the GCD of `x` and `y` and assigns it to `gcd_val`. Since `y` is not specified in the initial state, we will assume `y` is a predefined integer for the purpose of this task.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is a predefined integer, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`**.
