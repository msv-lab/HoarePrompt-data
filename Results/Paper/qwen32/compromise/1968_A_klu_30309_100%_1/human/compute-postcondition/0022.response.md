The value of `max_sum` is updated to be equal to `current_sum`. Since `current_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is also set to 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `best_y` is 2, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2**
