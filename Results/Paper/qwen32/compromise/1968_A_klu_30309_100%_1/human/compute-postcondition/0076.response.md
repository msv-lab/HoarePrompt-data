The code snippet provided updates `max_sum` to the value of `current_sum`. This means that `max_sum` will now hold the value that `current_sum` held before the assignment. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= `x` <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for the last `x` processed, `x` remains `next_x` (the next element in `test_cases`), `y` is `y + 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `current_sum`. If `current_sum` is greater than the previous `max_sum`, then `best_y` is updated to `y`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no updates are made to `best_y`.**
