The code snippet assigns `current_sum` the value of `gcd_val + y`. Given that `gcd_val` is 2 and `y` is 2, `current_sum` becomes `2 + 2`, which equals 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `best_y` is 1, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `gcd_val` is 2, and the condition for updating `max_sum` remains valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `best_y` is 1, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `gcd_val` is 2, `current_sum` is 4, and `max_sum` remains unchanged if `current_sum` was not greater than `max_sum`.**
