The code snippet assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`. Given that `y` is 2, `best_y` will also be 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `best_y` is 2, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `gcd_val` is 2, `current_sum` is 4, `max_sum` is 4.**
