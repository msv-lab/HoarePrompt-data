The code snippet provided recalculates the value of `p2` using the same formula that was already used to initialize it. Since the formula and the input values (`coord[3][0]`, `coord[3][1]`, `coord[2][0]`, `coord[2][1]`) have not changed, the value of `p2` remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a sorted list of [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `p1` is (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2; `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2.**
