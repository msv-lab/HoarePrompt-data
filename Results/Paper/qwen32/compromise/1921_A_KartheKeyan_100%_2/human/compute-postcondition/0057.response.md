Let's break down the given initial state and calculate the value that will be printed.

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.)
   - `n` is a non-zero integer. (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.)
   - `coord` is a sorted list of four tuples representing coordinates: [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)].
   - `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   - `i` is 3. (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.)
   - `p1` is calculated as the squared distance between the first two points in `coord`: \((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2\).
   - `p2` is calculated as the squared distance between the last two points in `coord`: \((x_4 - x_3)^2 + (y_4 - y_3)^2\).

2. **Calculations:**
   - `p1` is \((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\).
   - `p2` is \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\).
   - `res` is \(\sqrt{p1} \times \sqrt{p2}\).

3. **Final Calculation for `res`:**
   - Since `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, it simplifies to \(\sqrt{p1 \times p2}\).

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(round(res))`, which means the final result will be the rounded value of `res`.

Given the above steps, the output will be the rounded value of \(\sqrt{p1 \times p2}\), where `p1` and `p2` are the squared distances calculated from the coordinates in the `coord` list.

Since the exact values of the coordinates in `coord` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the output. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **rounded value of \(\sqrt{p1 \times p2}\) (where \(p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\) and \(p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\))**
