Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is [(x, y)]; `res` is 0; `i` is 0; `p1` is \((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\) if `coord` had at least 2 elements before, otherwise `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` is \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\) if `coord` had at least 4 elements before, otherwise `p2` remains unchanged; `x` and `y` are the new input integers.**

Natural Language: The `coord` list now contains one tuple `(x, y)`. All other variables remain unchanged unless `coord` previously had at least 2 or 4 elements, in which case `p1` and `p2` would be recalculated accordingly.
