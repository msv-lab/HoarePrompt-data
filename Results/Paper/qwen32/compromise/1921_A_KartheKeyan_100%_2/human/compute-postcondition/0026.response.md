Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 0; `p1` is undefined; `p2` is undefined; `x` is the first input integer; `y` is the second input integer.**

The list `coord` now contains one tuple, which is the pair `(x, y)` formed from the first and second input integers. All other variables retain their initial values.
