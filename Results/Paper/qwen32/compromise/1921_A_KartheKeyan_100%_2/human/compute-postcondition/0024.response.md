The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is used in the `range(4)` function. The loop will execute as long as the range is valid, meaning `i` should start from 0 (as `range(4)` generates numbers from 0 to 3).

Given the initial state, `i` is set to 3, which is the last iteration of the loop. If we want the loop to execute from the beginning, `i` should be set to 0 before the loop starts. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, `p1`, `p2`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is 0; `i` is 0; `p1` is \((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\); `p2` is \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\)**

However, since `coord` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` cannot be computed as they depend on elements in `coord`. To ensure the loop can execute without errors, `coord` should be initialized with at least 4 elements if `p1` and `p2` need to be valid. But strictly adhering to the task requirement to only adjust objects in the loop head, we will not change `coord`.

Final adjusted state considering only the loop head variables:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is 0; `i` is 0; `p1` is \((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\); `p2` is \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\)**
