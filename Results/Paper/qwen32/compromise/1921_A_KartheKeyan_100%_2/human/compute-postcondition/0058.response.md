Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer minus 1; `coord` is a sorted list of [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]; `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`; `i` is 3; `p1` is (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2; `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2.**

In simpler terms, the Output State is: `t` remains the same integer between 1 and 100; `n` is decreased by 1; `coord` remains the same sorted list of coordinate tuples; `res` remains the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`; `i` remains 3; `p1` and `p2` remain the same calculated values based on the differences in coordinates.
