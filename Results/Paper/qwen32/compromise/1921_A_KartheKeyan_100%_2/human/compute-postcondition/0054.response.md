Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a sorted list of [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `p1` is (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2; `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2.**

Explanation: The value of `p1` is recalculated using the formula `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2`, but since it was already initialized with the same value, the value of `p1` remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, and `p2`) remain unchanged.
