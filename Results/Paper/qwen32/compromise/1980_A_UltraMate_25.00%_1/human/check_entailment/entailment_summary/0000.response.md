### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the number of rounds `m`, and the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Existing Problems:**
   - It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems:**
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the string `p = 'ABCDEF'` which represents the required difficulty levels.
     - If a difficulty level `i` from `p` is not present in the `hmp` (the counter of existing problems), it adds `m` to `ans` because `m` rounds require `m` problems of that difficulty level.
     - If a difficulty level `i` is present but its count is less than `m`, it adds the difference `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the calculated `ans`, which is the minimum number of additional problems needed.

### Issues:
- The program does not account for the difficulty level 'G'. According to the problem statement, each round should contain problems of difficulty levels 'A' through 'G', but the program only considers 'A' through 'F'.
- Therefore, if there are not enough problems of difficulty 'G', the program will not add the necessary count to `ans`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it fails to consider the difficulty level 'G'. It only checks for 'A' through 'F', which means it might undercount the number of additional problems needed.

### Correctness: **False**
