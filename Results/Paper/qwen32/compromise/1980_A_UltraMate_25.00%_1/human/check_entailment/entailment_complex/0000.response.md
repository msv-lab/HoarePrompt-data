### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the string `a` which represents the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `a`.

3. **Calculating Minimum Additions:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the string `'ABCDEF'` (ignoring 'G') and checks if each difficulty level is present in the counter `hmp`.
     - If a difficulty level is not present (`if i not in hmp`), it adds `m` to `ans` because Vlad needs `m` problems of that difficulty level.
     - If a difficulty level is present but its count is less than `m` (`if hmp[i] < m`), it adds the difference `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans` to make sure there are at least `m` problems of that difficulty level.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles cases where some difficulty levels are missing entirely (`if i not in hmp`) and cases where the count of a difficulty level is less than `m` (`if hmp[i] < m`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case, as specified in the problem statement.

### Comparison with Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10 1 BGECDCBDED`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Vlad needs 1 problem of difficulty 'A' and 1 problem of difficulty 'F'. Thus, the output is `2`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `10 2 BGECDCBDED`
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: Vlad needs 2 problems each of difficulty 'A', 'F', and 'G'. Since 'G' is not present, he needs 2 for 'G'. He also needs 2 for 'A' and 2 for 'F'. Thus, the output is `5`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `9 1 BBCDEFFGG`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Vlad needs 1 problem of difficulty 'A'. Thus, the output is `1`.

The program correctly computes the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as per the given problem description and examples.

**Correctness: True**
