Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in the non-empty string `s`. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is `4 * m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `3 * m`.**
