Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is the string from the input, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is `'F'`. If `'F'` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is `2 * m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `0`.**
