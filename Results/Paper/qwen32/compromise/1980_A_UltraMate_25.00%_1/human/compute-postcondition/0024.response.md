Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `s` is a string input by the user that must contain at least one character; `p` is 'ABCDEF'; `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` and must have at least one key. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current key.**
