The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This means that the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state, `n` and `m` already have values (where `n` is the first integer from the input and `m` is the second integer from the input). After executing the code snippet, these values will be overwritten with the new integers read from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `s` is the string from the input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `ans` is 4 * `m` + sum(`m` - `hmp[i]` for `i` in `hmp` if `hmp[i]` < `m`)**.
