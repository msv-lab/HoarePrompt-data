Precondition: **The function takes no explicit input arguments. However, it is expected to read input from standard input where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell, respectively.**
