Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case is described by three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of all n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.**
