Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value and `lst[x]` includes at least one element, `_` is incremented to `x-1`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each iteration, `s` is True
Code of the loop:
while lst[x]:
    y = lst[x].pop()
    if lst[y] != []:
        x = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value, `_` is incremented to `x-1`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each iteration, `s` is True. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, `x` is set to `y` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no changes occur to `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` after the pop operation, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after the pop operation, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value, `_` is incremented to `x-1`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each iteration, `s` is True. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value and `lst[x]` contains one less element than before, `_` is incremented to `x-1`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each iteration, `s` is True. If `lst[y]` is not empty, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
