Output State: **`lst[x]` is empty, `x` is a leaf node, `y` is the last element popped from `lst[x]` in the last iteration, `_` has been incremented 3 times, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each iteration, `s` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been toggled from `True` to `False` by the operation `s = not s`. All other variables retain their initial state values.
