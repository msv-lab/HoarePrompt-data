Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: 
Code of the loop:
while lst[x]:
    y = lst[x].pop()
    if lst[y] != []:
        x = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lst` is `[[1, 2], ...]`, `y` is 3. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, then `x` is 3. Otherwise, `x` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `lst` is `[[1, 2], ..., [non-empty list except the last element if it was at index 3], ...]`; `y` is the last element of `lst[3]` before it was removed; `x` is 3. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, then the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `lst` is `[[1, 2], ..., [non-empty list except the last element has been removed from lst[3]], ...]`; `y` is the last element of the original `lst[3]`; if `lst[y]` is not an empty list, then `x` is equal to `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to `x`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
