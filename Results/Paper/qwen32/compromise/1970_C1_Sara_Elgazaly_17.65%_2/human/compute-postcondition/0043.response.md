The value of `y` is updated to the last element of the list at index `x` in `lst`, and that element is then removed from the list. Given that `x` is 3, `y` will be the last element of `lst[3]`, and this element will be removed from `lst[3]`.

Output State: **`lst` is `[[1, 2], ..., [non-empty list except the last element if it was at index 3], ...]`; `y` is the last element of `lst[3]` before it was removed; `x` is 3.**
