The code snippet `y = lst[x].pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `lst[x]`. Given that `lst[x]` must not be empty, the last element is assigned to `y`, and the list `lst[x]` is modified by losing that last element.

Output State: **`lst[x]` is a list with its last element removed, `y` is the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`**.
