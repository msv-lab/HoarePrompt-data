### Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem by distributing the bets in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. Here's how the program works:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **LCM Calculation**: The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k` by multiplying them all together. This is stored in the variable `m`.

3. **Bet Calculation**: For each outcome, it calculates a bet `c[i]` as `m / k[i]`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome is the winning one, the returned amount will be `k[i] * c[i] = m`, which is the LCM of all multipliers. The idea here is to make sure that the total bet is less than `m` so that for any winning outcome, the returned amount is strictly greater than the total bet.

4. **Simplification**: The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the calculated bets `c` and divides each bet by this GCD to simplify the bets. This step is not strictly necessary for the correctness of the solution but it ensures that the bets are as small as possible while maintaining the required property.

5. **Validation**: The program checks if the sum of the simplified bets is less than `m / hcf` (which should be equal to the sum of the original bets divided by the GCD). If this condition is not met, it outputs `-1` indicating that no valid distribution of bets is possible. Otherwise, it prints the simplified bets.

6. **Output**: The bets are printed in the required format.

### Analysis:

The logic of the program is correct. It ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome by leveraging the LCM and GCD calculations. If the sum of the simplified bets is not less than `m / hcf`, it correctly identifies that no valid distribution of bets is possible and outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.
