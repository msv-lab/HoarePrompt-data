Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating a set of bets based on the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD) of the multipliers. However, the logic used does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Calculate the LCM (`m`)**:
   ```python
   m = 1
   for i in range(n):
       m = m * k[i]
   ```
   This calculates the product of all `k_i` values, which is not necessarily the LCM. The LCM should be calculated using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = abs(a*b) // GCD(a, b)`. The current implementation simply multiplies all `k_i` values together, which is incorrect for calculating the LCM.

2. **Calculate the bets (`c`)**:
   ```python
   c = []
   for i in range(n):
       c.append(int(m / k[i]))
   ```
   Here, the bets are calculated as `m / k_i`, which is incorrect if `m` is not the LCM. Additionally, these bets are not guaranteed to be integers if `m` is not the LCM.

3. **Calculate the GCD of the bets (`hcf`)**:
   ```python
   hcf = func_1(c)
   for i in range(n):
       c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf)
   ```
   The GCD is calculated and used to normalize the bets. However, this step does not ensure that the total bets are less than the received amount for each outcome.

4. **Check if the total bets are less than the received amount**:
   ```python
   if sum(c) >= m / hcf:
       print(-1)
   else:
       for i in range(n):
           print(c[i], end=' ')
       print('')
   ```
   The check `sum(c) >= m / hcf` is incorrect because `m / hcf` is not the correct value to compare against. The correct comparison should be against the received amount for each outcome, which is `k_i * x_i`.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
2 3 4
```

The program will calculate:
- `m = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24`
- `c = [24/2, 24/3, 24/4] = [12, 8, 6]`
- `hcf = GCD(12, 8, 6) = 2`
- `c = [12/2, 8/2, 6/2] = [6, 4, 3]`
- `sum(c) = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13`
- `m / hcf = 24 / 2 = 12`

Since `sum(c) >= m / hcf`, the program will output `-1`, which is incorrect. The correct bets should be `[1, 1, 1]`, which sums to `3` and is less than `2 * 1`, `3 * 1`, and `4 * 1`.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
