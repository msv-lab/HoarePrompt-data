Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. The first integer `t` in the list represents the number of test cases. Following `t`, there are `t` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains `n` integers representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome is winning. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list `numbers`.**
