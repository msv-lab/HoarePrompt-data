To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n` in this case.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` has a new element which is `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` appended to it.

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Let's break down the state adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used to append a new element to `a`. The loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
2. **Variable `n`:** The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the next iteration to execute, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration `i` was some value, let's denote that value as `i_prev`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i_prev + 1`. However, we know that `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

So, if at the end of the last iteration `i` was `i_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` will be `i_prev + 1`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `a` has a new element which is `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` appended to it.**

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we can simplify this to:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`.**
