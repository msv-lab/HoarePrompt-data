Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains the same input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4; `n` remains the same input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `x` remains the same list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` remains the same list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`; `a` remains a list containing the elements `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]]`; `result` is a string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t + (n - 1)`, `n` remains the same input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` remains the same list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[i-1]]` for all 1 <= i <= n-1, `result` is a string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces, `line` is the input string.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list with `n` elements where the first element is `1000` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of `1000` and the elements of `T` up to that point; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a` converted to strings.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
