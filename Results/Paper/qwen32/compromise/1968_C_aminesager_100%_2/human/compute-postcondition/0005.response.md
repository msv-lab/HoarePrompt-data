The code snippet converts the string `line` into a list of integers and assigns this list to the variable `T`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`.**
