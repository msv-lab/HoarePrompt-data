The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`, and `a` has a new element appended which is `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`. Since `i_prev` was less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, `i_prev + 1` must also be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 1`**

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can express the state in terms of the relationship between `i` and `n`:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`**
