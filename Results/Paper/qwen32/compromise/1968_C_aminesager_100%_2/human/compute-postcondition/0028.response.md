Output State: **`t` is `t + (n - 1)`, `n` remains the same input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` remains the same list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[i-1]]` for all 1 <= i <= n-1, `result` is a string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces, `line` is the input string.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will have increased by `n - 1` from its initial value. The variables `n`, `x`, `T`, and `line` will remain unchanged. The list `a` will contain `n` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the previous elements in `T` starting from 1000. The `result` will be a string representation of the list `a` with its elements separated by spaces.
