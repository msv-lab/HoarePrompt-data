`s` is assigned the sum of the integers in the `elements` list. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `pos` remain unchanged. The state of `elements` is also not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`). `elements` is a list of integers. `pos` is an empty list. `s` is the sum of the integers in `elements`.**
