You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `tests` is an input integer, and the loop has executed `tests` times. After each iteration, if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `c` contains at least one character not present in either `a` or `b`, the output is 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three strings of equal length. For each test case, it determines if the third string contains at least one character not present in either of the first two strings. If such a character exists, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Let's analyze why this is the case.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Check for Matching Template:**
   - The program checks if `c == a` or `c == b` and immediately prints 'NO' if true. This is not the correct logic. The template can still exist even if `c` is equal to `a` or `b` as long as there is at least one position where `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not.
   
2. **Logic for Finding Template:**
   - The program checks if any character in `c` is not in `a` and not in `b` and prints 'YES' if such a character exists. This is also incorrect. The template can match `a` and `b` while not matching `c` even if all characters of `c` are present in `a` and `b`. The correct approach is to check each position and see if a template can be constructed that satisfies the conditions for all positions.

### Correct Approach:
- For each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
  - If `a[i] == b[i]`, then the template at position `i` must be an uppercase letter that is not equal to `a[i]`.
  - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then the template at position `i` can be either `a[i]` (lowercase) or `b[i]` (lowercase).
- Check if the constructed template does not match `c` at any position.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
2
ab
ba
aa
```
Expected Output: `YES`
Explanation: Template "Ab" can be used. Here, 'A' (uppercase) means it should be different from 'a' in `c`, and 'b' (lowercase) means it should be the same as 'b' in `c`.

However, the provided program would print `NO` because it incorrectly checks the presence of characters in `c` without constructing the correct template.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
