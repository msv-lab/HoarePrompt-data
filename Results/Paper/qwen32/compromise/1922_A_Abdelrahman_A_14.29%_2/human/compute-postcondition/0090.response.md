Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `tests` is an input integer, and the loop has executed `tests` times. After each iteration, if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `c` contains at least one character not present in either `a` or `b`, the output is 'YES'.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have processed `tests` number of sets of strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each set, it will have printed 'NO' if `c` is the same as `a` or `b`, and 'YES' if `c` contains at least one character that is not in `a` or `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged unless modified by user input within the loop.
