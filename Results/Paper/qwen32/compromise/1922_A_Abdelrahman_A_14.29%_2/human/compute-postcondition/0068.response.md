The print statement in the given code snippet is `print('NO')`. This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `slength`, `tests`, `i`, `no`). The precondition does not affect the output of this specific print statement because it is printing a fixed string.

Thus, the output of the print statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
