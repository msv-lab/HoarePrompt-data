Postcondition: **`c` is a string with at least one character, `x` is the next character in the string `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, then `no` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `no` and the loop remains unchanged.**
