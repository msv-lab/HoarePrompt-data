The initial state describes the variable `c` as a string with at least two characters and `x` as the next character in the string `c`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('YES')`, which is a literal string and does not depend on the values of `c` or `x`.

Therefore, the output will be the literal string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
