Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the input string provided by the user, `c` is the new input string provided by the user, `slength` is the new input integer, `tests` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `no` is True, then `c` contains at least one character not present in either `a` or `b`, or `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`.**
