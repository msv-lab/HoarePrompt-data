Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the resulting array after `k` such operations and output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Observations
1. **Subarray Selection**: The optimal strategy involves selecting the subarray with the maximum sum, as inserting larger sums will yield a higher overall sum.
2. **Empty Subarray**: Inserting the sum of an empty subarray (which is 0) does not change the sum of the array.
3. **Maximizing the Sum**: The maximum possible sum of any contiguous subarray can be found using Kadane's algorithm.
4. **Repetitive Insertion**: The maximum sum subarray can be inserted multiple times to maximize the overall sum. Inserting the maximum sum subarray `k` times will result in a sum of `k * max_sum`.

### Correctness of the Provided Solution
Let's examine the provided solution:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        c = 0
        maxi = 0
        for ele in l:
            if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
                c = 0
            else:
                c += ele
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

#### Issues in the Solution
1. **Incorrect Application of Kadane's Algorithm**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly implement Kadane's algorithm. Kadane's algorithm involves maintaining a running sum of the current subarray and resetting it if it becomes negative, while keeping track of the maximum sum found so far.
   - The provided solution incorrectly handles the condition `if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele)`, which does not align with Kadane's algorithm logic.
   
2. **Incorrect Formula for Maximum Sum**:
   - The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum after `k` operations.
   - The correct approach would be to add the maximum subarray sum `maxi` to the sum of the array `sum(l)` for each of the `k` operations, resulting in `sum(l) + k * maxi`.

### Correct Solution
A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray using Kadane's algorithm
        max_sum = float('-inf')
        current_sum = 0
        for num in l:
            current_sum += num
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
            if current_sum < 0:
                current_sum = 0
        
        # The maximum possible sum after k operations
        total_sum = sum(l) + k * max_sum
        
        # Output the result modulo 10^9 + 7
        print(total_sum % 1000000007)

func()
```

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the provided solution, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
