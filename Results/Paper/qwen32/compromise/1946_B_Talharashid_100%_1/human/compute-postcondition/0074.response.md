Postcondition: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is set to `'ele'` and `maxi` is set to `'ele'`.**
