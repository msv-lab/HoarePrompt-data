The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `c`, `maxi`, and `i` are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `l`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
