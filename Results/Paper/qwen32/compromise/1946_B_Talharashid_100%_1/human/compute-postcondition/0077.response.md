The code snippet provided is `c = 0`, which reassigns the value of `c` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`.**
