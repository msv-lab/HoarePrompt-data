The code snippet updates the variable `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and the current value of `maxi`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet provided. The value of `c` is also not changed by this snippet, but it is used in the calculation of `maxi`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` is increased by `ele`, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
