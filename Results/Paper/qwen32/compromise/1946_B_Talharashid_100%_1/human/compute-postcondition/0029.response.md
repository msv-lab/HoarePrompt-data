The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This does not affect the variables `c`, `maxi`, or `i` which were mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `c`, `maxi`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers in `l` (or 0 if the last element in `l` is negative and `c` was reset); `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input.**
