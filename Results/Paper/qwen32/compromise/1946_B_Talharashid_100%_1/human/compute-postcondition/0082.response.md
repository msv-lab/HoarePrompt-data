The code snippet updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current values of `c` and `maxi`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers (or 0 if the final element resets `c`); `maxi` is the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `l` is the list of integers from the input.**
