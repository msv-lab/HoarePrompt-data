Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` is updated to be `c + ele`, `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**

Natural language: The value of `c` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and `ele`. The value of `maxi` has been updated to be the maximum of the new value of `c` and its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
