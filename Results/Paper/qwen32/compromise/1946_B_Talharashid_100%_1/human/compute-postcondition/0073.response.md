The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` compares the current value of `c` with `maxi` and assigns the larger value to `maxi`. Given that `c` is the string `'ele'` and `maxi` is `0`, the comparison will result in `maxi` being updated to `'ele'` because strings are compared lexicographically and any string is considered greater than an integer in Python.

Output State: **`c` is `'ele'`, `maxi` is `'ele'`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements.**
