The only variable in the loop head is `ele`, which is an element that will be iterated over from the list `l`. The loop will execute if the list `l` has at least one element. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `l` is a list with at least one integer.

The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `maxi` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be directly adjusted to affect the loop execution. However, the state of `l` needs to be such that the loop can iterate over at least one element.

Given the requirement, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `l` has at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer; `c` is 0; `maxi` is 0**
