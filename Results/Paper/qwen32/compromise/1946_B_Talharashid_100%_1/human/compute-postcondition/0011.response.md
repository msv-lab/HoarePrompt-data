The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, and the precondition regarding `ele` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer; `c` is the previous value of `c` plus `ele`; `maxi` is the maximum of the previous value of `maxi` and `c`. Either `ele` is not less than 0, or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`.**
