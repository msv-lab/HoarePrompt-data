The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. This means that `l` will now hold the list of integers provided in the input.

The other variables (`c`, `maxi`, `i`, `n`, and `k`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `l`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
