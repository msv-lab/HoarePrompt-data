To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given code and the initial state.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `c` is initialized to 0.
   - `maxi` is initialized to 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the loop).
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
   - `l` is a list of integers read from the input.

2. **Loop Body**:
   - For each element `ele` in the list `l`:
     - If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`:
       - `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and the current `maxi`.
       - `c` is reset to 0.
     - Otherwise:
       - `c` is updated to `c + ele`.
       - `maxi` is updated to the maximum of the updated `c` and the current `maxi`.

### Final Output State:
- The loop iterates through each element in the list `l`.
- `c` accumulates the sum of elements until it encounters a negative element that is greater than or equal to the current `c`. At that point, `c` is reset to 0, and `maxi` is updated if the current `c` is greater than the previous `maxi`.
- After all iterations, `maxi` will hold the maximum value of `c` encountered during the loop, which represents the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `l`.

### Conclusion:
- `c` will be 0 at the end of the loop because the loop resets `c` to 0 whenever a qualifying negative number is encountered, and after processing all elements, no further accumulation occurs.
- `maxi` will hold the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `l`.

Given the above analysis, the final output state is:

Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `l`.**
