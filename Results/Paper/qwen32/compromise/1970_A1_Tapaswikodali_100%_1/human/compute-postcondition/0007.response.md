To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the sequence of events and the values of the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of "(" and ")".
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for elements with the same balance.
   - `balance` is initialized to 0.
   - `result` is a string formed by joining the characters from `balance_info` in the specified order.

2. **Understanding `balance_info`:**
   - `balance_info` is a list of objects, each representing a character in the string `s` along with its cumulative balance at that position.
   - The cumulative balance at any position is calculated by adding 1 for each "(" and subtracting 1 for each ")" encountered up to that position.
   - `balance_info` is sorted such that:
     - The objects are sorted by their cumulative balance in ascending order.
     - For objects with the same cumulative balance, they are sorted by their position in the string `s` in descending order.

3. **Forming `result`:**
   - `result` is formed by concatenating the characters from `balance_info` in the order they appear in the sorted list.
   - Because `balance_info` is sorted by balance and position as specified, the characters in `result` will be rearranged based on these criteria.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result` which is a rearrangement of the characters in the original string `s` based on the specified sorting criteria of `balance_info`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the string `result`, which is a rearrangement of the characters in the original string `s` sorted by the cumulative balance and position as described.

Output: **result (where result is the string formed by concatenating characters from balance_info sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for elements with the same balance)**
