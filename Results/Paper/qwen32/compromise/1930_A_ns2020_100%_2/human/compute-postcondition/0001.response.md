To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` in the loop head. The loop condition is `while t:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is assigned the value of the first integer input, which is the number of test cases.
- The value of `t` is between 1 and 5000, inclusive.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 5000, it is already greater than 0, which means the loop condition `while t:` will be true, and the loop can certainly execute one time.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the state of `t` to ensure the loop executes the first time.

State: **`t` is assigned the value of the first integer input (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000), and the second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) which are the numbers written on the whiteboard.**
