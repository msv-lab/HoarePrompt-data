### Reasoning:
The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of finding two different elements within a specified subarray for each query. However, upon careful analysis, it appears that the logic within the `func_1` function is flawed and does not correctly handle all possible scenarios.

Here are the key issues with the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Use of `bisect_left`**: The `bisect_left` function is used to find the first segment that starts at or after the left boundary `l` of the query. However, the comparison `(l, 0, 0)` is incorrect because the third element of the tuple in `arr` is a number from the array, not a zero. This could lead to incorrect segment selection.

2. **Incorrect Segment Handling**: The logic for handling the segments identified by `bisect_left` is flawed. Specifically, the conditions to determine whether a valid pair exists are not correctly implemented. For example, the condition `if s > l` and subsequent checks do not correctly cover all cases where a valid pair might exist.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The code does not correctly handle edge cases where the subarray contains only one unique element or where the subarray is very small.

4. **Incorrect Output Logic**: The output logic is flawed. For example, the condition `if s == 1 or s > r` is incorrect because `s` being 1 does not necessarily mean that no valid pair exists. Similarly, the conditions `elif e >= r` and `elif e < N or e < l` do not correctly determine the existence of a valid pair.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the provided program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
