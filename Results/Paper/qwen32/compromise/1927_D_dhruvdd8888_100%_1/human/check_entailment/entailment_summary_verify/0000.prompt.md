You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `nums`. It then processes a series of queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, it determines and prints a pair of indices `(s, e + 1)` based on the segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`. If no valid segment is found, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all the cases as per the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts within the query range `[l, r]`. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the queried segment might span multiple segments in the `arr` list.
   - The logic for checking if a valid pair exists within the queried range `[l, r]` is flawed. Specifically, it does not correctly address scenarios where the queried range might contain more than one segment of different elements.

2. **Incorrect Pair Selection**:
   - The program selects pairs based on the start and end of segments but does not ensure that these pairs are within the queried range `[l, r]`.
   - For example, if the segment starts before `l` and ends after `r`, the program might incorrectly print indices outside the queried range.

3. **Handling of Single Element Segments**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the queried range `[l, r]` contains only one segment of elements. In such cases, it should return `-1 -1` as no distinct pair exists.

Here is a specific counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might output something different, especially for the second query `[1, 2]`, where it should return `-1 -1` since all elements in the range are the same.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly identify segments within the queried range and ensure that it selects pairs of distinct elements within the specified range `[l, r]`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    tc = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(tc):
        N = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + N]))
        idx += N
        q = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        queries = []
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, data[idx:idx + 2])
            queries.append((l, r))
            idx += 2
        
        # Preprocess to find segments
        segments = []
        last_num = nums[0]
        start = 0
        for i in range(1, N):
            if nums[i] != last_num:
                segments.append((start + 1, i, last_num))
                start = i
                last_num = nums[i]
        segments.append((start + 1, N, last_num))
        
        for l, r in queries:
            found = False
            for s, e, num in segments:
                if s <= r and e >= l:
                    if e - s > 1:
                        found = True
                        results.append(f"{s} {s + 1}")
                        break
                    elif s >= l and e <= r:
                        if s + 1 <= r:
                            results.append(f"{s} {s + 1}")
                            found = True
                            break
            if not found:
                results.append("-1 -1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

solve()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each query, it correctly identifies if there exists a pair of distinct elements within the specified range `[l, r]`.
