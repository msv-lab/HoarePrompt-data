You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `nums`. It then processes a series of queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, it determines and prints a pair of indices `(s, e + 1)` based on the segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`. If no valid segment is found, it prints `(-1, -1)`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an array and a series of queries. Each query specifies a subarray, and for each subarray, we need to find two distinct elements or report that no such pair exists.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `tc` is read.
   - For each test case, the length of the array `N`, the array elements `nums`, and the number of queries `q` are read.

2. **Preprocessing the Array:**
   - The program creates a list `arr` that contains tuples representing segments of the array where the elements are the same. Each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of the segment.
   - This is done by iterating through the array and recording the segments where consecutive elements are equal.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if a pair of distinct elements exists within the query range:
     - If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if the previous element can form a pair with the first element of the current segment.
     - If the segment ends before `r`, it checks if the next element can form a pair with the last element of the current segment.
     - If no such pair is found, it outputs `-1 -1`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Handling of Query Ranges:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the query ranges. Specifically, it does not correctly identify when a pair of distinct elements exists within the query range.
   - The logic for checking the segments and forming pairs is flawed. For example, it does not correctly handle cases where the segment starts before `l` or ends after `r`.

2. **Incorrect Use of Binary Search:**
   - The binary search is used to find the segment that starts within the query range, but the logic to determine the pair is incorrect.
   - The program does not correctly check if there are distinct elements within the query range by examining the segments.

3. **Incorrect Output for Edge Cases:**
   - The program may output incorrect results for certain edge cases, such as when all elements in the query range are the same.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Reasoning: The program has incorrect logic for handling query ranges and determining pairs of distinct elements. It does not correctly use binary search to find the appropriate segments and does not handle edge cases properly.

Correctness: **False**
