The function reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `nums`. It then processes a series of queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, it determines and prints a pair of indices `(s, e + 1)` based on the segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`. If no valid segment is found, it prints `(-1, -1)`.
