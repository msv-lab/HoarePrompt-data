To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the code snippet provided.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `i + 1`. This suggests that `i` is being incremented by 1, but the initial value of `i` is not provided. So, we will denote the initial value of `i` as `i_initial`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is attempting to print the element at index `i` of the list `a`, twice, followed by a space.
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement, the value of `i` at the time of printing will be `i_initial + 1`.
- The exact value of `a[i]` cannot be determined because the list `a` and its contents are not provided. However, we know that `a[i]` refers to the element at the new index `i_initial + 1` in the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the element at index `i_initial + 1` of the list `a`, printed twice, followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i_initial + 1] a[i_initial + 1] (where a[i_initial + 1] is the element at index i_initial + 1 in the list a)**
