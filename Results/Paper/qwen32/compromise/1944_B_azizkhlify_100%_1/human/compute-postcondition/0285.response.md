Postcondition: **`ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop breaks early or the sum of all increments of 2 that occurred during the iterations if the loop completes all `n` iterations, `ur` remains 0, `res` remains an empty list, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `i` is 0 after the loop completes, and `re` remains 0 if `k` is 0. If `k` is not 0, then `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing elements `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, and `re` is the count of elements in `res`. In both cases, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`.**
