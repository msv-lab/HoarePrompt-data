To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is defined as `n + 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: We know that `n` is a non-negative integer. This means `n` can be any integer from 0 upwards.
2. **Variable `i`**: `i` is defined as `n + 2`. Therefore, `i` is always at least 2 (since `n` is non-negative, the smallest `n` can be is 0, making `i = 2`).

### Key Points:
- The print statement attempts to access `a[i]` twice.
- For this to work, the list `a` must have at least `i + 1` elements (since list indices start at 0).

### Output Determination:
- Given that `i` is `n + 2`, the exact value of `a[i]` cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of `n` and the contents of the list `a`.
- However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and no newline will be added at the end because of `end=' '`.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where i is n + 2 and a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
