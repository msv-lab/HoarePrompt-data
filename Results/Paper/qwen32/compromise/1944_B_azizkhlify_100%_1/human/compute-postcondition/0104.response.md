To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the conditions under which it breaks.

The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`, meaning it will execute `n` times unless it breaks prematurely due to the condition `ul == ur`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `i = n`.
2. **Condition Check**: For each `i`, it checks if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.
3. **Execution**:
   - If the condition is true, it prints `a[i]` twice, sets `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0, and increments `ur` by 2.
   - If the condition is false, it does nothing.
4. **Termination Condition**: After each iteration, it checks if `ul == ur`. If true, it breaks out of the loop.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration, if `r[a[n] - 1] == 2`, `ur` is increased by 2.
- After 2 iterations, if `r[a[n+1] - 1] == 2`, `ur` is increased by 2.
- After 3 iterations, if `r[a[n+2] - 1] == 2`, `ur` is increased by 2.

The loop will continue until either:
- It completes all `n` iterations.
- `ul` equals `ur`.

### Final Output State:

If the loop completes all `n` iterations without `ul` ever equalling `ur`, the final state will be:

- All elements in `res` that meet the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` will be printed twice.
- `ur` will be incremented by 2 for each of those elements.
- `ul` will remain unchanged unless specified otherwise in the initial state.

If the loop breaks before completing all `n` iterations due to `ul == ur`, the final state will be:

- Only the elements in `res` that were processed before the break condition met will be printed twice.
- `ur` will be incremented by 2 for each of those elements.
- `ul` will remain unchanged unless specified otherwise in the initial state.

Given the information, we cannot determine if the loop will break prematurely, but we can describe the state if it completes all iterations:

**Output State: **All elements in `res` that meet the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` are printed twice, separated by spaces. `ur` is incremented by 2 for each such element. `ul` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.**

In natural language, this means that for every element in the array `a` from index `n` to `2*n-1`, if the corresponding value in `r` (adjusted by subtracting 1) is 2, that element is printed twice. The variable `ur` is increased by 2 for each such print, and `ul` remains as it was initially unless it equals `ur` during the loop, causing the loop to break prematurely.
