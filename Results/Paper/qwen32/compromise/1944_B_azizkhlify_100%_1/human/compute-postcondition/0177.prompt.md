Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and `k` is non-zero; `ul` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero; `ul` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than 0; if `re` equals `k`, then `res` includes all `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1. Otherwise, `re` does not equal `k` and no further changes are made to `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero; `ul` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than 0; if `re` initially equals `k`, then `res` includes all `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, plus the new element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1. Otherwise, `res` includes the new element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, and no further changes are made to `res` if `l[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 1; `i` is incremented by 1; `re` is incremented by 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1; if `re` initially equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, then `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` has an additional element `a[i]` appended to it. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
