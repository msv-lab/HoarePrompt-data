The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` modifies the list `r` at the index `a[i] - 1` by setting its value to 0. The value of `i` is `n + 2`, and `n` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, `i` is at least 2.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 2`, and the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is set to 0.**

In simpler terms, the element in the list `r` at the position `a[i] - 1` is now 0, where `i` is `n + 2`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, but the specified element in `r` is updated.
