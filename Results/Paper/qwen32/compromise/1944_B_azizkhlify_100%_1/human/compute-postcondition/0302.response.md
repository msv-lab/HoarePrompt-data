Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `ur` is unchanged, `ul` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `ur`, or `ul`. It only exits the most internal loop or if statement.
