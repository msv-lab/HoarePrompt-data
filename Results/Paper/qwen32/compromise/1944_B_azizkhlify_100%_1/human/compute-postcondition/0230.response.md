The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

Given that `i` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros except that the element at index `a[n] - 1` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `re` is 0**
