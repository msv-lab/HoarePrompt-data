The code snippet `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n + 1`, and the element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` in list `r` is 0. These conditions remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `ur`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n + 1`, the element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` in list `r` is 0, and `ur` is increased by 2.**
