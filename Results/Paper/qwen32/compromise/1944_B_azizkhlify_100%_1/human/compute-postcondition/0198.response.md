To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

**Initial State:**
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

**Analysis:**
1. **Variable `a`:** The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact contents.
2. **Variable `i`:** The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Without knowing the initial value of `i`, we can only say that it has been incremented.
3. **Output:** The `print` statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space. Since `i` has been incremented, the value of `i` will be one more than its previous value.

Since the list `a` is not defined, we cannot provide the exact numerical or string values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of the list `a` and the incremented index `i`.

**Output Description:**
The code prints the value at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space. Here, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a is the list and i is incremented by 1 from its previous value)**
