The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` modifies the list `r` by setting the element at the index `a[i] - 1` to `0`. The values of `n`, `i`, and the elements of `a` and `r` (other than the one being modified) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0**.
