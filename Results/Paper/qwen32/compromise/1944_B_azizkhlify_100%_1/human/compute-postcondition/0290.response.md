Given the initial state:
- `res` is a list containing at least two elements.
- `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged (though their exact values are not specified).
- `i` is the second element in `res`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(i, end=' ')`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `i` is explicitly defined as the second element of the list `res`. Since list indexing in Python starts at 0, the second element is at index 1.
2. Therefore, `i` is `res[1]`.
3. The `print` statement will output the value of `i` followed by a space, due to the `end=' '` argument.

Since the exact contents of the list `res` are not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical or string value of `i`. However, we know that `i` is the second element of `res`.

Thus, the output will be the second element of the list `res` followed by a space.

Output: **res[1] ** (where res[1] is the second element of the list `res`)
