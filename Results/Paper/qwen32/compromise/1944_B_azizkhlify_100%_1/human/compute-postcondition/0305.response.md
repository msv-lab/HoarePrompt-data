To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is defined as `n + 1`.
- `ur` and `ul` are mentioned but are unchanged and not used in the print statement, so they are irrelevant for this task.
- The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `a` is not defined in the initial state. However, the print statement attempts to access `a[i]` twice.
- Since `i` is defined as `n + 1`, the index `i` is one position beyond the last index of the list `a` if `a` were to have `n + 1` elements.
- Given that `a` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `a[i]`. However, we can describe the print statement's behavior based on the given information.

### Output Description:
- The print statement will attempt to print `a[i]` twice, where `i` is `n + 1`.
- Since `a` is not defined, the exact values cannot be determined. However, we can describe the intended print behavior.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i], a[i] (where i is n + 1 and a is the list that should be defined to have at least n + 2 elements)**

This description captures the intended behavior of the print statement based on the given initial state.
