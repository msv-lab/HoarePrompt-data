The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last value it took, and `n` is the total number of iterations the loop is supposed to make.

Given that the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken a value from `0` to `n-2` (since the loop would have just finished the iteration where `i` was `n-1` if it just ended). To execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain the same.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is 1; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, if it was `i-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is 1; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, to be more precise in the state representation, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be `x+1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is 1; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is 1; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

For the sake of a concrete example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the state would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is 1; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 3**.

But in general, without knowing the exact value of `i`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is 1; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is incremented by 1**.
