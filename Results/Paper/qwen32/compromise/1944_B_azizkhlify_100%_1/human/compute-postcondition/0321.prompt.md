Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50,000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            l[a[i] - 1] = 0
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All elements in `res` are printed, separated by spaces. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then all elements in `res` that meet the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` are printed twice, separated by spaces, and `ur` is incremented by 2 for each such element. `ul` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, no additional elements are printed and `ur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and remains non-zero; `ul` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `i` is the last element in `res`, which contains all elements `a[i]` such that `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` and all elements have been printed; `a` and `l` remain unchanged. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` can be `2 * n` or the loop breaks when `ul` equals `ur`, and `ur` is incremented by 2 for each element `a[i]` where `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, with those elements in `r` set to 0. Otherwise, no additional changes occur to `ur` or `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ul` is the sum of all increments of 2 that occurred during the iterations, `ur` is 0 or incremented by 2 for each `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, `res` remains unchanged, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged except `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0 for each `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, `i` is the last element in `res`, `re` is the count of elements in `res`, and `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is `2 * n - 1` or the value where `ul` equals `ur`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
