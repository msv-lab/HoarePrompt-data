To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than 0.
2. `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. The variable `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we don't know its type or contents.
2. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but we don't know its initial value. Let's denote its initial value as `i_initial`. After incrementing, `i` becomes `i_initial + 1`.
3. The `print` statement attempts to print `a[i]` twice, where `i` is now `i_initial + 1`.
4. The `end=' '` argument specifies that the output should end with a space instead of a newline.

### Output Description:
Since the list `a` and the initial value of `i` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `a[i]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of the list `a` and the incremented value of `i`.

Output: **a[i_initial + 1] a[i_initial + 1] (where a is a list and i_initial is the initial value of i before incrementing)**

If we assume `i_initial` to be a specific value, for example, `i_initial = 0`, then `i` becomes `1` after incrementing, and the output would be `a[1] a[1]`. However, without the specific list `a` and the initial value of `i`, the most precise description we can provide is in terms of `a` and `i_initial`.

Thus, the final output is:

Output: **a[i_initial + 1] a[i_initial + 1] (where a is a list and i_initial is the initial value of i before incrementing)**
