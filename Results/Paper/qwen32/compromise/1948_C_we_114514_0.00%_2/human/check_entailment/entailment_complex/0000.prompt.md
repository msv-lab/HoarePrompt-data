Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

    6
    
    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

# Annotated Program:

    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True
        
        reachable_second_row = False
        
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:

                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: results
    return results
    #The program returns 'results'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing only '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to reach the end of the second string starting from the beginning of the first string, moving only to the right ('>') or switching to the corresponding position in the other string if the current character is '<'. The function returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the end of the second string is reachable.
