### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

The goal is to determine if a robot can reach the cell (2, n) starting from (1, 1) by following the arrows in the grid. The robot can move in four directions (left, right, up, down) and then must follow the arrow in the cell it lands in.

The provided code seems to have a simplified logic that only considers certain moves:
- It initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`.
- It then iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
  - If `reachable_first_row` is `True`:
    - If the arrow in `row1[j]` is `>`, it checks if `j` is the last column. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
    - If the arrow in `row1[j]` is `<`, it sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` and checks if the arrow in `row2[j]` is `>`. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
  - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`:
    - It checks if the arrow in `row2[j]` is `>`. If `j` is the last column, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (though this step seems redundant since `reachable_second_row` is already `True`).

The code essentially checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then keep moving right in the second row to reach the end. However, it does not account for all possible moves the robot can make, such as moving up or down at any point during the traversal.

Let's consider the third example from the problem statement:
```
4
>>><
>><<
```
The code would incorrectly output `NO` because:
- It starts at (1, 1) and moves right to (1, 2).
- It encounters `>` and moves right to (1, 3).
- It encounters `>` and moves right to (1, 4).
- It encounters `>` and cannot move right since it's at the end of the row, so it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` but does not actually move to the second row.
- It does not consider the possibility of moving down to the second row at any point.

This example shows that the code does not correctly handle all possible paths the robot can take. Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
