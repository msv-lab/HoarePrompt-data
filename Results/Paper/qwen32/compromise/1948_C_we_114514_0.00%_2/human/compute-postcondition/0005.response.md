In the given for loop, the only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop will iterate `n` times, starting from `j = 0` up to `j = n-1`. 

Given that `n` is already an even integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, it inherently satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. The initial value of `j` before the loop starts should be 0, as the loop initializes `j` to 0 in the first iteration.

The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts, adjusted for the loop to execute, is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, `j` is 0**
