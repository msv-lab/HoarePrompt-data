Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case consists of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing only '<' and '>' characters. The function returns a list `results` containing the output for each test case.**
