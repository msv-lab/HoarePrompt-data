Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is True, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is True, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True.** 

This means that the variable `reachable_second_row` has been set to `True` by the given code snippet, while all other variables retain their previous states.
