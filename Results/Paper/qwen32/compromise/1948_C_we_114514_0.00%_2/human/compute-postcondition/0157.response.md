To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the output states after the first three iterations.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is the first element of `test_case`.
- `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`.
- `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`.
- `reachable_first_row` is `True`.
- `reachable_second_row` is `False`.
- `results` contains `'NO'` initially.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs `n` times. Let's analyze the loop logic:

1. **First Condition Block**:
   - If `reachable_first_row` is `True`:
     - If `row1[j] == '>'`:
       - If `j == n - 1`, set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - Else:
       - Set `reachable_first_row` to `False`.
       - If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

2. **Second Condition Block**:
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`:
     - If `row2[j] == '>'` and `j == n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` remains `True`.

### Output State After Iterations:
- **After 1st Iteration**:
  - `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` depend on `row1[0]` and `row2[0]`.
  - `results` remains `'NO'`.

- **After 2nd Iteration**:
  - `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` depend on `row1[1]` and `row2[1]`.
  - `results` remains `'NO'`.

- **After 3rd Iteration**:
  - `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` depend on `row1[2]` and `row2[2]`.
  - `results` remains `'NO'`.

### Final Output State:
By the time the loop completes all `n` iterations:
- `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will be determined based on the values in `row1` and `row2` throughout all iterations.
- `results` will contain `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` becomes `True` at any point, otherwise it will be `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will be:
- `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are determined by the final values after all iterations.
- `results` will be `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is `True` at the end of the loop, otherwise `'NO'`.

Given the loop logic and the fact that `results` only changes to `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` becomes `True`, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is `False` or `True` based on `row1` and `row2`, `reachable_second_row` is `True` or `False` based on `row1` and `row2`, `results` is `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is `True` else `'NO'`.**

In simpler terms, the final output state depends on whether the second row becomes reachable by the end of the loop, and the `results` list will contain `'YES'` if it is reachable, otherwise `'NO'`.
