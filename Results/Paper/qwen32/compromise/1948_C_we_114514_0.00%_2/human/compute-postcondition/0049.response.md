To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the conditions provided.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the strings `row1` and `row2`. The loop's behavior depends on the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` and the characters in `row1` and `row2`.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `reachable_first_row` is `True`.
   - `reachable_second_row` is `False`.
   
2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For each `j` from `0` to `n-1`:
     - If `reachable_first_row` is `True`:
       - If `row1[j]` is `'>'`:
         - If `j` is `n-1`, set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
       - If `row1[j]` is `'<'`:
         - Set `reachable_first_row` to `False`.
         - If `j < n-1` and `row2[j]` is `'>'`, set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`:
       - If `row2[j]` is `'>'` and `j` is `n-1`, set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

### Key Observations:
- The loop continues to iterate `n` times regardless of the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`.
- `reachable_first_row` can become `False` if a `'<'` is encountered in `row1` before reaching the end.
- `reachable_second_row` can become `True` if:
  - `reachable_first_row` is `True` and a `'>'` is encountered in `row1` at the last position (`j == n-1`).
  - `reachable_first_row` is `False` and a `'>'` is encountered in `row2` before the last position.
  - `reachable_second_row` is already `True` and a `'>'` is encountered in `row2` at the last position (`j == n-1`).

### Final State:
After `n` iterations, the loop will have checked all characters in `row1` and `row2`. The final values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will depend on the specific characters in `row1` and `row2`.

### Output State:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` remains a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters.
- `results` remains an empty list.
- `n` remains an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5).
- `row1` and `row2` remain strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters.
- `reachable_first_row` is `True` or `False` based on the characters in `row1`.
- `reachable_second_row` is `True` or `False` based on the characters in `row1` and `row2`.

The final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `reachable_first_row` is True or False based on the characters in `row1`, `reachable_second_row` is True or False based on the characters in `row1` and `row2`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop will have determined whether the second row can be reached based on the characters in `row1` and `row2`, and the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will reflect this determination.
