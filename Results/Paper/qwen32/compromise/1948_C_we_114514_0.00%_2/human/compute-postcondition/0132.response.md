Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, then if `row2[j]` equals `'>'` and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, the current value of `j` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, the state remains unchanged.**
