To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case
- `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is True, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is False
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`
- `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`
- `reachable_first_row` is True
- If `reachable_second_row` is True, the current element `row2[j]` is `'>'`. Additionally, if `j` equals `n - 1`, the specific condition for `j` being the last index is met.
- If `reachable_second_row` is False, no changes are made to `row2[j]`.

In the for loop:
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have taken on a value from 0 to `n-1`. To start the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value
- `n` remains the same as it determines the range of the loop

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is True, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is True, `j` is `j + 1`**
