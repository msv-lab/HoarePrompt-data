Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is 0, `row1[j]` is not equal to '>', and `j < n - 1` and `row2[j]` is equal to '>'**

The only change in the output state is that `reachable_second_row` has been set to True. All other variables retain their initial values.
