Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case` and `row2[j]` equals `'>'`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. `reachable_second_row` is `True`. If `j` is equal to `n - 1`, the current value of `j` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, there is no else part to modify the state.**
