Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` equals `'>'`, then `j` is incremented. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `j` remains 0.**
