Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. Additionally, `row1[j]` is `'>'`, and `j` is equal to `n - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_second_row` has been changed from `False` to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
