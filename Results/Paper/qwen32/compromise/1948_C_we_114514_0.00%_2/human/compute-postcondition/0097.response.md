Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `j` is `j + 2`. If `row1[j] == '>'` and `j` equals `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` remains `True`. If `row1[j] == '>'` and `j` is less than `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains `True` and `reachable_second_row` retains its original value. If `row1[j] != '>'`, `reachable_first_row` becomes `False`. If `row1[j] != '>'` and `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` retains its original value.**
