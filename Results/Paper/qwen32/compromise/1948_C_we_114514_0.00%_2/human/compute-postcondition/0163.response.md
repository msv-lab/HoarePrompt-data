To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the logic of the loop and how it processes each test case. The loop iterates over a list of test cases, and for each test case, it determines whether it is possible to reach the second row from the first row based on the characters in the two strings `row1` and `row2`.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- `reachable_first_row` starts as `True` and becomes `False` if a '<' character is encountered in `row1` before reaching the end.
- `reachable_second_row` starts as `False` and becomes `True` if:
  - The end of `row1` is reached with `reachable_first_row` still `True`.
  - Any '>' character in `row2` is encountered when `reachable_first_row` is `False` and the corresponding position in `row2` has a '>' character.
  - The end of `row2` is reached with `reachable_second_row` still `True`.

The loop appends 'YES' to `results` if `reachable_second_row` is `True` after processing a test case, otherwise it appends 'NO'.

Given the initial state and the descriptions of the states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to process each test case in `test_cases` until all test cases have been processed. The final state will be determined by the results of all these test cases.

Since the problem does not provide specific test cases, we can only describe the final output state in terms of the processed test cases.

**Output State: **results** is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases` based on whether the second row is reachable from the first row.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is a list of 'YES' and 'NO' corresponding to each test case, indicating whether it is possible to reach the second row from the first row based on the given conditions.
