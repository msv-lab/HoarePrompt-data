Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `results` is an empty list.**

The initial state of `t` and the test cases remain unchanged. The only change is that an empty list `results` is created.
