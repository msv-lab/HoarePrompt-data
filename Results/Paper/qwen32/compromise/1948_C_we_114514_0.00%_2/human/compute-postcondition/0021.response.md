The provided code snippet simply reassigns the value `True` to the variable `reachable_second_row`. Since this variable was already `True` in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `reachable_second_row` is True, `row2[j]` is '>', and `j` is equal to `n - 1`.**
