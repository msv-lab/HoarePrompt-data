The code snippet sets `reachable_second_row` to `False`. This change affects the `reachable_second_row` variable, while other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `reachable_first_row` is `True`, and `results` contains either `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the value of `reachable_second_row`. Since `reachable_second_row` is now `False`, the corresponding entry in `results` would logically be `'NO'`, but the code snippet itself does not modify the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is True, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is False, `n` is the first element of the next `test_case`, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False.**
