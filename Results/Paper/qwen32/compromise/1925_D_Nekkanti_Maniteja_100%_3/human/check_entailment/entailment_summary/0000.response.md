### Reasoning:
Let's break down the provided Python program and compare it with the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It initializes `s` to 0, which will store the sum of the expected friendship values.
   - It initializes `a` to 0, which will store the sum of all initial friendship values.
   - For each friend pair, it adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.
   - For each excursion (from 0 to `k-1`), it updates `s` by adding the contribution of the current excursion to the expected sum. The formula used is `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, but this is incorrect based on the problem's requirements.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result `s % M` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect for calculating the expected value. The expected value calculation should account for the probability of selecting each pair and the increase in friendship values over time.
- The expected value for each pair of friends should be calculated considering that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen.
- The contribution of each pair of friends should be calculated correctly based on the number of times it could be chosen and its increasing friendship value.

### Correct Formula Derivation:
- For each pair of friends with initial friendship value `f`, the expected contribution to the sum over `k` excursions is the sum of a series where the friendship value increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen.
- The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen is `k / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
- The expected contribution of a pair with initial friendship value `f` is the sum of an arithmetic series: `f + (f + 1) + (f + 2) + ... + (f + (number of times chosen - 1))`.
- This can be simplified to `number of times chosen * (2 * f + number of times chosen - 1) / 2`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the provided program does not correctly calculate the expected sum of friendship values based on the problem's requirements, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
