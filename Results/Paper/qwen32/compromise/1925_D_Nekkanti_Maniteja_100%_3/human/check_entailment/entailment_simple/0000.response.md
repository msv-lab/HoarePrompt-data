### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: number of children.
     - `m`: number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: number of excursions.
     - `m` lines of `a_i, b_i, f_i` representing pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as `p * q^-1 mod (10^9 + 7)`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7`: Modulo value.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`: Inverse of the total number of possible pairs `(n * (n - 1) // 2)` modulo `M`. This is used to normalize the probability of selecting any specific pair.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - `a = 0`: Sum of all initial friendship values.
   - For each friendship pair `(u, v, f)`, `a += f`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - `s = 0`: Accumulator for the expected sum of friendship values.
   - For each excursion `i` from `0` to `k-1`:
     - `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`: This line seems incorrect. It should be calculating the expected value incrementally based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and the incremental increase in friendship values.

#### Correctness of the Program:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the following reasons:
- The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. It does not properly account for the incremental increase in friendship values for friend pairs and the probability of selecting them.
- The expected value should consider the probability of selecting a friend pair and the probability of selecting a non-friend pair, and how the friendship values evolve over the `k` excursions.

#### Correct Approach:
1. Calculate the expected value incrementally:
   - For each friend pair, the expected contribution to the sum over `k` excursions is the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - For each non-friend pair, the expected contribution is `0`.

2. Sum these contributions for all pairs and normalize by the total number of possible pairs.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to compute the expected value.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
