The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means that the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated based on the input, but the values of `s`, `M`, `c`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged unless they are affected by subsequent code (which is not provided here).

Output State: **`s` is \(\frac{c^2 \cdot m \cdot (2m + k - 3) \cdot k}{2} + k \cdot c \cdot a\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `M` is 10, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo 10, `a` is the sum of all f values from the input, `i` is \(m + k\)**

In simpler terms, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values provided in the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
