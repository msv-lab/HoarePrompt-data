Output State: **`s` is \(\frac{c^2 \cdot m \cdot (2m + k - 3) \cdot k}{2} + k \cdot c \cdot a\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `M` is \(10^9 + 7\), `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo 10, `a` is the sum of all f values from the input, `i` is \(m + k\)**

In simple terms, the value of `M` has been updated to \(10^9 + 7\). All other variables retain their original values as specified in the initial state.
