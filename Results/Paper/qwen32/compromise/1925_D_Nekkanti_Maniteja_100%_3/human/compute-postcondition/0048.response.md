The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range specified by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is \(m + k - 1\). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **s is \(\frac{c^2 \cdot m \cdot (2m + k - 3) \cdot k}{2} + k \cdot c \cdot a\), n is the first integer from the input, m is the second integer from the input, k is the third integer from the input, M is 10, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo 10, a is the sum of all f values from the input, i is \(m + k\)**
