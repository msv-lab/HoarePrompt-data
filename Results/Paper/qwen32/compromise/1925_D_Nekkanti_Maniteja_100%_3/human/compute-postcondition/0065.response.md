Output State: **`s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo 1000000007, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the `m` iterations, `i` is `m + k`.**

In simple terms, the value of `s` is updated to include the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
