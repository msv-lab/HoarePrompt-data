The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The variables `s` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, `s` is already calculated as `(c * a * k + (c * c * m * k * (k - 1) // 2)) % M` and `i` is incremented by 1. Since `n`, `m`, and `k` are reassigned, their previous values are no longer relevant.

Output State: **`s` is `(c * a * k + (c * c * m * k * (k - 1) // 2)) % M`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input.**
