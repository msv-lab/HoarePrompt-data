The code calculates the midpoint between `small_element` and `big_element` and assigns it to the variable `mid`. Given that `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` will be `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(right - left) // 2`. The initial conditions for `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `mid`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, and `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.**
