Let's analyze the loop and determine the changes to the variables involved.

Given:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < \text{len(arr)}\).
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier.
- `small_element` is initialized to `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is initialized to `right + 1`.
- `mid` is calculated as \((\text{right} - \text{left}) // 2\).
- `not_mid` is calculated as \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 2) // 2\).

The loop iterates `mid` times, and in each iteration:
- `arr[left + i]` is set to `small_element + i`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `arr[left]` will be set to `small_element` (which is `left + 1`).
- `arr[left + 1]` will be set to `small_element + 1` (which is `left + 2`).
- This pattern continues up to `arr[left + mid - 1]` which will be set to `small_element + mid - 1` (which is `left + mid`).

The elements of `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` will be updated to a sequence starting from `left + 1` up to `left + mid`.

- `cliquess[left]` will be set to `clique`.
- `cliquess[left + 1]` will be set to `clique`.
- This pattern continues up to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` which will be set to `clique`.

The elements of `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` will be set to `clique`.

The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is left + 1, `big_element` is right + 1, `mid` is (right - left) // 2, and `not_mid` is (right - left + 2) // 2. Additionally, arr[left] to arr[left + mid - 1] are set to the sequence left + 1 to left + mid, and cliquess[left] to cliquess[left + mid - 1] are set to clique.**
