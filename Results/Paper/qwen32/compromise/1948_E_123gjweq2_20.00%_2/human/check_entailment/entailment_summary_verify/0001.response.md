### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the provided function summaries to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to assign distinct integers to vertices of a graph.
- We need to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
- Two vertices \(i\) and \(j\) are connected if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
    - It calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`.
    - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`.
    - It calls `make_array` for each clique.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
    - It assigns values to vertices in the range `[left, right]`.
    - It assigns the specified `clique` identifier to all elements in the modified portion of `arr`.
    - It fills the first half of the range with increasing values and the second half with decreasing values.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `make_array` modifies a portion of the array `arr` from index `left` to `right` (inclusive) by setting the first half to increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half to decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. It also assigns the specified `clique` identifier to all elements in the modified portion of `arr`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Edge Condition Not Checked**:
    - The program does not explicitly check the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) for every pair of vertices.
    - The assignment of values and cliques is based on a heuristic (dividing vertices into `ceil(n / k)` cliques) without ensuring the edge condition.

2. **Optimal Clique Partitioning**:
    - The program does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques. It simply divides the vertices into `ceil(n / k)` cliques, which is not always optimal.

3. **Global Variables**:
    - The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used globally within the `make_array` function, which can lead to issues if the function is called multiple times or if the program is expanded.

4. **Incorrect Output**:
    - The program may not produce a valid partition where every pair of vertices within a clique satisfies the edge condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the edge condition is satisfied for all pairs of vertices and does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques.

**Final: False**
