Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Global Variables**: The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are defined as local variables within `func_1`, but they are also accessed and modified within `make_array`. This will cause a `UnboundLocalError` because Python will treat `arr` and `cliquess` as local variables within `make_array` unless they are declared as `global` or passed as arguments.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `mid`**: The calculation of `mid` within `make_array` is incorrect. The intent seems to be to split the range `[left, right]` into two parts, but the current calculation does not achieve this correctly. Specifically, `mid` is calculated as `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, which does not account for the offset `left`.

3. **Incorrect Assignment of `arr` and `cliquess`**: The assignment of values to `arr` and `cliquess` within `make_array` is incorrect. The code assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` in a way that does not ensure that `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs `(i, j)` within the same clique.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is small or `k` is large. For example, when `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the code should output `2 1`, `1`, and `1 1` as shown in the example, but the current implementation does not guarantee this.

5. **Partitioning into Cliques**: The code does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The current implementation does not consider the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs within the same clique, which is crucial for forming valid cliques.

Here is a corrected version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    arr = list(range(1, n + 1))
    cliques = 1
    cliquess = [1] * n

    for i in range(1, n):
        if any(abs(i - j) + abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) > k for j in range(i)):
            cliques += 1
            cliquess[i] = cliques

    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

# Example usage:
# func_1(2, 3)
# func_1(5, 4)
# func_1(8, 16)
```

This corrected version ensures that each vertex is assigned a distinct integer and that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
