Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Global Variables**: The `arr` and `cliquess` lists are used in both `func_1` and `make_array`, but they are not declared as global variables inside `make_array`. This will result in a `UnboundLocalError` when the function tries to modify these lists.

2. **Logic for Assigning Values**: The logic for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` is flawed. The program is supposed to ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for each pair of vertices in the same clique. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this.

3. **Output Format**: The program does not format the output correctly for each test case. It should print the results for each test case on separate lines.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases, such as when `n` is small or `k` is large, correctly.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be revised to correctly assign values to `arr` and `cliquess` while ensuring the condition is satisfied, and it should handle the output format correctly for each test case. Here is a possible corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def solve(n, k):
    arr = list(range(1, n + 1))
    cliques = [1] * n
    
    # Assign values and cliques
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if abs(i - j) + abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) > k:
                cliques[j] = cliques[i] + 1
                break
    
    max_clique = max(cliques)
    return arr, max_clique, cliques

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        k = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        arr, q, cliques = solve(n, k)
        results.append(" ".join(map(str, arr)))
        results.append(str(q))
        results.append(" ".join(map(str, cliques)))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version should handle the problem requirements correctly and produce the expected output.
