Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to assign distinct integers to vertices of a graph and then partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques such that every pair of vertices within a clique can be connected by an edge according to the given condition: \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

### Program Analysis:
The program uses two functions:
1. `func_1(n, k)`: This function calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) needed and initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`. It then calls `make_array` for each clique.
2. `make_array(left, right, clique)`: This function assigns values to vertices in the range `[left, right]` and assigns them to the same clique.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Initialization and Array Assignment:**
   - `arr` is supposed to store the values assigned to each vertex.
   - `cliquess` is supposed to store the clique number for each vertex.
   - `cliques` is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`, which is a reasonable estimate for the number of cliques but may not always be optimal.

2. **Edge Condition Check:**
   - The program does not explicitly check the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) for every pair of vertices. Instead, it assigns values and cliques in a way that is supposed to minimize the number of cliques, but this is not guaranteed to be correct.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the values assigned to vertices, the number of cliques, and the clique assignment for each vertex.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Edge Condition Not Checked:**
   - The program does not ensure that the assigned values and clique numbers satisfy the edge condition for all pairs of vertices. This can lead to incorrect clique assignments.

2. **Optimal Clique Partitioning:**
   - The program does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques. It simply divides the vertices into `ceil(n / k)` cliques, which may not be optimal.

3. **Global Variables:**
   - The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used globally within the `make_array` function, which can lead to issues if the function is called multiple times or if the program is expanded.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the edge condition is satisfied for all pairs of vertices and does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques.

**Correctness: False**
