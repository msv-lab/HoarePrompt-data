The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 40, and `k` is between 1 and 2n. It initializes an array `arr` of size `n` and fills it with blocks of `k` elements, each block containing consecutive integers starting from 1 up to the number of cliques (`ceil(n / k)`). Another array `cliquess` of size `n` is initialized with zeros. The function prints the filled `arr` array, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array which remains unchanged as all zeros.
