Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n > 1`:
     - `ans1` is calculated as the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `a * n`.
     - `ans2` is calculated as the cost if the yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible, with any remaining yogurt bought individually: `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
     - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If `n == 1`:
     - Since there is only one yogurt, the cost is simply `a`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic for `n > 1` ensures that the program considers both the scenario where all yogurts are bought individually and the scenario where yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible.
   - The calculation for `ans2` correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by adding the cost of an additional yogurt if there is one left over after pairing.
   - The special case for `n == 1` is correctly handled by directly printing `a`.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case (2 yogurts, 5 burles each, 9 burles for 2): `ans1 = 10`, `ans2 = 9`, so the output is 9.
   - For the second test case (3 yogurts, 5 burles each, 9 burles for 2): `ans1 = 15`, `ans2 = 14`, so the output is 14.
   - For the third test case (3 yogurts, 5 burles each, 11 burles for 2): `ans1 = 15`, `ans2 = 15`, so the output is 15.
   - For the fourth test case (4 yogurts, 5 burles each, 11 burles for 2): `ans1 = 20`, `ans2 = 22`, so the output is 20.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
