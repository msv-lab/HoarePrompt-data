You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints the minimum cost, which is either `a * n` or `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, depending on the value of `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all cases. Specifically, the issue lies in the calculation of `ans2`, which is intended to represent the cost when buying yogurts in pairs and possibly one additional yogurt individually.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
```
This formula is incorrect because it does not properly account for the number of pairs and the potential single yogurt. For example, if `n` is odd, the formula will always add the price of one yogurt (`a`) even if it would be cheaper to buy an additional pair.

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the issue:
- Input: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Expected Output: `15` (Buy two yogurts for 11 burles and one yogurt for 5 burles)
- Actual Output from the program: `16` (Incorrectly calculates as `11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2` which equals `16`)

The correct approach would be to calculate the number of pairs and the remaining yogurt separately:
```python
pairs = n // 2
remaining = n % 2
ans2 = pairs * b + remaining * a
```

Thus, the program is incorrect for cases where buying an additional yogurt individually is more expensive than buying another pair.
