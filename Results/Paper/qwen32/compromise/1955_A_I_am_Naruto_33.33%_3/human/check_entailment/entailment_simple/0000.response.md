### Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` for one yogurt and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price for one yogurt), and `b` (price for two yogurts).

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n > 1`, the program calculates two potential total costs:
     - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought individually at the regular price `a`. This is simply `a * n`.
     - `ans2`: The cost if the yogurts are bought in pairs whenever possible and at the promotional price `b`. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2)` (cost for the pairs) plus `a * (n % 2)` (cost for any remaining yogurt that cannot form a pair).
   - If `n == 1`, the program directly sets the cost to `a` since there are no pairs to consider.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case, ensuring that Maxim spends the least amount of burles.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
  - Minimum cost: `9`
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
  - Minimum cost: `14`
- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
  - Minimum cost: `15`
- **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
  - Minimum cost: `20`

All these calculations match the expected output, confirming that the program correctly computes the minimum cost for each scenario.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts given the prices `a` and `b`. It handles both scenarios where `n` is greater than 1 and where `n` is 1.

**Correctness: True**
