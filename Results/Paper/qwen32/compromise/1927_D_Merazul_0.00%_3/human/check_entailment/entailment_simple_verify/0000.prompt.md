You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to be addressing the problem description correctly. The program appears to be attempting to solve a different problem, possibly related to set operations and intersections, rather than finding pairs of different elements within specified ranges of an array.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect based on the given problem description:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The task is to find two different indices `i` and `j` within a given range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`. If no such pair exists, the program should output `-1 -1`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads input values but does not process them correctly to find the required pairs.
   - The program uses set operations (`a = {*R()}` and `b = {*R()}`) which do not align with the problem requirements.
   - The logic involving `f`, `m`, and `n` does not seem to correspond to solving the problem of finding different elements within a specified range.
   - The final print statement uses a string slicing approach to output 'YES' or 'NO', which is not aligned with the problem's output requirements of printing indices or `-1 -1`.

3. **Example Case**: Let's consider the first test case from the problem description:
   ```
   5
   1 1 2 1 1
   3
   1 5
   1 2
   1 3
   ```
   - For the query `1 5`, the program should output `2 3` because `a[2] != a[3]` (1 != 2).
   - For the query `1 2`, the program should output `-1 -1` because all elements in the range are the same (1).
   - For the query `1 3`, the program should output `2 3` because `a[2] != a[3]` (1 != 2).

   The provided program does not handle these cases correctly, as it does not even attempt to find indices within the specified ranges.

Given these points, the program is clearly not solving the problem as described, and thus the correctness is **False**.
