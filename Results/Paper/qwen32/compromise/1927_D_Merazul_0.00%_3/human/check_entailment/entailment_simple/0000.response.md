### Reasoning:

Let's review the problem and the provided code to determine if the code correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries.
- Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`.
- For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `l ≤ i ≤ r`, `l ≤ j ≤ r`, and `a_i ≠ a_j`. If such a pair does not exist, we should return `-1 -1`.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code does not seem to correctly address the problem. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is read as the length of the array, `a` is read as a set of integers, and `q` is read as the number of queries.
   - The set `b` is read but it is not clear what it represents in the context of the problem.
   
2. **Logic:**
   - The code initializes several variables `f`, `m`, and `n` and then iterates over a range from `1` to `k` (which is `q` in the problem statement, but `k` is not clearly defined in the code).
   - It checks if each integer `i` in the range is in sets `a` and `b` and performs bitwise operations on `f`, `m`, and `n`.
   - Finally, it prints a result based on the values of `f`, `m`, and `n`.

#### Issues:
- The code does not iterate over the queries as described in the problem.
- It does not find two indices `i` and `j` in the specified range `[l, r]` for each query.
- It does not handle the case where no such pair exists.
- The logic and variables used do not align with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem.
