Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `k // 2`, `a` is the set of integers returned by `R()`, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `R` is a lambda function, `k` is the last value read from the input by `R()`, `b` is the set of integers returned by `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is `k // 2`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    u = i in a
    v = i in b
    f &= u | v
    m -= u & ~v
    n -= ~u & v


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `k // 2` incremented by `0`, `1`, or `2` based on the values of `u` and `v`, `a` is the set of integers returned by `R()`, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `R` is a lambda function, `k` must be at least 1, `b` is the set of integers returned by `R()`, `f` is `1` if `u` or `v` is `True`, otherwise `f` is `0`, `m` is `k // 2 - (u & ~v)`, `u` is `True` if `i` is in `a`, otherwise `u` is `False`, `v` is `True` if `i` is in `b`, otherwise `v` is `False`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - If `u` is `True` and `v` is `True`, `n` remains `k // 2` incremented by `0`, `1`, or `2`.
- If `u` is `False` and `v` is `True`, `n` becomes `k // 2` incremented by `1`, `2`, or `3`.
- If `v` is `False`, `n` remains `k // 2` incremented by `0`, `1`, or `2`.

In summary, the value of `n` is adjusted by `1` if `u` is `False` and `v` is `True`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` remains `i + 1`; `k` remains the same; `u` remains `True` if `i + 1` is in `a`, otherwise `u` remains `False`; `v` remains `True` if `i` is in `b`, otherwise `v` remains `False`; `f` remains `f & (u | v)`; `m` is decremented by 1 if `u` is `True` and `v` is `False`, otherwise `m` remains the same; `n` is decremented by `v` if `u` is `False`, otherwise `n` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
