The code snippet assigns the value of `k // 2` to both `m` and `n`. Given that `k` is the last value read from the input by `R()`, the value of `n` is updated to `k // 2`, and `m` is also set to `k // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1; `n` is `k // 2`; `a` is a set of integers read from the input; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer; `k` is the last value read from the input by `R()`, and `b` is a set of integers read from the input; `f` is 1; `m` is `k // 2`.**
