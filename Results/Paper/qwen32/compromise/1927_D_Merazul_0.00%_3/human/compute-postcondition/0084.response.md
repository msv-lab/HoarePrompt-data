Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It also receives an integer `q` and `q` queries, where each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. The function returns the result of each query, which is the sum of the integers in the list `a` from index `l` to `r` (1-based indexing).**
