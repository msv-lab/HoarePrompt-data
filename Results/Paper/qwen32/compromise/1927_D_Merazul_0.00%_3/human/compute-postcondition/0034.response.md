Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `k // 2 - sum(~u & v for i in range(1, k + 1))`, `a` is the set of integers returned by `R()`, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `R` is a lambda function, `k` is the last value read from the input by `R()`, `b` is the set of integers returned by `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is `k // 2 - sum(u & ~v for i in range(1, k + 1))`**

The variable `f` has been set to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
