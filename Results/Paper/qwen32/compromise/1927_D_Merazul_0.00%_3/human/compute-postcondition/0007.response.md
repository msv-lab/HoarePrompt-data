Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a set of integers read from the input; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer; `k` is the last value read from the input by `R()`, and `b` is a set of integers read from the input; `f` is 1.**

In this output state, the variable `f` is assigned the value 1. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
