Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and `t` is decreased by 1; `k` is the last element of the tuple or list returned by `R()`; `a` is a set containing the elements of the tuple or list returned by `R()`; `b` is a set containing the elements of the tuple or list returned by `R()`**

Explanation: The value of `t` is still greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1. The variable `k` remains the last element of the tuple or list returned by `R()`. The set `a` still contains the elements of the tuple or list returned by `R()`. The new set `b` is also created and contains the same elements as the tuple or list returned by `R()`.
