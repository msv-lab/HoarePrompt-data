Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each query, l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
