Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The code is structured to handle a different problem, specifically one involving a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is not related to the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur.

The problem requires us to determine the year in which all n signs will occur sequentially, given their periodicities. The provided code, however, appears to be a solution for a different problem, possibly related to a sequence of characters and counting certain patterns.

Let's analyze why the provided code is incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to be designed to count the maximum number of '@' characters in a sequence, considering certain constraints ('*').
   - It does not incorporate the logic required to find the year in which each sign occurs based on its periodicity.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` with a path (which is not defined in the problem context) and collects results.
   - The results are then printed, but they do not correspond to the years in which the n-th sign occurs.

To solve the given problem, the correct approach would involve iterating through each test case, and for each sign, finding the next occurrence year based on its periodicity, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.

Here's a correct implementation for the given problem:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(n, periods):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periods:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current_year
        next_occurrence = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
        current_year = next_occurrence
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(n, periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case based on the periodicities provided.
