Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not related to the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen based on the periodicities of the signs.

The problem requires us to determine the year in which each sign occurs sequentially, given their periodicities. The provided `func_1` function seems to be solving a different problem related to some path with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to this problem.

Let's outline a correct approach to solve the given problem:
1. For each test case, read the number of signs `n` and their periodicities `a_i`.
2. Initialize the current year to 0.
3. For each sign, find the next occurrence year after the current year.
4. Update the current year to this next occurrence year.
5. Repeat until all signs have occurred.
6. Output the year in which the last sign occurs.

The provided program does not implement this logic. Instead, it attempts to solve a different problem.

Correctness: **False**
