### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to process a sequence of characters (`@` and `*`) and calculate a score based on the presence of `@` characters, considering certain constraints imposed by `*`.
   - The function does not take into account the periodicity of signs or the sequential occurrence of signs as required by the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` with a path (which is not relevant to the problem at hand).
   - It collects results from `func_1` and prints them, but these results do not correspond to the years in which the n-th sign occurs based on the given periodicities.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- For each test case, iterate through the list of periodicities.
- For each sign, determine the next occurrence year after the previous sign occurred.
- Keep track of the current year and update it based on the next occurrence of each sign.

Here is the correct implementation:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(n, periods):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periods:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current_year
        next_occurrence = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
        current_year = next_occurrence
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(n, periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Final Evaluation:

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
