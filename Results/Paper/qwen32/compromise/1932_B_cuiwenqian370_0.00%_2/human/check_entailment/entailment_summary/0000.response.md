Reasoning: 

The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) do not seem to address the problem described. The problem involves determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur given the periodicity of each sign. The sequence of events is important, and the occurrence of each subsequent sign depends on the year of the previous sign's occurrence.

However, `func_1` appears to be designed to solve a completely different problem, likely related to counting the maximum number of '@' symbols in a sequence, ignoring '*' symbols. `func_2` reads input and applies `func_1` to each test case, but since `func_1` does not solve the problem at hand, the overall solution is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, we would need a function that iterates through each sign's periodicity and calculates the year of occurrence based on the previous sign's occurrence.

Correctness: **False**
