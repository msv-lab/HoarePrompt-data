Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', and the length of `path` is a non-negative integer `n`; `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 1; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros except `dp[0]` which is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', and `-inf` if the first character of `path` is '*'; the second character of `path` is '*'; `dp[1]` is `-inf`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `path` remains unchanged as a list of characters with length `n` where `n` is greater than 1. The `dp` list also remains mostly unchanged except that `dp[1]` is now `-inf`. The second character of `path` is still '*'.
