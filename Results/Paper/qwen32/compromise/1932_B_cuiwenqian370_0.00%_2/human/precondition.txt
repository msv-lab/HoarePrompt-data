The function `max_coins_collected` is intended to solve a different problem than described. For the given problem, the function should be named appropriately, such as `apocalypse_year`. The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.
