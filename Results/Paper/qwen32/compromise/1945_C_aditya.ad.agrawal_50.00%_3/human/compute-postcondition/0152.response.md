Output State: **t is 0, n is an input integer, a remains unchanged, input_string is the new string input by the user, arr is the list of integers derived from input_string, z is the count of 0s in arr, o is the count of 1s in arr, z_l is the count of 0s in arr, o_l is the count of 1s in arr, z_r is 0, o_r is 0, dist is abs(n / 2), ans is the position where conditions were last met or 0, pos is n, b_d is the minimum abs(n / 2 - pos) where conditions were met or 30001.**

Explanation: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
