The given code snippet increments the variable `o_l` by 1. No other variables are modified in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `o_l` while all other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` that must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 1`, `o_l` is `o_l + 1`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)` if the condition is met, otherwise `b_d` retains its previous value, `ans` is set to `pos` if the condition is met, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `i` is the next element in `arr`.**
