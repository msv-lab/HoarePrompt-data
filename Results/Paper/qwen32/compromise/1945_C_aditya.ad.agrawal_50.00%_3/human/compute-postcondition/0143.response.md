Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` that must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 1`, `z_l` is `z_l + 1`, `b_d` is `b_d` (retains its previous value), `ans` is `ans` (retains its previous value), `i` is the next element in `arr`, `z_r` is `z_r - 1`.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `z_r`, which has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
