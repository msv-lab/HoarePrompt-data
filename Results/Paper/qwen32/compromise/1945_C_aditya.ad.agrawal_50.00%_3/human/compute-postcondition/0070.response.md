The code snippet `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001, and `i` is 0.**
