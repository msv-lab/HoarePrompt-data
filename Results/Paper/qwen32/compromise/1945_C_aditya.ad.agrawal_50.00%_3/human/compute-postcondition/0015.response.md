The code snippet simply assigns the value `30001` to the variable `b_d`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, and `o_r` is less than `(z_r + o_r) / 2`; `b_d` is 30001.**
