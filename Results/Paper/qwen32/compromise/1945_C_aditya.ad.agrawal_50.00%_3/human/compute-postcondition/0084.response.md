The code snippet provided is `o_l += 1`, which increments the value of `o_l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged unless `o_l` is part of a condition that affects them, but no such conditions are present in the given code snippet.

Given the initial state, the only change is the increment of `o_l`.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is `pos` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `pos` is `pos + 1`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001. If `i` is 0, then `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0. If `i` is not 0, then `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 1, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `o_l` is incremented by 1.**
