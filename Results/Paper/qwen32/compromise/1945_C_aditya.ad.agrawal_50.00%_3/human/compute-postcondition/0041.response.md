The code snippet provided is simply `pos += 1`, which increments the variable `pos` by 1. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one more element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is `pos` and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `b_d` retains its original value. `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is the position of the next element to be processed and `pos` is incremented by 1.**
