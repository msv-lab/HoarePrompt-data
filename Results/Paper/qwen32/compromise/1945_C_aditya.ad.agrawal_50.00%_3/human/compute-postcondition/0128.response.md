The code snippet updates the value of `b_d` to be the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`. The other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial state, the new value of `b_d` is calculated as `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` that must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 1, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`**.
