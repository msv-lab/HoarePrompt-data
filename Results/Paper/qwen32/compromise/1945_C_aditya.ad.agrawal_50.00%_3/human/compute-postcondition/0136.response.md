Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` that must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 1`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is 1 and `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is `z_l + 1` and `z_r` is `z_r - 1`. If `i` is not 0, `o_l` is `o_l + 1` and `o` is `o - 1`. `i` is the next element in `arr`.**
