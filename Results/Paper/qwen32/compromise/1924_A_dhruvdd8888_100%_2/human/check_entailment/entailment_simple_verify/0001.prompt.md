You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of a given string `s`. If not, we need to provide a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Set of Possible Characters**:
   - `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

3. **Checking Subsequences**:
   - `win` is a set used to track the characters encountered in the current window.
   - `ans` is a list that seems to accumulate characters, but its usage is unclear.
   - `ps` is a counter for the number of times all `k` characters have been seen in sequence.
   - The loop iterates through each character in `s`. If the character is in `us`, it is added to `win`.
   - When `win` contains all `k` characters, `ps` is incremented, and `win` is cleared.

4. **Output**:
   - If `ps` is at least `n`, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and attempts to construct a string that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Logic for Counting Subsequences**:
   - The program does not correctly count the number of distinct subsequences of length `n` in `s`.
   - The logic for incrementing `ps` and clearing `win` does not accurately reflect the number of subsequences.

2. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence**:
   - The method for constructing a string that is not a subsequence is incorrect. It does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Correctness
Given the issues in the logic for counting subsequences and constructing the missing subsequence, the program is not correct.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
