You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000.

The program prints ''.join(ans) + x + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1) and terminates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. It then checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` complete sets of `k` unique letters. If it does, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' and attempts to construct and print a string of length `n` using the letters found in `s` and additional 'a' characters to meet the length requirement.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are a few reasons why the code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Subsequences**:
   - The program attempts to check for the presence of all possible subsequences of length `n` using a sliding window approach, but it does not correctly identify whether all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.
   - The program clears the window (`win`) once it finds `k` unique characters, which does not guarantee that all subsequences of length `n` are checked.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Subsequences**:
   - The program does not generate all possible subsequences of length `n` and check if they exist in `s`.
   - The program uses a set `win` to track unique characters in a window, but it does not ensure that all combinations of these characters form subsequences of length `n`.

3. **Incorrect Construction of Missing Subsequence**:
   - When the program determines that not all subsequences are present, it constructs a missing subsequence incorrectly.
   - The construction of the missing subsequence does not guarantee that it is a valid subsequence that is not present in `s`.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `n` is greater than `k`, which means some characters might be missing entirely.
   - The program does not handle cases where `s` is very short compared to `n`, which means it cannot contain all possible subsequences of length `n`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
aa
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
bb
```

In this case, the program incorrectly identifies `bb` as a missing subsequence, but `aa` is the correct missing subsequence because `aa` does not occur as a subsequence in `abb`.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Generate all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each subsequence is present in `s`.
3. If all subsequences are present, print `YES`.
4. If any subsequence is not present, print `NO` and the missing subsequence.

Given the complexity of generating and checking all possible subsequences, a more efficient approach might be required, such as using dynamic programming or other combinatorial techniques to verify the presence of subsequences.
