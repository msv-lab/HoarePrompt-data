Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers where `n` and `k` are between 1 and 26, and `m` is between 1 and 1000; the string `s` is of length `m` and consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; the sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `m`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
