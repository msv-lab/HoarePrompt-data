The code snippet provided initializes a variable `count` to 0. This action does not affect the `expression` string or the `length` integer. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial state with the addition of the `count` variable being set to 0.

Output State: **expression is a string of length length consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is an integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000; `count` is 0.**
