### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

**Problem Understanding:**
The goal is to split the array derived from the string `s` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by the length of the subarray.

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Splitting the Expression:**
   - The code splits the string `expression` by the character `'-'` and calculates the length of the concatenated parts of the resulting list. This step is unnecessary and does not contribute to finding the minimum penalty. The variable `result_length` is calculated but not used in the function call.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates a count based on the balance of `'+'` and `'-'` characters in the string.
   - It initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is `'+'`, it increments the balance.
     - If the character is `'-'`, it decrements the balance.
     - If the balance becomes negative, it increments the count and resets the balance to 0.
   - After the loop, it adds 1 to the count if the balance is greater than 0.

**Correctness Analysis:**
- The logic in `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty. The function seems to be counting the number of times the balance goes negative and adding 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the penalty based on the absolute value of the sum of subarrays multiplied by their lengths.
- The program does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Instead, it uses a heuristic that does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

**Annotations:**
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the logic of `func_1`. However, they do not validate the correctness of the approach used to minimize the penalty.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Final: **False**
