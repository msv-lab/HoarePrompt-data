Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to split the array derived from the string `s` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by the length of the subarray.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Splitting the Expression**:
   - The program splits the string `expression` by the character `'-'` and calculates the length of the concatenated parts of the resulting list. This step is unnecessary and does not contribute to finding the minimum penalty.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates a count based on the balance of `'+'` and `'-'` characters in the string.
   - It initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is `'+'`, it increments the balance.
     - If the character is `'-'`, it decrements the balance.
     - If the balance becomes negative, it increments the count and resets the balance to 0.
   - After the loop, it adds 1 to the count if the balance is greater than 0.

### Correctness Analysis
- The logic in `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty. The function seems to be counting the number of times the balance goes negative and adding 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which is not the correct approach for minimizing the penalty.
- The penalty calculation should consider the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length, which is not handled in the given function.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
