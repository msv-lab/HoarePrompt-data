The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `y` (each with the same number of digits and consisting only of digits from 1 to 9) for each of `t` test cases. It ensures that the first integer `x` is lexicographically greater than or equal to the second integer `y` by swapping corresponding digits if necessary. The function then prints the modified `x` and the original `y` on separate lines for each test case.
