Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program first reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is done with `n = int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `n` times. For each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - For each set of integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, the program checks if they form a "STAIR" by verifying the condition `a < b < c`. If true, it prints "STAIR".
   - If the "STAIR" condition is not met, the program checks if they form a "PEAK" by verifying the condition `a < b > c`. If true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NONE".

4. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate string for each test case without returning any value.

The logic in the program directly corresponds to the conditions specified in the problem statement for determining if the digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or neither. Since the program correctly handles all possible cases and outputs the expected results as per the example provided, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
