The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines the winner of a game based on specific conditions involving the differences between the sorted unique stone counts. The result for each test case is printed, indicating either "Alice" or "Bob" as the winner.
