The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 4. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[3]`, and `i` is 4**
