The given code snippet performs a bitwise XOR operation on the variable `ans` with 1. The XOR operation with 1 flips the least significant bit of `ans`. Given that `ans` is initially 1, after the operation, `ans` will become 0.

Here is the output state with all the other variables remaining unchanged:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr`, sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is 1 or less.**
