The code snippet adds `0` at the beginning of the list `s`. This means that the list `s` which originally contained all unique, sorted elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element, now has `0` as its first element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and `s` is a sorted list containing `0` as its first element followed by all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element.**
