The given initial state provides information about several variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`, or `i`. The `print` statement is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **Alice**
