Postcondition: **`ans` is 1 if (n - 2) is even, `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr`, sorted in ascending order, `i` is equal to `n`. The current value of `ans` is 1.**
