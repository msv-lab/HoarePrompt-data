The code snippet adds the element at index `i` from the list `arr` to the set `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and the condition for `ans` remain unchanged. The only change is that the set `s` now includes the element `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a set containing `arr[i]`; If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if (n-2) is even, and `ans` is 0 if (n-2) is odd.**
