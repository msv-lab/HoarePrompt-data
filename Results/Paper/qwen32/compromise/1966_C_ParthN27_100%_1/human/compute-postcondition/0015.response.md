The value of `n` is updated to be the length of the list `s`. The list `s` contains `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order. Therefore, the new value of `n` is the count of elements in `s`. The other variables `t`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 1.**
