The code snippet `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans`. If `ans` was `0`, it becomes `1`; if `ans` was `1`, it becomes `0`. 

Given the initial state, the only change is in the value of `ans`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `i + 2`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is flipped (if `ans` was `0`, it is now `1`; if `ans` was `1`, it is now `0`). `ans` is flipped.**
