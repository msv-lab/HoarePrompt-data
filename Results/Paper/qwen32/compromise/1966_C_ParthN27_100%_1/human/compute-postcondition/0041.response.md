The code snippet `n = int(input())` will change the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided as input. The initial state specifies that `n` was the length of the list `s`. After this line of code is executed, `n` will no longer necessarily represent the length of `s` but will instead hold the value of the input integer. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order.**
