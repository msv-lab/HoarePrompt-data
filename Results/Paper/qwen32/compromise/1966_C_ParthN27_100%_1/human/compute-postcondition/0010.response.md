Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing all unique elements from `arr`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the set `s` will contain all the unique elements from the list `arr`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `arr` retains its original values.
