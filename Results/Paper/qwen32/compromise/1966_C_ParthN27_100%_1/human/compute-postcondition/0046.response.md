To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]`.

We need to adjust the state for the next iteration:
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the range of the loop.

Let's analyze the state:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`).
- Since the loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
- The variable `n` does not change, so it remains the same.
- The variables `t`, `arr`, and `s` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]`, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it by saying `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Given that we need to specify the exact state, and we know `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration (as an example, since `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue), the next value of `i` would be 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]`, and `i` is 3**

However, without the exact previous value of `i`, the most accurate general form is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**

For the sake of providing a concrete example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]`, and `i` is 3**

Let's assume `i` was 2:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]`, and `i` is 3**
