Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a set containing all unique elements from `arr`; If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if (n-2) is even, and `ans` is 0 if (n-2) is odd; `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the loop has finished executing.**

In simple terms, after the loop has finished executing, `s` will contain all unique elements from the list `arr`. The variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `t` and `ans` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions.
