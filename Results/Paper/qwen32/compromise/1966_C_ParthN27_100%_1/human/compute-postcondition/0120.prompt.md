Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    s.sort()
    s = [0] + s
    ans = 1
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans ^= 1
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order. If `n` is equal to 2, `s` contains `0` followed by a single unique element from `arr`. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if `n - 2` is odd or the loop did not break early, and `ans` is 0 if `n - 2` is even and the loop broke early.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing `0` as its first element followed by all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element. If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if (n-2) is even, and `ans` is 0 if (n-2) is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the length of `s`; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr`, sorted in ascending order; `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the loop has finished executing. If `n` equals 2, `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if (n - 2) is even, and `ans` is 0 if (n - 2) is odd.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
