Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pk = n // 2
    else:
        pk = n // 2
    sl = list(s)
    o = sl.count('1')
    z = sl.count('0')
    zero, one = 0, 0
    lst = []
    mini = pow(10, 8)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zero += 1
        else:
            one += 1
        zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
        one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
        if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
            lst.append(i + 1)
    for ele in lst:
        mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
    final = []
    for elem in lst:
        if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
            final.append(elem)
    final.sort()
    if len(final) == 0:
        c1 = o * 100 // n
        if c1 >= 50:
            final.append(0)
        else:
            final.append(n)
    print(final[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user such that there exists at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50% and has at least one element; `i` is `n - 2`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is updated to contain `[0]` if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is updated to contain `[n]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the new string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the original string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the original string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the original string `s`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, `i` is `n - 2`. If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a sorted list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` is a sorted list containing `[n]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `final` is sorted in ascending order, containing all indices from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is updated to `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` has a length of 1 and contains `n`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
