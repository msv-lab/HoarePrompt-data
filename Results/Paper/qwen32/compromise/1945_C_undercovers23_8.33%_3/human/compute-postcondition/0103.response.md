The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value less than `n - 1`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `n - 2`.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be `n - 2`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the new string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the original string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the original string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the original string `s` plus 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `mini` is `100000000`, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', otherwise `one` is incremented by 1, `lst` is `[n - 1, i + 1]` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains `[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`**
