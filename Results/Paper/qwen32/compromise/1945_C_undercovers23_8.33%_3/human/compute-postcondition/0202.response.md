The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `c1` based on the expression `o * 100 // n`. The variables `final`, `lst`, `pk`, `elem`, and `mini` remain unchanged as they are not referenced or modified in the given code snippet. The length of `final` remains 0.

Output State: **`final` is sorted in ascending order, containing all indices from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. Currently, the length of `final` is 0; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**
