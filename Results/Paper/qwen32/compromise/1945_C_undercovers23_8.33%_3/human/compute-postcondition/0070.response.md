Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user such that there exists at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50% and has at least one element; `i` is `n - 2`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is updated to contain `[0]` if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is updated to contain `[n]`.**
