The code sorts the list `final`. Therefore, the order of elements in `final` changes to be in ascending order. The condition that `final` contains all indices from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini` remains valid.

Output State: **`final` is sorted in ascending order, containing all indices from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
