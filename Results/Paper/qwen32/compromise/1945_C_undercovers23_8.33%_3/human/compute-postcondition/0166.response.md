The code snippet `one += 1` increments the value of the variable `one` by 1. The initial state mentions that `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Since the code only modifies the variable `one`, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `one` is increased by 1.**
