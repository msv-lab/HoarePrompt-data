The given code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. This means the previous value of `n` (which was an integer between 3 and 300,000) is overwritten by the new input value. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'.**
