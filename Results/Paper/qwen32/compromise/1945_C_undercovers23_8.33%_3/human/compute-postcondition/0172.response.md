To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `n`.

Here's the analysis:

- The loop runs for `i` in the range `n - 1`, meaning it starts at `i = 0` and goes up to `i = n - 2`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

No other variables in the loop head (`n`) need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**. 

Since we are only adjusting the state of the loop head variables, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `i_prev + 1`. However, since we don't have the specific value of `i_prev`, we express it generally as `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value.

So the final state is:
State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1**.
