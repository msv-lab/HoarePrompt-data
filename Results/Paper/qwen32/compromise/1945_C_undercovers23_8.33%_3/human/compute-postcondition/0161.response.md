Postcondition: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; If the character at index `i` of the string `s` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `(zero * 100) / (i + 1)` and `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `one_perc` is 0 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.** 

(Note: It's logically impossible for both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` to be simultaneously greater than or equal to 50 under the given conditions, but the postcondition reflects the literal interpretation of the if condition provided.)
