The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the current value of `elem` to the list `final`. This means that the list `final` now includes the element `elem`.

Given the initial state, `final` was either an empty list or contained `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. After executing the code, `final` will definitely contain `elem`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the new string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the original string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the original string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the original string `s`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `lst` contains at least one more index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, `i` is `n - 2`, `elem` is the next element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing `elem`.**
