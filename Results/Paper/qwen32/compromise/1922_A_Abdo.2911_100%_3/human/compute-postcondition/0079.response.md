The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `possible` to `True`. No other variables are modified in the given code. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `i` is `t + 1`, `possible` is `True`**.
