To determine the final output state after the loop completes all iterations, we need to understand the conditions under which the `possible` variable is set to `True` or remains `False`.

- The loop iterates over each character index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each index `i`:
  - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, the loop sets `possible` to `True` and breaks.
  - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]`, the loop sets `possible` to `True` and breaks.
  - Otherwise, the loop continues to the next index.

Given the information about the loop and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to iterate until one of the conditions that set `possible` to `True` is met or all iterations are completed.

### Final Output State:
- If the loop completes all iterations without setting `possible` to `True`, it means that for each index `i`:
  - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be equal to `a[i]`.
  - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

In this case, the final state of `possible` will be `False`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `possible` is `False`.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `possible` remains `False` if, for each index `i`, `c[i]` matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]` according to the specified conditions. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
