Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

**Initial State:**
- `t` is at least 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is an integer value provided by the user input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `possible` is `False` (though `possible` is not used in the provided code snippet).

**Python Code Snippet:**
```python
print('NO')
```

**Explanation:**
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `possible` are utilized in this statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables.

**Output:**
Output: **NO**
