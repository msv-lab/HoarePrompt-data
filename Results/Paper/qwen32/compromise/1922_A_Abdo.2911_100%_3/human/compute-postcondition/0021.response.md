The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and since the loop is about to start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is at least 1 (though `t` is not part of the loop head, it remains unchanged).
- `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each.
- The current index `i` has just finished its iteration, so it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is incremented by 1**
