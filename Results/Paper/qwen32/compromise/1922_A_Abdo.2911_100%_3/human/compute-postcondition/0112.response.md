Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 2. If `c[i] != a[i]`, then `possible` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` retains its original value.**
