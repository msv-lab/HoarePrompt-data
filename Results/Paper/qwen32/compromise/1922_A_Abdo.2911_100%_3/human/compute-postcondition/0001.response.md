The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters**
