The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted in terms of its value. However, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is `t - 1`, meaning that `t` has already been decremented. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 before the decrement happens.

Given that `t` is `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `t` must have been at least 1 before the decrement. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1 (since it will be decremented to 0, which is the last iteration).

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible`) do not change in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, and `possible` is either `True` or `False` based on the initial value of `possible`**.
