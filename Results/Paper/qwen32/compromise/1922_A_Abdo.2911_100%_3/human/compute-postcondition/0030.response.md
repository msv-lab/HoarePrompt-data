The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is 4** (assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, this would be adjusted accordingly based on the actual value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).

To generalize, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can represent the state as:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is incremented by 1**.

If we assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is 4**.

For the general case:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Given the previous iteration's `i` value was 3:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is 4**.

For the general case, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is `x + 1`**.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can represent the state as:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Given the previous iteration's `i` value was 3:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is 4**.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration, assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is 4**.

For the general case:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is 4**.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is 4**.

For the general case:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is incremented by 1**.
