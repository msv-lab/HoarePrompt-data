Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `i` is 3. If `a[3] == b[3]`, then if `c[3]` is not equal to `a[3]`, `possible` is `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `a[3] != b[3]`, then if `c[3]` is equal to `a[3]` or `c[3]` is equal to `b[3]`, the program continues as is. Otherwise, `possible` is set to `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
