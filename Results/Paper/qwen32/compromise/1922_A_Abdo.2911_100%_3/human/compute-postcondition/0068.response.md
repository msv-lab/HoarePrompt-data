Postcondition: **`t` is `t`, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `i` is `t`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `possible` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
