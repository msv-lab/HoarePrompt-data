The code snippet `c = input().strip()` takes a new input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns this value to the variable `c`. This means the previous value of `c` is overwritten by the new input.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
