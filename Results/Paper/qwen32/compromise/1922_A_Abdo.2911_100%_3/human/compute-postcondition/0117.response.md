Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`.**
