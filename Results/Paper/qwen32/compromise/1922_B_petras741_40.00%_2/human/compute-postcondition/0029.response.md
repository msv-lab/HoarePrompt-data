Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, `q[w[2]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` which are incremented by 1 respectively, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing a single index `j` from `0` to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is 1.**

In simple terms: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `buffer` is an empty list. `n` is an input integer that is at least 3, and `w` is a list of integers from the input. `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, except for the indices specified in `w`, which are incremented by 1. `j` is equal to `n`, and `eta` is a list containing exactly one index `j` where `q[j]` is greater than 0. The length of `eta` (`eta_ln`) is 1, and `rho` is 1.
