Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer and at least 2, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list where each index `k` has a value equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`, `j` is 3. If `q[2]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the values [2, 3]. Otherwise, `eta` is a list containing the value [3]. If `q[j]` (which is `q[3]`) is greater than 0, `eta` will also include the value 3, making it [2, 3] if `q[2]` is greater than 0, or simply [3] if `q[2]` is not greater than 0. If `q[j]` is not greater than 0, `eta` remains unchanged from its initial state based on `q[2]`.**
