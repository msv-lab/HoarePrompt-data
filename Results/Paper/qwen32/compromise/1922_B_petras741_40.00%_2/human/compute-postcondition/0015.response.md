Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[0]]` which is incremented by 1, `q[w[1]]` which is incremented by 1, `q[w[2]]` which is incremented by 1, and so on until `q[w[n-1]]` which is incremented by 1, `j` is n-1, `eta` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `eta` is initialized as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values as no other changes are made to them in the provided code snippet.
