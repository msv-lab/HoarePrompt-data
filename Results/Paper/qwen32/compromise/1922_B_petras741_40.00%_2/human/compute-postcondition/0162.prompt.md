Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w`, `eta` is a list containing all unique integers from the list `w`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `eta_ln` is not equal to 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]
    if j > 1000:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w`, `eta` is a list containing all unique integers from the list `w`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` and is not equal to 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[1]]`, `res` is updated to `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `j` is 1. If `j` is greater than 1000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w`, `eta` is a list containing all unique integers from the list `w`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` and is not equal to 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[1]] + q[eta[j]]`, `res` is updated to the initial `res` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than 1000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w`, `eta` is a list containing all unique integers from the list `w`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` and is not equal to 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[1]] + q[eta[2]] + q[eta[3]]`, `res` is updated to the initial `res` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `j` is 3. If `j` is greater than 1000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as per the original conditions without any modifications to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
