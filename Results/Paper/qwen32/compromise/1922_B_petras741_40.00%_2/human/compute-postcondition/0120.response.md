The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is now 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 3, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[j]]` which is 1, `j` is 3**
