Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list where each index `k` has a value equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`, `eta` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n + 1):
    if q[j] > 0:
        eta.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0), `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list where each index `k` has a value equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list where each index `k` has a value equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`, `j` is 2. If `q[2]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the value 2. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer and at least 2, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list where each index `k` has a value equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`, `j` is 3. If `q[2]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the values [2, 3]. Otherwise, `eta` is a list containing the value [3]. If `q[j]` (which is `q[3]`) is greater than 0, `eta` will also include the value 3, making it [2, 3] if `q[2]` is greater than 0, or simply [3] if `q[2]` is not greater than 0. If `q[j]` is not greater than 0, `eta` remains unchanged from its initial state based on `q[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
