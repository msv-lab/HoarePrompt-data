Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input, `d` is the value of the string input by the user, `e` is the value of the user input, `j` is `b`, `k` is `b + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of all the variables remain unchanged, but the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
