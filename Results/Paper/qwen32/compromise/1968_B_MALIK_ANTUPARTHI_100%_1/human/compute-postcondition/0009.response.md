Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the value of the user input, `e` is the value of the user input, `k` is the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 added to the original `k`. The current value of `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`.**
