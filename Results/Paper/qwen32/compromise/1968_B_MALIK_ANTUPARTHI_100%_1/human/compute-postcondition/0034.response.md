To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the value of `k` is determined.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` and `b` are integers greater than 0.
- `c` is an integer.
- `d` is the value of the user input.
- `e` is the value of the user input.
- `k` is the value determined by a loop's breaking condition:
  - The loop breaks when:
    - `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`.
    - `k` reaches `c`.
    - `j` reaches `b - 1`.

### Analysis:
The value of `k` is determined by a loop that involves iterating through some lists or arrays `d` and `e`. However, the exact nature of the loop and the conditions under which `k` is updated or the loop breaks are not provided in the initial state. Without the loop code, we can only describe the possible values of `k` based on the given conditions.

### Possible Values of `k`:
1. **When `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`**: `k` will be the index where the search stopped.
2. **When `k` reaches `c`**: `k` will be equal to `c`.
3. **When `j` reaches `b - 1`**: `k` will be the value it had at the end of the loop.

### Output Description:
Since the exact loop and conditions are not provided, we can't determine the precise numerical value of `k`. However, we can describe `k` in terms of the loop's breaking conditions.

Output: **k (where k is determined by the loop's breaking condition: either `j + 1` when `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` reaches `c`, or `j` reaches `b - 1`)**
