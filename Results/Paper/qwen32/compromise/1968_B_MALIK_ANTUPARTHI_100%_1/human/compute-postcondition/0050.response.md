Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input, `d` is the value of the string input by the user, `e` is the value of the user input. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, `k` is updated to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `k`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to the value of `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
