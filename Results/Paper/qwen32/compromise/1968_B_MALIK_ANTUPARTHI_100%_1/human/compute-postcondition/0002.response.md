The provided code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `b` and `c` after converting them to integers. This means the original binary string `b` is replaced by an integer value, and a new variable `c` is introduced with an integer value from the input.

Given the initial state, `b` was a binary string of length `m`, and now it will hold an integer value. The variable `c` is newly introduced and will hold the second integer value from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer**.
