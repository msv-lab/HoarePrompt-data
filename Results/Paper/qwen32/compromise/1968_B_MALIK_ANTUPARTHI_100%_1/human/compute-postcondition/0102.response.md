Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Explanation:
1. **j** is defined as `b - 1`.
2. **k** is defined based on a condition:
   - If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is set to `b`.
   - Otherwise, `k` is set to the value of `j` where `d[j]` was not found in `e[k:]`.

### Key Points:
- `j` is explicitly defined as `b - 1`.
- The value of `k` depends on the condition:
  - If either `k == c` or `j == b - 1` is true, then `k` is set to `b`.
  - Otherwise, `k` is set to `j` where `d[j]` was not found in `e[k:]`.

### Condition Analysis:
- Since `j` is defined as `b - 1`, the condition `j == b - 1` is always true.
- Therefore, the condition `k == c or j == b - 1` will always be true because `j == b - 1` is always true.
- As a result, `k` is always set to `b`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the condition `j == b - 1` is always true, `k` will always be set to `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **b**
