To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions.

The loop iterates over the range of `b` (the first integer from the input). The loop variable `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. The variable `k` is initially set to 0 and can be updated based on the conditions inside the loop.

Here's a summary of the loop's behavior:
1. For each iteration, the loop checks if `d[j]` is in the sublist `e[k:]`.
2. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to the position of `d[j]` in `e` starting from index `k` plus 1, plus `k`.
3. If `k` equals `c` (the second integer from the input) or `j` equals `b - 1` (the last iteration), `k` is set to `j + 1`, and the loop breaks.
4. If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to `j`, and the loop breaks.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After 1 iteration: `j` is 0, `k` is 1 if `d[0]` is in `e[k-1:]` and either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. Otherwise, `k` remains 0.
- After 2 iterations: `j` is 1, `k` is updated based on the presence of `d[1]` in `e[k:]` and the conditions mentioned.
- After 3 iterations: `j` is 2, `k` is updated based on the presence of `d[2]` in `e[k:]` and the conditions mentioned.

The loop will continue until one of the following conditions is met:
- `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, and `k` is set to `j`.
- `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, and `k` is set to `j + 1`.

The final output state will be when the loop terminates, which means either `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]` for some `j`, or `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.

Let's consider the possible final states:
- If the loop breaks because `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]` for some `j`, then `k` will be set to `j`.
- If the loop breaks because `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` will be set to `j + 1`.

Since the loop iterates `b` times, the final value of `j` will be `b - 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early. In this case, `k` will be set to `b` if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.

Therefore, the final output state is:
- `j` is `b - 1`.
- `k` is `b` if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is the value of `j` where `d[j]` was not found in `e[k:]`.

Given the above, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`j` is `b - 1`, `k` is `b` if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, otherwise `k` is the value of `j` where `d[j]` was not found in `e[k:]`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will end when it either completes all iterations (`j` is `b - 1` and `k` is `b` if the conditions are met) or when `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]` for some `j`, setting `k` to that `j`.
