The code snippet `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` by setting it to `j + 1`. Given that `j` is equal to `b`, the new value of `k` will be `b + 1`.

The initial state specifies the following:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is an integer greater than 0.
- `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 0.
- `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input.
- `d` is the value of the string input by the user.
- `e` is the value of the user input.
- `j` is `b`.
- `k` is the position in `e` of the character `d[j]` starting from the original `k` position, plus 1.

After the execution of `k = j + 1`, the value of `k` is updated, but all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input, `d` is the value of the string input by the user, `e` is the value of the user input, `j` is `b`, `k` is `b + 1`.**
