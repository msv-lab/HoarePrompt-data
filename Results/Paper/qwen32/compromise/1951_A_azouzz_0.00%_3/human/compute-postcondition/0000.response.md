The code snippet assigns the value of an integer input to a new variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`. The variable `t` is introduced with the value of the input, but there is no impact on `start` and `end`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer.**
