The code calculates the value of `not_mid` as `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(right - left + 1) // 2`, we can substitute and simplify:

`not_mid = right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2`

This means `not_mid` will be the complement of `mid` in the range from `left` to `right` inclusive.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number for the vertices in the range from left to right, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.**
