Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number for the vertices in the range from left to right, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are set to `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all set to `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[right]` are set to `big_element - 1` to `big_element - not_mid` respectively, `cliquess[left + mid]` to `cliquess[right]` are all set to `clique`.**
