The function `make_array` modifies two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, for a specified range of indices from `left` to `right`. It sets the first half of the range in `arr` to increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half to decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. It also assigns the `clique` value to all entries in the `cliquess` array for the same range.
