Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Understanding the Problem
The problem requires us to:
1. Assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
2. Create edges between vertices (i, j) if the condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k is satisfied.
3. Partition the resulting graph into the minimum number of cliques.
4. Output the assignment of integers, the number of cliques, and the partition of the graph into cliques.

### Analyzing the Provided Code

#### Function `func_1(n, k)`
- This function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
- It initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` to store the assigned values and clique identifiers, respectively.
- It then calls `make_array` for each segment of the array, dividing the vertices into segments of size up to `k`.

#### Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`
- This function assigns values to the vertices in the range from `left` to `right` and assigns them to the specified `clique`.
- It divides the range into two parts: a smaller part and a larger part.
- It assigns values from the smaller part in ascending order and values from the larger part in descending order.

### Issues with the Provided Code

1. **Global Variable Usage:**
   - The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. This is not defined within the functions and can lead to errors or unexpected behavior if the code is used in a different context.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Clique Number:**
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`. However, this is not necessarily the minimum number of cliques required. The problem requires partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques, which might not always be `ceil(n / k)`.

3. **Edge Condition Handling:**
   - The code does not ensure that the graph formed by the assignments satisfies the edge condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k for all pairs (i, j) within the same clique.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is not correctly handled. The function `func_1` prints the results directly, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases as required.

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not guarantee that the output will be correct for all test cases. Specifically, the calculation of the number of cliques and the assignment of values to vertices do not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

**Correctness: False**
