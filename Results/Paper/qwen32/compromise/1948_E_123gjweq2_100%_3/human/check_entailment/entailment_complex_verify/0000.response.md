### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, the annotations, and the original assessment.

1. **Global Variables**: 
   - The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. This is indeed problematic because these variables are not re-initialized for each test case. This means that results from one test case can carry over to the next, leading to incorrect outputs. Variables should be passed as parameters or re-initialized within the scope of each test case.

2. **Initialization of Arrays**:
   - The program initializes `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros. However, the problem requires `arr` to contain distinct integers from 1 to n. The program does not ensure this. Specifically, the function `make_array` does not fill `arr` with distinct integers from 1 to n; instead, it fills segments of `arr` with increasing and decreasing sequences, which do not necessarily cover all integers from 1 to n.

3. **Logic for Array Construction**:
   - The logic in `make_array` for filling `arr` and `cliquess` does not ensure that the values in `arr` are distinct integers from 1 to n. The function fills the first half of the range in `arr` with increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. This approach does not guarantee that all integers from 1 to n are used exactly once in `arr`. Additionally, the function does not handle the edge condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` correctly.

4. **Edge Condition Handling**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the edge conditions for the graph construction. The condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is not correctly implemented in the logic of `make_array`. The function does not ensure that the values in `arr` result in a graph that can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the results directly within the function, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases. The results should be collected and printed after processing all test cases.

### Example of a Case Where the Program Fails:

Let's consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`.

- The program initializes `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
- The function `make_array` attempts to fill these arrays but does not ensure that `arr` contains distinct integers from 1 to 5.
- The logic for partitioning the graph into cliques based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is not correctly implemented.

For `n = 5` and `k = 4`, a correct solution could be:
- `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `cliques = 1`
- `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

This is because with `arr` being a simple sequence from 1 to 5, the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices, and thus, all vertices can be in the same clique.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements and fails to produce the correct output for at least one test case. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
