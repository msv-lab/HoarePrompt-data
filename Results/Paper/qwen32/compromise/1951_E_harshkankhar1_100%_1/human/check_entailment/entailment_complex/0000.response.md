### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if a given string can be partitioned into substrings where none of the substrings are palindromes. Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If it's not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts `k` (which is 1 in this case), and the string `s` itself as the single part.
   - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it finds the index `x` of the first character that is different from the first character of the string.
   - If no such character exists (`x == -1`), it means all characters in the string are the same, and thus, it's impossible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings. It prints "NO".
   - If such a character exists, it checks if the substring starting from `x + 1` to the end of the string is not a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts `k` (which is 2 in this case), and the two parts: the substring from the start to `x + 1` and the substring from `x + 1` to the end.
   - If the substring starting from `x + 1` to the end of the string is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`. If `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because it's not possible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings in this case.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of parts `k` (which is 2 in this case), and the two parts: the substring from the start to `x + 2` and the substring from `x + 2` to the end.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Case 1**: If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, the program correctly identifies this and outputs "YES" with the entire string as the single part.
- **Case 2**: If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, the program correctly identifies this and attempts to find a partition.
  - If all characters are the same, it correctly outputs "NO".
  - If there is a character different from the first character, it checks the substring starting from the next character. If this substring is not a palindrome, it correctly outputs "YES" with two parts.
  - If the substring starting from the next character is a palindrome, it further checks the position of `x` to determine if a valid partition is possible. If not, it outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the given conditions and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
