Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `r` is the string representation of `a[x]` concatenated with itself twice, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is incremented by 2, `i` is the next element in `s`**

The value of `b[x]` has been increased by 1 twice, so it is incremented by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
