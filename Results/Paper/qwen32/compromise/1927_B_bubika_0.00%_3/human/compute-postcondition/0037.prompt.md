Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers where each element represents the count of the corresponding element in `s`, `r` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of integers where each element represents the count of the corresponding element in `s` and `b[x]` has been incremented by 1, `r` is a string that now includes `a[x]`, and a `NameError` is raised because `i` is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of integers where each element represents the count of the corresponding element in `s` and `b[x]` is now `b[x] + 1`, `r` is a string that includes the string representation of the original `b[x]`, `i` is the first element of `s`, `x` is the index of the count of the first element of `s` in the list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of integers where each element represents the count of the corresponding element in `s` and `b[x]` is now `b[x] + 2`, `r` is a string that includes the string representation of the original `b[x]` followed by `a[x]`, `i` is the second element of `s`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
