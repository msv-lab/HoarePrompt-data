Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `s` of `n` integers. It then constructs and prints a string `r` by mapping each integer in `s` to a corresponding character in the alphabet, where each integer `i` in `s` maps to the character at index `i` in the list `b`, and `b` keeps track of the count of each integer encountered across all test cases. The final output for each test case is the constructed string `r`.**
