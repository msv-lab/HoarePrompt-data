Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `r` is the string representation of `a[x]` concatenated with itself, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1, `i` is the last element in `s`. The value of `b[x]` has been increased by 1.**

In simple terms, the value at the index `x` of the list `b` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
