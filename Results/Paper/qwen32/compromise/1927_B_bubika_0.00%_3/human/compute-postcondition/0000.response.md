The code snippet `a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` assigns the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` to the variable `a`. This overwrites the previous value of `a`, which was a list of `n` integers. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
