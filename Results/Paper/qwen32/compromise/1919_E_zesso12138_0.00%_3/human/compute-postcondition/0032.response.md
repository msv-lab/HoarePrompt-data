In this case, the loop iterates over the elements in the `results` list. The loop head only contains the variable `res`, which represents each element in the `results` list during each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is 1
- `index` is `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, t+1))`
- `results` is a list containing 1 element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in the iteration
- `n` and `p` are the values used in the last iteration

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses. Since the loop iterates over `results`, the next iteration would require another element in the `results` list for `res` to iterate over.

However, the provided loop does not modify or add elements to the `results` list within its body (as it's omitted). Therefore, based on the given information, there is no way for the loop to execute another iteration because `results` only contains one element.

If we were to assume that the loop body modifies `results` to add more elements, we would need additional information about how `results` is modified. But based on the current information, the loop cannot execute another iteration.

Thus, the state remains the same as the end of the previous iteration since there are no more elements in `results` to iterate over.

State: **`t` is 1, `index` is `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, t+1))`, `results` is a list containing 1 element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in the iteration, `n` and `p` are the values used in the last iteration**
