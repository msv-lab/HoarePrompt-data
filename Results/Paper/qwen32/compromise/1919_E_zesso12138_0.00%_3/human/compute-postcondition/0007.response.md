The code snippet assigns the value of `int(data[index])` to `n`. Given the initial state, `index` is 1, so `n` will be updated to the integer value of `data[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `p` is a list of integers of length `n`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
