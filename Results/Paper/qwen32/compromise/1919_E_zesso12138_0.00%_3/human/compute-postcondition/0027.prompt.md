Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `index` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(n, p)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `result`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0] - 1`; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is `int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + 2*int(data[3 + 2*old_n]) + 1 + int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing three elements, the first two of which are the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`, and the third is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
