Postcondition: **`dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except for `dp[j]` which is greater than 0. `new_dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except for `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `dp[j] % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Additionally, if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_dp[j - 1]` is `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. `i` is `n - 1`, and `n` must be at least 0.**
