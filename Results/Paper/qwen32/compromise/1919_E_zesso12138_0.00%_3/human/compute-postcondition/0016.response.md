The given code snippet updates the list `p` by mapping the elements from `data[index:index + n]` to integers. Here's the updated state:

- `n` remains the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.
- `p` is now a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `data` remains a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer.
- `index` remains `3 + n`.
- `t` remains the integer value of `data[0] - 1`.
- `results` remains a list containing one element, which is the value of `result`.
- `result` remains the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`.

Since `p` is reassigned, its new value is the list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0] - 1`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `result`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**.
