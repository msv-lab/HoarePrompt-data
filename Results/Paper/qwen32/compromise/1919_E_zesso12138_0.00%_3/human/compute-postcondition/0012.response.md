The code appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `result`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**.
