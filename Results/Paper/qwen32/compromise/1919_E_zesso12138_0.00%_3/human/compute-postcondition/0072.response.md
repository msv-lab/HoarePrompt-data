Postcondition: **`dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`. `new_dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1` except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `((dp[j]) % MOD + (dp[j]) % MOD) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `dp[j] > 0`. `new_dp[j - 1]` is `((dp[j]) % MOD + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `dp[j] > 0`. `i` is 2, `n` is at least 0, and `j` is 2. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated as specified. Otherwise, `new_dp` remains unchanged except for the values already set according to the initial conditions.**
