Output State: **`dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `dp` is updated to be the same as `new_dp`, which is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`. The precondition that `new_dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1` remains valid, and now `dp` also holds the same value.
