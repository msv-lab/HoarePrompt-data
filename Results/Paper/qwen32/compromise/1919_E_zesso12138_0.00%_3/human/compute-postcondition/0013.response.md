The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is an underscore indicating that it is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`
- `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`
- `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer
- `index` is `2 + n`
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`
- `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `result`
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 because the loop iterates `t` times.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0] - 1`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `result`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**
