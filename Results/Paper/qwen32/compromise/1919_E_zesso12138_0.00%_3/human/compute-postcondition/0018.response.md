The given code snippet reassigns the value of `result` by calling the function `func_1(n, p)`. This means the new value of `result` will be whatever `func_1(n, p)` returns. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged unless they are directly modified within `func_1`, which is not indicated in the provided code snippet.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact value that `result` will take. However, we can state that `result` will be updated to the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

The `results` list, which initially contains one element (the old value of `result`), will now contain this new value of `result`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0] - 1`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**.
