To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is just `j` in this case. The loop iterates over the range `2 * n + 1`, so `j` will increment by 1 at the start of each new iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`.
- `new_dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1` except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `(dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Additionally, if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_dp[j - 1]` is also `(dp[j]) % MOD`.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is at least 0.
- If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, the above updates to `new_dp` occur.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have taken on some value, and since we are now starting the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume it was `j` and now it will be `j + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `dp` remains the same (a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`).
- `new_dp` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the next iteration hasn't yet modified it.
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains at least 0.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1` except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `(dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Additionally, if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_dp[j - 1]` is also `(dp[j]) % MOD`. `i` is 2, `n` is at least 0, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
