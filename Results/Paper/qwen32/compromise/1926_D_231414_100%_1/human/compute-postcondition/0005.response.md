The code snippet creates a new dictionary named `dic`. The values of `times`, `n`, and `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 <= `times` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `dic` is an empty dictionary.**
