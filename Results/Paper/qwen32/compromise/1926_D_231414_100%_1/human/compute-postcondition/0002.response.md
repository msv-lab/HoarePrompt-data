The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `times`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The other variables (`t`, `n`, the list of integers, and `check`) do not affect the execution of the loop itself, only the operations within the loop body.

Given the condition that `times` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), to ensure the loop executes, `times` must be at least 1.

State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 <= `times` <= 10^4**
