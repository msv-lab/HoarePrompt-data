The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it depends on the length of `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one integer, which ensures that `len(arr)` is greater than 0. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts is not explicitly required to be set since it will be initialized by the `range` function in the loop head. However, to be clear about the state, we can specify that `i` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 0**
