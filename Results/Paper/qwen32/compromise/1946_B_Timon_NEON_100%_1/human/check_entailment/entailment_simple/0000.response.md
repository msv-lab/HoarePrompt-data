### Reasoning:

Let's break down the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. In each operation, you can select any contiguous subarray and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. The final sum must be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Key Points:
1. **Maximizing the Sum**: To maximize the sum, we should always add the sum of the maximum contiguous subarray. This is because adding a positive sum will increase the total sum, and adding a negative sum will decrease it.
2. **Multiple Operations**: Since we can perform up to `k` operations, the optimal strategy is to always add the maximum subarray sum. If the maximum subarray sum is positive, we can keep adding it multiple times.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The result must be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

#### Program Analysis:
The given program consists of three functions:
1. **func_1(number)**: This function returns the remainder of `number` divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
2. **func_2(arr)**: This function is supposed to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum and its indices. However, there are issues with its implementation:
   - The logic for finding the maximum subarray sum is flawed. It does not correctly implement Kadane's algorithm or any other standard method to find the maximum subarray sum.
   - The function does not handle all edge cases properly, such as arrays with all negative numbers.
3. **func_3(number, quantity)**: This function is not used in the provided code snippet.

#### Issues in `func_2`:
- The function does not correctly identify the maximum subarray sum. It incorrectly handles the case where all elements are negative.
- The function does not return the correct maximum subarray sum in all cases, leading to incorrect results.

#### Correctness Check:
Given the issues in `func_2`, the program cannot correctly determine the maximum subarray sum in all cases, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of `func_2`.

**Correctness: False**
