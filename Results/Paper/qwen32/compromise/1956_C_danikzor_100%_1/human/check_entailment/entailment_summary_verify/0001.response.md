### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided program systematically using the function summary and the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve filling a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

#### Key Observations

1. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to place the largest possible numbers in as many cells as possible.
   - The maximum possible number in the matrix is \( n \), and we want each number from 1 to \( n \) to appear as many times as possible.

2. **Operations**:
   - **Type 1 Operation**: Fill a row with a permutation.
   - **Type 2 Operation**: Fill a column with a permutation.
   - We have up to \( 2n \) operations available.

#### Strategy

The optimal strategy involves filling the rows and columns with permutations that maximize the sum. One effective way to achieve this is to use Type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) and then use Type 2 operations to fill each column with the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\). This ensures that each row and each column is filled with the largest possible numbers.

#### Verification

Let's verify the provided program against this strategy:

1. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
   - The number of operations is set to \( 2n \).

2. **Operations**:
   - The program performs Type 1 operations on each row from 1 to \( n \), filling each row with the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).
   - The program then performs Type 2 operations on each column from 1 to \( n \), filling each column with the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).

#### Example Verification

For \( n = 2 \):
- The maximum sum is \( \frac{2(2+1)(4 \cdot 2 - 1)}{6} = 7 \).
- The operations are:
  - Type 1 on row 1: [2, 1]
  - Type 1 on row 2: [2, 1]
  - Type 2 on column 1: [2, 2]
  - Type 2 on column 2: [1, 1]
- The resulting matrix is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 \\
  2 & 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- The sum is \(2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6\), which is incorrect based on the problem's example. However, the correct operations should be:
  - Type 1 on row 1: [2, 1]
  - Type 1 on row 2: [1, 2]
  - Type 2 on column 1: [2, 1]
  - Type 2 on column 2: [1, 2]
- The resulting matrix is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 2 \\
  1 & 2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- The sum is \(2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7\), which is correct.

#### Correct Approach

The correct approach involves filling rows and columns with permutations that ensure each cell is filled with the largest possible numbers. The program provided does not correctly achieve this because it fills rows and columns with the same permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) for both, which does not maximize the sum correctly.

#### Conclusion

The program's logic is flawed because it does not maximize the sum correctly. The correct approach should involve filling rows and columns with permutations that ensure the sum is maximized, such as filling rows with \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) and columns with \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\), or vice versa.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
