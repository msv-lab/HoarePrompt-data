To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure it satisfies the problem description for all potential input cases, including edge cases. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with zeroes.
2. We can perform two types of operations:
   - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \). Set \( a_{i, j} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
   - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \). Set \( a_{j, i} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
3. The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
4. The output should include the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the details of each operation.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases \( t \), and for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \). It then outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

#### Output Analysis:
- The maximum sum is calculated as \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
- The number of operations is \( 2n \).

#### Operations Analysis:
- For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \):
  - Perform a Type 1 operation setting the row \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
  - Perform a Type 2 operation setting the column \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

### Verification:
1. **Max Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is the sum of the first \( n \) triangular numbers, which is the correct formula for the maximum sum achievable with the given operations. This is because each row and column gets filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), effectively placing the highest possible numbers in the matrix.

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \). This is a valid strategy because it maximizes the sum by placing the largest numbers in the matrix.
   - The number of operations \( 2n \) is within the allowed limit.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **\( n = 1 \)**: The matrix is \( 1 \times 1 \). The maximum sum is 1, and the operation is to set the single element to 1.
   - **\( n = 2 \)**: The matrix is \( 2 \times 2 \). The maximum sum is 7, and the operations are as described in the example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum for any \( n \). It handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) and provides a valid sequence of \( 2n \) operations to achieve this sum. It handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem constraints.
