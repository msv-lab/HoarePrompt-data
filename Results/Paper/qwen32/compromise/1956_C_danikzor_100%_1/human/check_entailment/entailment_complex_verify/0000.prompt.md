You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), which represents the size of the n × n matrix a. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the size of the n × n matrix)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: For each test case with input `n`, the output consists of `2 * n` lines, each line starting with either `1` or `2`, followed by the current `i` value, and then the sequence of numbers from `n` down to `1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an `n × n` matrix. For each test case, it prints a specific mathematical result and then prints `2 * n` lines, each starting with either `1` or `2`, followed by the current row number and a sequence of numbers from `n` down to `1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure it satisfies the problem description for all potential input cases, including edge cases. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with zeroes.
2. We can perform two types of operations:
   - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \). Set \( a_{i, j} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
   - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \). Set \( a_{j, i} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
3. The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
4. The output should include the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the details of each operation.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases \( t \), and for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \). It then outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

#### Output Analysis:
- The maximum sum is calculated as \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
- The number of operations is \( 2n \).

#### Operations Analysis:
- For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \):
  - Perform a Type 1 operation setting the row \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
  - Perform a Type 2 operation setting the column \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

### Verification:
1. **Max Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is the sum of the first \( n \) triangular numbers, which is the correct formula for the maximum sum achievable with the given operations. This is because each row and column gets filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), effectively placing the highest possible numbers in the matrix.

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \). This is a valid strategy because it maximizes the sum by placing the largest numbers in the matrix.
   - The number of operations \( 2n \) is within the allowed limit.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **\( n = 1 \)**: The matrix is \( 1 \times 1 \). The maximum sum is 1, and the operation is to set the single element to 1.
   - **\( n = 2 \)**: The matrix is \( 2 \times 2 \). The maximum sum is 7, and the operations are as described in the example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum for any \( n \). It handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) and provides a valid sequence of \( 2n \) operations to achieve this sum. It handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem constraints.
