The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an `n Ã— n` matrix. For each test case, it prints a specific mathematical result and then prints `2 * n` lines, each starting with either `1` or `2`, followed by the current row number and a sequence of numbers from `n` down to `1`.
