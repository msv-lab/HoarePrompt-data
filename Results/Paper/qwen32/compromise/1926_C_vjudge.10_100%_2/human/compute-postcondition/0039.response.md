To determine what will be printed by the `print(values[value])` statement, we need to understand the initial state and the construction of the `values` list.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: A non-negative integer (i.e., `t >= 0`).
2. **`inf`**: A constant integer value set to 200001.
3. **`values`**: A list of 200001 elements initialized to 0, except for the last element (`values[200000]`), which is set to `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `200000`.
4. **`value`**: An input integer.

### Construction of `values[200000]`:
- The last element of the `values` list, `values[200000]`, is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{values}[200000] = t + \sum_{i=1}^{200000} \text{(sum of digits of } i\text{)}
  \]
- The cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `200000` is a fixed value that can be computed based on the properties of digit sums in a range.

### Determining the Output:
- The `print(values[value])` statement will print the element at the index `value` in the `values` list.
- Since `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except for the last element, the output will depend on the value of `value`:
  - If `value` is any integer from `0` to `199999`, the output will be `0` because `values[value]` is `0` for these indices.
  - If `value` is `200000`, the output will be `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `200000`.

### Final Output Description:
- If `value` is `200000`, the output will be `t + \sum_{i=1}^{200000} \text{(sum of digits of } i\text{)}`.
- If `value` is any other integer from `0` to `199999`, the output will be `0`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be `0` if `value` is any integer from `0` to `199999`. If `value` is `200000`, the output will be `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `200000`.

Output: **0 if value is between 0 and 199999, otherwise t + sum of digits of all numbers from 1 to 200000 (where t is the given non-negative integer and the sum of digits is the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200000)**
