To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and what changes occur in each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each digit of the integer `i` and adds that digit to `sum_value_digits`. The value of `i` is not explicitly updated in the provided loop, but based on the given output states, it seems that `i` increments after each loop iteration.

### Given Data:
- **Initial State:**
  - `t`: input integer (number of test cases)
  - `inf`: constant 200001
  - `values`: list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t`
  - `i`: starts at 2
  - `sum_value_digits`: starts at 0

### Iteration Analysis:
- **After 1st iteration:**
  - `i` is 2
  - `sum_value_digits` becomes `2` (since the string representation of 2 is "2")
- **After 2nd iteration:**
  - `i` is still 2 (as per the given state, but it seems it should increment)
  - `sum_value_digits` becomes `4` (as per the given state, but it seems it should reset for each `i` increment)
- **After 3rd iteration:**
  - `i` increments to 3
  - `sum_value_digits` resets and becomes `3` (since the string representation of 3 is "3")

Based on the pattern observed, `i` should increment after each iteration, and `sum_value_digits` should reset and sum the digits of the new `i`.

### Final Output State:
Given that `i` starts at 2 and increments each iteration, and the loop runs until a certain condition is met (which is not explicitly stated but implied by the context), we need to determine the exact stopping point. Since the problem does not specify the stopping condition, we will assume the loop runs until `i` reaches a point where further iterations do not change `sum_value_digits` significantly or based on the context, until a predefined number of iterations.

However, if we assume the loop runs until `i` reaches `inf` (200001), we can calculate the final `sum_value_digits` by summing the digits of each `i` from 2 to 200001.

### Calculation:
To find the final `sum_value_digits`, we need to sum the digits of each number from 2 to 200001. This is a complex calculation, but we can simplify by understanding that the sum of digits of numbers in a range can be computed systematically.

For simplicity, let's assume the loop runs until `i` reaches a point where the sum of digits stabilizes or a predefined number of iterations is met. Given the context, we can assume the loop runs until `i` reaches 200001.

The exact sum of digits from 2 to 200001 can be computed programmatically, but for the sake of this problem, we will assume the final `sum_value_digits` is the sum of digits of numbers from 2 to 200001.

### Final Output State:
- `t`: remains the input integer (number of test cases)
- `inf`: remains 200001
- `values`: remains a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t`
- `i`: reaches 200001 (or the stopping condition is met)
- `sum_value_digits`: sum of digits of numbers from 2 to 200001

Given the problem constraints and the need for a simplified answer, we can assume the final `sum_value_digits` is a large number, but for the sake of the problem, we will denote it as `final_sum_value_digits`.

Output State: **t is an input integer representing the number of test cases, inf is 200001, values is a list of 200001 zeros except values[1] which is t, i is 200001, sum_value_digits is final_sum_value_digits.**

In natural language: The final output state is that `t` remains the input integer, `inf` remains 200001, `values` remains mostly zeros with `values[1]` being `t`, `i` reaches 200001, and `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 2 to 200001.
