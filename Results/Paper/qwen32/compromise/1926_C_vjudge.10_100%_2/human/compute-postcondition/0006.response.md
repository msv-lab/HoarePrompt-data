The code snippet `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increments the variable `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. The other variables (`t`, `inf`, `values`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Given that `sum_value_digits` was initially 0, after executing the code, `sum_value_digits` will be equal to `int(x)`. The values of `t`, `inf`, `values`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1, `sum_value_digits` is `int(x)`**.
