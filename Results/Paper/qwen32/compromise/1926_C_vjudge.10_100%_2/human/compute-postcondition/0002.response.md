The code snippet initializes a list named `values` with 200001 elements, all set to 0. The value of `t` (the number of test cases) and `inf` (which is 200001) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.**
