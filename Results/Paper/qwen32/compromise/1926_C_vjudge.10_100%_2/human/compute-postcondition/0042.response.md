To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: It is given that `t` is greater than 0.
2. **`inf`**: It is set to 200001.
3. **`values`**: This is a list of 200001 zeros. However, the element at index 200000 is set to `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200000.
4. **`value`**: This is an input integer.

### Calculation of `values[200000]`:
- The cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200000 needs to be calculated.
- Let's denote this cumulative sum as `digit_sum`.

### The `print` Statement:
- The code snippet is `print(values[value])`.
- The value to be printed depends on the value of `value`.

### Cases:
1. **If `value` is 200000**:
   - `values[200000]` is `t + digit_sum`.
   - Therefore, the output will be `t + digit_sum`.

2. **If `value` is any other integer between 0 and 199999**:
   - `values[value]` is 0 (since all elements from 0 to 199999 are initialized to 0).
   - Therefore, the output will be 0.

### Conclusion:
The output depends on the value of `value`. If `value` is 200000, the output will be `t + digit_sum`. For any other value of `value` between 0 and 199999, the output will be 0.

### Final Output:
Since we do not know the exact value of `value` or `t`, we can only provide a generic answer based on the possible values of `value`.

Output: **0 (if value is between 0 and 199999) or t + digit_sum (if value is 200000, where digit_sum is the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200000)**
