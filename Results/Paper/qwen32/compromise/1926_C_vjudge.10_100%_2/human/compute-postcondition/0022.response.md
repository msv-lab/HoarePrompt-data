The code snippet modifies the value of `values[i]` by setting it to the sum of `values[i - 1]` and `sum_value_digits`. Given the initial state, `values[i - 1]` is `values[200000]`, which is 0 because all elements of `values` are initialized to 0 except `values[1]`. Therefore, `values[i]` (which is `values[200001]`) will be set to `0 + sum_value_digits`, which is `sum_value_digits`.

The other variables (`t`, `inf`, `i`, `sum_value_digits`, and the elements of `values` other than `values[200001]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t` and `values[200001]` which is `sum_value_digits`, `i` is 200001, `sum_value_digits` is `final_sum_value_digits`.**
