The code snippet updates the value of `values[i]` by adding `sum_value_digits` to `values[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `values[i]` is `values[200000]`, `values[i - 1]` is `values[199999]`, and `sum_value_digits` is 2. Since `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t` and `values[200001]` which is `final_sum_value_digits`, `values[199999]` is 0. Therefore, `values[200000]` becomes `0 + 2`, which is 2.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t`, `values[200000]` which is 2, and `values[200001]` which is `final_sum_value_digits`, `i` is 200000, `sum_value_digits` is 2.**
