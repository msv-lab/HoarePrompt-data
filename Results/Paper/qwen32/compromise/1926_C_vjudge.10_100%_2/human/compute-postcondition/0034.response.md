In the provided for loop, the only variable that influences whether the loop will execute is `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The other variables `inf` and `values` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

Let's break it down:

- **`t`**: This is the number of test cases and determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- **`inf`**: This variable is set to 200001 and is not involved in the loop's execution condition. It can remain as is.
- **`values`**: This is a list of 200001 zeros except for `values[200000]`, which is `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `200000`. This list is also not involved in the loop's execution condition. Therefore, it can remain as is.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t`. It must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[200000]` which is `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `200000`**.
