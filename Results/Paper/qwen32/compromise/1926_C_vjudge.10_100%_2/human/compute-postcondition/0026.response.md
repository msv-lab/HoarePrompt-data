The code snippet `sum_value_digits += int(x)` adds the integer value of `x` to `sum_value_digits`. Given the initial state, `sum_value_digits` is initially 0. After the execution of the code, `sum_value_digits` will be equal to the integer value of `x`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still an input integer representing the number of test cases.
- `inf` is still 200001.
- `values` is still a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t` and `values[200001]` which is `final_sum_value_digits`.
- `i` is still 200000.
- `x` is not mentioned in the initial state but its integer value is added to `sum_value_digits`.

Since the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, we can only say that `sum_value_digits` is now equal to `int(x)`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t` and `values[200001]` which is `final_sum_value_digits`, `i` is 200000, `sum_value_digits` is `int(x)`**.
