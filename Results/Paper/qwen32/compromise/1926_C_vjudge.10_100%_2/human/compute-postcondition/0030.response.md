The value of `x` is '0', and when `int(x)` is calculated, it becomes 0. Adding this to `sum_value_digits` (which is 4) results in `sum_value_digits` being updated to 4 + 0, which is still 4. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t` and `values[200001]` which is `final_sum_value_digits`, `i` is 200000, `sum_value_digits` is 4, `x` is '0'**
