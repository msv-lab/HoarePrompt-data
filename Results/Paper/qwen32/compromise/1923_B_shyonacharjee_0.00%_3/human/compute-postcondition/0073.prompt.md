Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input (updated), `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `success` is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input (updated), `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`, `position` is the position from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the health from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input (updated), `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is the previous `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`, `i` is `i` + 1, `position` is the position from the `i`-th tuple of `monsters`, `health` is the health from the `i`-th tuple of `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is `health`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input (updated), `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is the previous `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`, `i` is `i` + 1, `position` is the first element of `monsters[i]`, `health` is the second element of `monsters[i]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
