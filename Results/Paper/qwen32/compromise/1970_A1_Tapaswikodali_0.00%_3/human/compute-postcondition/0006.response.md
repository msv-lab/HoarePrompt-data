The code snippet provided constructs a new string `result` by joining the characters from the list of tuples `details`. Each tuple in `details` contains three elements: `balance`, `-i`, and `char`, where `char` is a character from the string `s`. The code extracts the `char` from each tuple and joins them to form the `result` string.

Since `details` is already sorted by `balance` and then by the negative index, the order of characters in `result` will be the same as the order of characters in the original string `s`. This is because the sorting criteria ensure that the characters are processed in the same sequence they appear in `s`.

Therefore, the `result` string will be identical to the original string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0; `details` is a sorted list of tuples (balance, -i, char) for each character in the string `s`, primarily sorted by balance and secondarily by the negative index; `result` is a string equal to `s`.**
