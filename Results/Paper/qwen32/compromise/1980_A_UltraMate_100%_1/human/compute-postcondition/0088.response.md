To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the logic of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

### Loop Explanation:
The loop runs `t` times. For each iteration:
1. It reads two integers `n` and `m` and a string `s` of length `n`.
2. It initializes `ans` to 0.
3. It creates a string `p` with characters 'ABCDEFG'.
4. It counts the occurrences of each character in `s` using `Counter(s)`, stored in `hmp`.
5. It calculates `ans` by:
   - Adding `m` for each character in `p` that is not in `hmp`.
   - Adding `m - hmp[i]` for each character `i` in `hmp` that has fewer occurrences than `m`.
6. It prints the value of `ans`.

### Given Information:
- The initial state includes `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a`.
- The output state after the first iteration is `18`.
- The output state after the second iteration is described in terms of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `ans`.
- The output state after the third iteration is `ans_initial + sum_diff`.

### Calculation of Final Output State:
The final output state is the cumulative sum of `ans` from each iteration. Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `s` for each iteration after the first, we can infer that the final output state is simply the sum of the `ans` values from all `t` iterations.

Given that the output state after the first iteration is `18`, and assuming the pattern continues similarly for the other iterations (which is implied by the problem statement), the final output state would be the sum of `ans` values from all `t` iterations.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for each iteration, we can assume that the sum of `ans` values for all iterations is simply the sum of the results from each iteration.

### Final Output State:
If we denote the `ans` value from the `i-th` iteration as `ans_i`, the final output state is the sum of all `ans_i` from `i=1` to `i=t`.

Given the first iteration's output is `18` and no further specific details are provided for subsequent iterations, we can infer that the final output state is the sum of all `ans_i` values, which in this context, is simply the sum of the results from each iteration.

Thus, if we assume the pattern of `ans` values remains consistent, the final output state can be described as the cumulative sum of `ans` values from all `t` iterations.

Output State: **Sum of ans values from all t iterations.**

In simpler terms, if the first iteration's `ans` is `18`, and assuming a consistent pattern, the final output state is the sum of all such `ans` values from all `t` iterations. Without specific values for each iteration, the final output state is the cumulative sum of `ans` values from all iterations.

Therefore, the final output state is the sum of `ans` values from all `t` iterations, which is the cumulative sum of the results from each iteration.

Output State: **Sum of ans values from all t iterations.**
