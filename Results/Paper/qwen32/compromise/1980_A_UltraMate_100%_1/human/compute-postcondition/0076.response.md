The for loop in the provided code snippet is:

```python
for i in hmp:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the iterable is `hmp`. Therefore, the state of `hmp` is the only one we can adjust to ensure that the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute, `hmp` must be an iterable (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, etc.) that contains at least one element. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `ans` remain unchanged and do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted such that `hmp` contains at least one element. 

Output State:
State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `ans` remain unchanged, `hmp` must contain at least one element**.
