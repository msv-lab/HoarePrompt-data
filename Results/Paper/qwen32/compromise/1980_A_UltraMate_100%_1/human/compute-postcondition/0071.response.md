Postcondition: **`t` is 18, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is the new string from the input, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object with the character counts of `s`, `i` is `'G'`. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is updated to `ans + m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
