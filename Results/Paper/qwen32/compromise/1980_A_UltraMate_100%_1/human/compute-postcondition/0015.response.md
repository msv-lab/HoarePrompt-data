The code snippet `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. 

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is either `m` or `2*m` depending on whether 'G' is in `hmp`.
- `m` is an integer between 1 and 5.

After the code execution:
- If `ans` was initially `m`, it becomes `m + m` which is `2*m`.
- If `ans` was initially `2*m`, it becomes `2*m + m` which is `3*m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `s` is a string input by the user; `p` is 'ABCDEFG'; `hmp` is a Counter object representing the character counts in `s`; `i` is 'G'. If `i` ('G') was not in `hmp`, `ans` is set to `3*m`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `2*m`.**
