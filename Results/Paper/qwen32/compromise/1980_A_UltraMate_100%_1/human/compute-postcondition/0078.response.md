The code snippet `ans += m - hmp[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `m` and the current value of `hmp[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` (except for the specific element `hmp[i]`) remain unchanged. The condition that `hmp` must contain at least one element and that the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m` is still valid.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged except `ans` which is now `ans + (m - hmp[i])`.**
