The code snippet takes an input string, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state of `t` is 19, and it remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are determined by the input.

Output State: **`t` is 19, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
