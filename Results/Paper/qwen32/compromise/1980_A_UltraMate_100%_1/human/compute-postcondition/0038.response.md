Output State: **`t` is 19, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is the string from the input, `ans` is `m`, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`. The current character `i` is not in `hmp`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `m`, as `ans` was initially 0 and `m` is added to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
