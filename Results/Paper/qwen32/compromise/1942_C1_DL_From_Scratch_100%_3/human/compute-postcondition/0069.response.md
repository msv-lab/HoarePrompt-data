Postcondition: **`T` is 1, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1` and `num` equals 1, `count` is the total number of times `num` was equal to 1 during the iterations plus one, `n` and `y` are the same as read from the input, `list0` is the same as read from the input, `x` is the same as read from the input, `i` is `x - 1`**
