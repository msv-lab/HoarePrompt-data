Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, `count` is the total number of times `num` was equal to 1 during the loop plus two if `num` is 1, otherwise `count` remains the same, `n` and `y` are integers read from the input, `list0` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `x` is greater than 1, and `i` is `x - 2`.**
