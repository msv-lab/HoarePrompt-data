Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and an integer `y` which is always 0. It also receives a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
