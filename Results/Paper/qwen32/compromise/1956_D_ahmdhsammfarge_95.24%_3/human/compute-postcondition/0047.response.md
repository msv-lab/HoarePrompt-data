The code snippet `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the value of `i` to `r` and the value of `j` to `l`. This means that the previous values of `r` and `l` are replaced by the current values of `i` and `j`, respectively. The other variables (`sm`, `lst`, `len(lst)`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the value of `i`, `l` is the value of `j`, `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` is less than `len(lst)`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**.
