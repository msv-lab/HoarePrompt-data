The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `lst`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations, and `r` is the value of `l + 1`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. The value of `r` and `l` are not directly controlled by the loop head and are not part of the loop's iteration logic. Therefore, they remain unchanged in the context of adjusting the loop head variables.

State: **`r` is the value of `l + 1` and `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise:

State: **`r` is the value of `l + 1` and `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations, `i` is `i + 1`**
