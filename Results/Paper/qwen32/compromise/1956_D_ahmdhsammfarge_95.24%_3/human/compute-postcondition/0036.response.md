Postcondition: **`r` is `l + 1` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`; otherwise, `r` remains 0. `l` is `l + 3` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged. `i` is `l + 1` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`; otherwise, `i` remains `l + 1`. `j` is `l + 3` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`; otherwise, `j` remains `i + 2`. `sm` is recalculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)` in both cases. `over_sum` is recalculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)` only if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.**
