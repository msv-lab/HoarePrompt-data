The code snippet `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the value of `i` to `r` and the value of `j` to `l`. 

Given the initial state, we know:
- `r` was initially 0.
- `l` was an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`.
- `i` was `l + 1`.
- `j` was `i + 2`, which simplifies to `l + 3`.

After the assignment:
- `r` takes the value of `i`, which is `l + 1`.
- `l` takes the value of `j`, which is `l + 3`.

The other variables (`sm`, `lst`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is `l + 1`, `l` is `l + 3`, `i` is `l + 1`, `j` is `l + 3`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**
