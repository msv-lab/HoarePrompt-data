Postcondition: **`r` is 0, `l` is an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`, `i` is `l + 1`, `j` is incremented by 1, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is updated to `i`, `l` is updated to `j`, `i` is updated to `l + 1`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. Otherwise, `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` retain their original values.**
