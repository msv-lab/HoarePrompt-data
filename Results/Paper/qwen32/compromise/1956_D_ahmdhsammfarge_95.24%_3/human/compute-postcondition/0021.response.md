To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `j`, and the range it iterates over, which is `range(i + 1, len(lst))`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `r` is 0
- `l` is the index `j` that maximizes `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1)`
- `i` is `l + 1`

The loop starts with `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst))`. For this loop to execute, the range `(i + 1, len(lst))` must be non-empty. This means `i + 1` must be less than `len(lst)`.

Since `i` is defined as `l + 1`, this translates to `l + 2` being less than `len(lst)`. Therefore, `l` must be such that there are at least two elements in `lst` after `l`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `l` must be an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`.
- `i` is `l + 1`, so this will automatically be adjusted based on `l`.
- `r` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`r` is 0, `l` must be an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`, `i` is `l + 1`**
