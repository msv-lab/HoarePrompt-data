The code assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `over_sum` will now be equal to `sm`, which is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`.

Output State: **`r` is the value of `i`, `l` is the value of `j`, `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` is less than `len(lst)`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**.
