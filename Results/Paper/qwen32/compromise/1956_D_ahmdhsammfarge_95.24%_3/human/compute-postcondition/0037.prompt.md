Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is 0, `l` is the index `j` that maximizes `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1)`, `i` is `l + 1`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
    if sm > over_sum:
        r, l = [i, j]
        over_sum = sm


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `r` is 0, `l` is an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`, `i` is `l + 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, and if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is updated to `i` and `l` is updated to `j` with `i` recalculated as `l + 1` and `sm` recalculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. Otherwise, `r`, `l`, `i`, and `sm` retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is 0, `l` is an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`, `i` is `l + 1`, `j` is incremented by 1, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is updated to `i`, `l` is updated to `j`, `i` is updated to `l + 1`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. Otherwise, `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is `l + 1` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`; otherwise, `r` remains 0. `l` is `l + 3` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged. `i` is `l + 1` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`; otherwise, `i` remains `l + 1`. `j` is `l + 3` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`; otherwise, `j` remains `i + 2`. `sm` is recalculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)` in both cases. `over_sum` is recalculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)` only if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
