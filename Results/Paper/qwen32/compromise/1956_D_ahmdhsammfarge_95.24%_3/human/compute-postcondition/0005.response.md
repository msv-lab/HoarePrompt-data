To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_2(r, l, ops)` and how it modifies the `ops` list based on the conditions provided. Since the function `func_2` itself is not defined in the given context, we will assume that the function operates as described in the problem statement. 

Given the initial state:
- `r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst).
- `lst` is a list of integers.
- `ops` is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers, with the additional element `[r + 1, r + 1]` appended to it.
- If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the list `ops` will have the element `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended to it. Otherwise, `ops` remains unchanged, except that `[r + 1, r + 1]` has been appended to it.

After the function `func_2(r, l, ops)` is called, the `ops` list will have `[r + 1, r + 1]` appended to it. Additionally, if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, `[r + 1, l + 1]` will also be appended to `ops`.

Let's break down the output state:
- `r` and `l` remain unchanged.
- `lst` remains unchanged.
- `ops` will have `[r + 1, r + 1]` appended to it.
- If the minimum value in `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, `[r + 1, l + 1]` will also be appended to `ops`.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst); `lst` is a list of integers; `ops` is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers, with the additional element `[r + 1, r + 1]` appended to it, and if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, `[r + 1, l + 1]` is also appended to `ops`.**
