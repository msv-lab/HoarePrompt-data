Postcondition: **`r` is the value of `l + 1`, `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations. If `sm > over_sum`, then `r` is updated to `i` and `l` is updated to `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `j` is `j + 1` and `j` is less than `len(lst)`, and `sm` remains `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. If `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`, `r` and `l` retain their original values, and `over_sum` remains unchanged.**
