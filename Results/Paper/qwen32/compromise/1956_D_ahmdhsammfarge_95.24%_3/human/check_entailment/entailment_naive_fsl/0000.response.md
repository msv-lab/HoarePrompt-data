Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array as described in the problem statement. The code seems to be incomplete and does not properly handle the operations to maximize the sum.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to find the best segment `[l, r]` to replace with the MEX value to maximize the sum. However, it calculates the sum incorrectly and does not compute the MEX value for the segment. Instead, it calculates a sum based on the length of the segment squared, which is not the correct approach.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function seems to be intended to perform recursive operations, but it does not correctly implement the logic to replace the segment with the MEX value. It only appends operations without actually modifying the array.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is supposed to perform the replacement operation and update the array. However, it does not correctly compute the MEX value for the segment `[r, l]`. It simply fills the segment with the length of the segment, which is not the MEX value.

4. **Overall Logic**: The code does not correctly implement the MEX operation, which is crucial for maximizing the sum of the array. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set. The code does not compute this value correctly, and thus, it does not perform the operations to maximize the sum.

Here is a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
3
1 3 9
```

**Expected Output:**
```
13 0
```

**Actual Output:**
The provided code does not produce the correct output because it does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not perform the operations to maximize the sum.

Therefore, the code is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
