To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. The goal of the program is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a series of operations, each of which replaces a subarray with its MEX (minimum excluded value). The program is supposed to output the maximum sum and a sequence of operations achieving this sum.

Let's break down the provided code and see if it correctly implements the solution:

### Function 1: `func_1`
This function is supposed to find the optimal subarray `[i:j]` to replace with its MEX. It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the new sum if that subarray is replaced by its MEX value. It keeps track of the maximum sum found and the corresponding subarray indices.

However, the way it calculates the new sum is incorrect. The formula `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` does not correctly represent the new sum after replacing the subarray with its MEX. The new sum should be calculated by adding the MEX value multiplied by the length of the subarray, not the square of the length.

### Function 2: `func_2`
This function is recursive and seems to be intended to generate a sequence of operations to replace a subarray `[r:l]` with its MEX value. However, the logic is not clear and does not seem to correctly generate the required operations.

### Function 3: `func_3`
This function is supposed to perform the replacement of the subarray `[r:l]` with its MEX value, update the list, and generate the corresponding operations. However, the logic here is also flawed. It appends operations without ensuring that the MEX value is correctly calculated or applied.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for calculating the new sum, generating operations, and replacing subarrays with their MEX values is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
