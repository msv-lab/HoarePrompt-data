Let's analyze the provided Python program and its functions to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing a series of operations where you can choose a subarray and set all its elements to the MEX of the subarray. The MEX (minimum excluded value) is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

### Functions and Their Roles:
1. **`func_1(lst)`**: This function is supposed to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)^2` for all possible subarrays defined by indices `i` and `j`. This sum expression does not directly relate to the MEX operation or maximizing the array sum. Instead, it seems to be trying to find a subarray that, if replaced, could potentially increase the sum the most, but this approach is not aligned with the MEX operation.

2. **`func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**: This function recursively appends operations to `ops`. However, the logic of this function does not align with the problem's requirements. It does not perform any operation that would maximize the array sum based on the MEX.

3. **`func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**: This function modifies the list `lst` by setting all elements in the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) to the length `n` of that sublist (`n = l - r + 1`). It also appends specific operations to the list `ops`. This function does perform an operation that could potentially increase the sum by replacing a subarray with its MEX, but the logic is not correctly derived from the MEX operation.

### Program Logic:
- The program starts by reading the input and initializing an empty list `ops` for operations.
- It then enters a loop that uses `func_1` to find indices `r` and `l` and uses `func_3` to modify the list `lst` and append operations to `ops` until `r` equals `l`.
- After the loop, it tries to find zeros in the list and replace them with 1, appending the corresponding operations.
- Finally, it prints the sum of the modified list and the number of operations.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Maximization Approach**: The program does not correctly use the MEX operation to maximize the sum. Instead, it uses an unrelated sum expression to determine which subarray to modify.
- **Incorrect Operations**: The operations appended to `ops` do not necessarily reflect the correct MEX operations needed to maximize the sum.
- **Inefficient and Incorrect Logic**: The logic in `func_2` and `func_3` does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It uses incorrect logic to determine which subarray to modify and does not properly use the MEX operation to maximize the sum of the array.

**Correctness: False**
