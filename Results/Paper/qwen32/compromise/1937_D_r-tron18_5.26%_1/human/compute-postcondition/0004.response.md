Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that `len(s1) = n`, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where the character '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list generated by accumulating `pre` with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with a single element `0`, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `0`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is initialized to a list of length `n` with all elements set to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
