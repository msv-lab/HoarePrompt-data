Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the way it handles the input and the function call. The program reads the input into the variable `n` and then immediately calls `func_1(n)`. However, `func_1` is defined after this call, which will result in a `NameError` because `func_1` is not recognized at the time of the call.

To fix this, the function `func_1` should be defined before it is called. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i - 1]  # Corrected index to i - 1
    return ans

n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

Additionally, there is another issue in the line `ans += s[i]`. The dictionary `d` contains positions starting from 1, but the string `s` is indexed from 0. Therefore, `s[i - 1]` should be used to correctly access the character at the corresponding position.

After making these corrections, the program should work as expected for the problem description provided. However, since the original program does not follow the correct order and has an off-by-one error, it is considered incorrect.
