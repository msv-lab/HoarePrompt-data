The code snippet `d.pop(n)` removes the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Since `d` initially contains keys from 1 to `n`, after this operation, the key `n` will no longer be present in `d`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive, and the values represent the cumulative balance of parentheses up to that position, starting from 0.**
