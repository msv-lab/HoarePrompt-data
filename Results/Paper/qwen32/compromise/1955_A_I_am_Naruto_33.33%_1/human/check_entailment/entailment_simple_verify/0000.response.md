### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated version to ensure it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- **Pricing**:
  - One yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts cost `b` burles (promotion price).
- **Input**:
  - Number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Output**:
  - For each test case, print the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts using the provided prices `a` and `b`.

Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
```

#### Evaluation:
1. **Handling `n > 1`**:
   - `ans1` calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `a * n`.
   - `ans2` calculates the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs where possible:
     - `b * (n // 2)` accounts for the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs.
     - `a * (n % 2)` accounts for the cost of the remaining yogurt if `n` is odd.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

2. **Handling `n == 1`**:
   - If `n` is 1, the only option is to buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
   - The program correctly handles this case with `print(a)`.

#### Testing:
Let's test the program with the provided example inputs:
```
4
2 5 9
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
```
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9`
  - Minimum cost: `9`
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 18 + 5 = 23`
  - Minimum cost: `15`
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 22 + 5 = 27`
  - Minimum cost: `15`
- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 22`
  - Minimum cost: `20`

The program produces the expected outputs for the given examples.

#### Edge Cases:
- **When `n = 1`**: The program correctly prints `a` as the cost.
- **When `n` is even**: The program correctly calculates the cost using the promotion price for all pairs.
- **When `n` is odd**: The program correctly calculates the cost using the promotion price for all pairs and adds the cost of the remaining yogurt.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all possible cases as per the problem statement. It calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by considering both individual and promotional prices. There are no apparent edge cases that the program fails to handle.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the program is correct.
