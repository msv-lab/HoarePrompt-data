Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap

- **Objective:** Determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- **Options:**
  - Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
  - Buy two yogurts for `b` burles.
- **Constraints:** `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30`.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts using the following logic:

1. **If `n > 1`:**
   - `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `a * n`.
   - `ans2` is the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs whenever possible, and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought individually:
     - `b * (n // 2)` calculates the cost for buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts.
     - `a * (n % 2)` calculates the cost for the remaining yogurt, if `n` is odd.
   - The program prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

2. **If `n == 1`:**
   - The program simply prints `a` because there's only one yogurt to buy.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9`
   - Minimum cost: `min(10, 9) = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 9 + 5 = 14`
   - Minimum cost: `min(15, 14) = 14`
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 11 + 5 = 16`
   - Minimum cost: `min(15, 16) = 15`
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - Minimum cost: `min(20, 22) = 20`
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion

Upon re-evaluating the program with the provided test cases, we see that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each scenario. The original assessment is accurate, and there are no discrepancies or errors in the program's logic.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
