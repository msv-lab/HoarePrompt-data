You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State: After processing all t test cases, the program will have printed the minimum cost for each test case based on the given formulae. The variables t, n, a, b, ans1, and ans2 will no longer hold their initial values as they are updated in each iteration of the loop. The state of other variables not mentioned in the loop remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the given criteria. The cost is determined by either `a * n` or `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, whichever is smaller, unless `n` is 1, in which case the cost is simply `a`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated minimum cost for each one.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program with respect to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- **Pricing**:
  - One yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts cost `b` burles (promotion price).
- **Input**:
  - Number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Output**:
  - For each test case, print the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts using the provided prices `a` and `b`.

Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
```

### Evaluation:
1. **Handling `n > 1`**:
   - `ans1` calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `a * n`.
   - `ans2` calculates the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs where possible:
     - `b * (n // 2)` accounts for the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs.
     - `a * (n % 2)` accounts for the cost of the remaining yogurt if `n` is odd.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

2. **Handling `n == 1`**:
   - If `n` is 1, the only option is to buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
   - The program correctly handles this case with `print(a)`.

### Testing:
Let's test the program with the provided example inputs:
```
4
2 5 9
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
```
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9`
  - Minimum cost: `9`
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 18 + 5 = 23`
  - Minimum cost: `15`
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 22 + 5 = 27`
  - Minimum cost: `15`
- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 22`
  - Minimum cost: `20`

The program produces the expected outputs for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all possible cases as per the problem statement. It calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by considering both individual and promotional prices. There are no apparent edge cases that the program fails to handle.

**Correctness: True**.
