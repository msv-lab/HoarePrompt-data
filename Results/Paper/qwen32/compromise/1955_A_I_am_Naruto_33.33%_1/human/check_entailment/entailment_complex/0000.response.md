### Reasoning:

The function `func()` is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case consists of three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts on promotion). The goal is to determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

Let's break down how the function operates:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n > 1`, the function calculates two potential costs:
     - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought individually, which is `a * n`.
     - `ans2`: The cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible, which is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`. This formula accounts for the number of complete pairs (`n // 2`) and any leftover yogurt (`n % 2`).
   - The function then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If `n == 1`, the function directly prints the cost of one yogurt, which is `a`.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The function correctly handles the base case where `n == 1` by simply printing the price `a`.
   - For `n > 1`, the function considers both the individual purchase cost and the promotion cost, ensuring that the minimum cost is chosen. The promotion cost is calculated by buying as many pairs as possible and adding the cost of any remaining yogurt individually.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the function with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9`
   - Minimum cost: `9`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 18 + 5 = 23`
   - Minimum cost: `15`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 16 + 5 = 21`
   - Minimum cost: `15`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 22`
   - Minimum cost: `20`

The function's outputs match the expected results for all test cases, confirming its correctness.

### Conclusion:

The function correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given criteria.

**Correctness: True**
