The code snippet `max_diff = diff` updates the value of `max_diff` to the current value of `diff`. This means that the previous value of `max_diff` is replaced by `diff`. Since `next_max_diff` was previously set to the value of `max_diff`, it now holds the old value of `max_diff` before the update. The variable `index` remains `i`, which is 3. The values of `n` and `diff` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` is `diff`, `next_max_diff` is the previous value of `max_diff`, `index` is 3, `i` is 3.**

In simpler terms, `max_diff` is now equal to `diff`, `next_max_diff` holds the old value of `max_diff`, and all other variables retain their initial values.
