Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`; `ans` is `max_diff`; `D` has at least two elements; `l` is the insertion point in `D` for `left - f`; `h` is `mid`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; and `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum`.**

In this output state, the variable `h` has been updated to the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
