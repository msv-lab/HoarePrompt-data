Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`; `f` is the next value in `F`; `l` is the smallest index in `D` such that `D[l] > left - f`; `h` is the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `l < h`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Natural Language: The variable `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `l` and half the difference between `h` and `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
