The code assigns the values of `A[index - 1]` and `A[index]` to the variables `left` and `right`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`.**

In natural language: The variables `left` and `right` are now assigned the values of the elements in `A` at positions `index - 1` and `index`, respectively. All other variables retain their initial values.
