Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1; `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to the value of `diff` and `next_max_diff` is set to the previous value of `max_diff`; `index` is `i`. Otherwise, if `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff` and greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to the value of `diff`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.**
