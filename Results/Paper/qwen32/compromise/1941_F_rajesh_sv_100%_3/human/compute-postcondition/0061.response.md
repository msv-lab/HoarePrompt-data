Postcondition: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`; if `l` and `h` are equal, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`. `l` and `h` are equal and represent the final index from the binary search; `mid` is the last calculated middle index; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
