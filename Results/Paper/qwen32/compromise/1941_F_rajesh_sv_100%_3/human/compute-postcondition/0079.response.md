The only variable in the loop head is `l` and `h`, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `l < h`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` must be less than `h` for the loop to execute again. Since the loop body updates `l` to `mid + 1` or `h` to `mid`, we need to ensure that after these updates, `l` is still less than `h`.

Given that `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, we need to ensure that after the update, `l` is still strictly less than `h`. The simplest way to guarantee this is to ensure that `l` and `h` are such that there is at least one more midpoint to check.

So, we can adjust the state to ensure that `h` is at least `l + 1` after the last iteration.

State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`. `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are recalculated as `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively. `f` is the next value in `F`. `l` must be less than `h` and `h` must be at least `l + 1`. `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
