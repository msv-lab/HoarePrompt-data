Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`. `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are recalculated as `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively. `f` is the next value in `F`. `l` must be less than `h`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `left`, `right`, `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum`.
