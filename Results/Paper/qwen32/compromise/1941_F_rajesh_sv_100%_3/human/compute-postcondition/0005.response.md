The only variable in the loop head is `testcases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of this iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must be greater than 0 before the decrement.

State: **`testcases` is greater than 1**
