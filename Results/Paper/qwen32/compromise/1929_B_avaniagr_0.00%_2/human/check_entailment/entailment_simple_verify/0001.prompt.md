You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) — the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:

        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: The output state consists of t lines, each representing the result of the computation for the corresponding test case. Each line contains an integer value determined by the given formula based on the values of n and k from the input. Specifically, for each test case, the output is calculated as follows:
    #- If k is less than 4n - 3, the output is (k // 2 + k % 2).
    #- If k is equal to 4n - 2, the output is 1 added to the previous result.
    #- If k is equal to or greater than 4n - 3, the output is 2 * n.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem statement. The problem requires us to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Diagonals**:
   - In an \( n \times n \) grid, there are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals that run from the top-left to the bottom-right (let's call these "main diagonals").
   - There are also \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals that run from the top-right to the bottom-left (let's call these "anti-diagonals").
   - Therefore, the total number of diagonals is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Minimum Number of Colored Cells**:
   - If \( k \leq 2n - 1 \), we can color cells in the main diagonals and anti-diagonals to cover \( k \) diagonals with the minimum number of cells. Specifically, we need to color \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\) cells.
   - If \( k > 2n - 1 \) but \( k < 4n - 3 \), we need to color cells in both main and anti-diagonals. We can cover \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals with \( n \) cells (one cell per main diagonal or anti-diagonal), and then we need to cover the remaining \( k - (2n - 1) \) diagonals. The remaining diagonals can be covered by coloring additional cells, but the formula provided in the code seems to handle this case incorrectly.
   - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), we need to color all diagonals, which means we need \( 2n - 1 \) cells in main diagonals and \( n - 1 \) additional cells in anti-diagonals, totaling \( 2n - 1 + n - 1 = 3n - 2 \) cells, but the code suggests \( 2n \) cells plus one extra, which seems incorrect.

Let's analyze the given code:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```
- The expression `(k // 2 + k % 2)` calculates \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\), which is correct for \( k \leq 2n - 1 \).
- The expression `2 * n` is used when \( k \geq 4n - 3 \). This seems incorrect because it does not consider the exact number of diagonals needed and the distribution of cells.
- The expression `(k == 4 * n - 2)` adds 1 if \( k = 4n - 2 \), which is also incorrect as explained above.

Given the above analysis, the code does not correctly handle all cases, especially when \( k \) is close to \( 4n - 2 \).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
