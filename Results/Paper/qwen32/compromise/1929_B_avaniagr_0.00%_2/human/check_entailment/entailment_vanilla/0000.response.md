To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem statement. The problem requires us to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Diagonals**:
   - In an \( n \times n \) grid, there are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals that run from the top-left to the bottom-right (let's call these "main diagonals").
   - There are also \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals that run from the top-right to the bottom-left (let's call these "anti-diagonals").
   - Therefore, the total number of diagonals is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Minimum Number of Colored Cells**:
   - If \( k \leq 2n - 1 \), we can color cells in the main diagonals and anti-diagonals to cover \( k \) diagonals with the minimum number of cells. Specifically, we need to color \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\) cells.
   - If \( k > 2n - 1 \) but \( k < 4n - 3 \), we need to color cells in both main and anti-diagonals. We can cover \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals with \( n \) cells (one cell per main diagonal or anti-diagonal), and then we need to cover the remaining \( k - (2n - 1) \) diagonals. The remaining diagonals can be covered by coloring additional cells, but the formula provided in the code seems to handle this case incorrectly.
   - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), we need to color all diagonals, which means we need \( 2n - 1 \) cells in main diagonals and \( n - 1 \) additional cells in anti-diagonals, totaling \( 2n - 1 + n - 1 = 3n - 2 \) cells, but the code suggests \( 2n \) cells plus one extra, which seems incorrect.

Let's analyze the given code:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```
- The expression `(k // 2 + k % 2)` calculates \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\), which is correct for \( k \leq 2n - 1 \).
- The expression `2 * n` is used when \( k \geq 4n - 3 \). This seems incorrect because it does not consider the exact number of diagonals needed and the distribution of cells.
- The expression `(k == 4 * n - 2)` adds 1 if \( k = 4n - 2 \), which is also incorrect as explained above.

Given the above analysis, the code does not correctly handle all cases, especially when \( k \) is close to \( 4n - 2 \).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
