You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) — the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: The output state consists of t lines, each representing the result of the computation for the corresponding test case. Each line contains an integer value determined by the given formula based on the values of n and k from the input. Specifically, for each test case, the output is calculated as follows:
    #- If k is less than 4n - 3, the output is (k // 2 + k % 2).
    #- If k is equal to 4n - 2, the output is 1 added to the previous result.
    #- If k is equal to or greater than 4n - 3, the output is 2 * n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. It calculates and outputs an integer value for each test case based on the given conditions: if `k` is less than `4n - 3`, it outputs `(k // 2 + k % 2)`, if `k` is equal to `4n - 2`, it outputs `1` more than the previous result, and if `k` is equal to or greater than `4n - 3`, it outputs `2 * n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine if the program meets all the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine the minimum number of cells to color in an `n x n` grid such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has `4n - 2` diagonals in total.

### Program Analysis
Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```

### Logical Breakdown
The program seems to be using a formula to determine the minimum number of cells to color based on the values of `n` and `k`. Let's break down the formula:
- `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`: This part of the formula suggests that if `k` is less than `4n - 3`, it calculates the minimum number of cells to color by taking the ceiling of `k/2` and multiplying it by a boolean condition `(k < 4 * n - 3)`.
- `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This part suggests that if `k` is greater than or equal to `4n - 3`, it calculates the minimum number of cells to color as `2n`.
- `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This part adds `1` if `k` is exactly `4n - 2`.

### Testing the Program
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some edge cases to see if it behaves as expected.

### Example Test Cases

   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2`
   
3. **Input:** `3 10`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Program Output: `6`
   
4. **Input:** `3 9`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Program Output: `5`
   
5. **Input:** `4 7`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Program Output: `4`
   
6. **Input:** `7 11`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Program Output: `6`
   
7. **Input:** `2 3`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2`

### Edge Cases
Let's consider some edge cases:
1. **Input:** `2 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1` (since `k < 4n - 3` and `(k // 2 + k % 2)` evaluates to `1`)

2. **Input:** `2 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1` (since `k < 4n - 3` and `(k // 2 + k % 2)` evaluates to `1`)

3. **Input:** `2 3`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2` (since `k < 4n - 3` and `(k // 2 + k % 2)` evaluates to `2`)

4. **Input:** `2 4`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2` (since `k < 4n - 3` and `(k // 2 + k % 2)` evaluates to `2`)

5. **Input:** `2 5`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Program Output: `4` (since `k >= 4n - 3` and `2 * n` evaluates to `4`)

### Conclusion
After testing the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases, it appears to correctly compute the minimum number of cells to color for the given `n` and `k` values. The logic in the program seems to cover the necessary conditions and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.
