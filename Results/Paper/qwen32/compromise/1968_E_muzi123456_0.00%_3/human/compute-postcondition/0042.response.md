Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This suggests that `t` has been decremented by 1, but the initial value of `t` is not specified.
- `n` is the input integer: This means `n` is a given integer value.
- `i` is `n + 1`: This means `i` is the value of `n` incremented by 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(' ')
```

The `print` statement in the code snippet is printing a single space character.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output. The `print` statement is simply outputting a space.

Output: ** ** (a single space character)**
