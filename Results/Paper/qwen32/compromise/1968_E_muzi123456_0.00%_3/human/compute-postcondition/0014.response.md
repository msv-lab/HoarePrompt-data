In the given task, the initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `i`. Specifically:

- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000.
- `i` is defined as `n + 1`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(' ')
```

This statement is printing a single space character. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` do not affect the output of this particular `print` statement because it is explicitly printing a space character and does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply a space character.

Output: ** ** (a single space)**
