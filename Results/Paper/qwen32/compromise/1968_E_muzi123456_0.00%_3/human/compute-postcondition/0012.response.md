The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000.
- `i` is explicitly set to 5.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

To determine the output, we need to evaluate the value of `i` based on the given initial state. According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 5.

Thus, the `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 5.

Output: **5**
