To determine the state that allows the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head. The loop condition is `while t:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is a non-zero value.

Given the state right before the loop: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, this already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once because `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, no adjustment to the state is necessary since the loop condition is already satisfied with the given state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3**
