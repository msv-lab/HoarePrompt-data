The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer value of the user input. Given that the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, the value of `t` will be updated to whatever integer the user inputs, which must still fall within this range.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.**
