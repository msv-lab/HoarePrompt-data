To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the given initial and intermediate states.

The loop is structured as follows:
```python
while t:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print('1', end=' ')
        print(i)
    print(' ')
```

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000.

### Loop Execution:
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` becomes `t - 1`.
   - `n` is read as input.
   - A nested loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`, printing `1 i` on each line.
   - After the nested loop, a blank line is printed.

2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - This process repeats `t - 1` more times, each time decrementing `t` by 1 and processing a new input value for `n`.

### Final State:
- The loop continues until `t` becomes 0.
- At this point, the loop terminates.

### Output State:
- `t` will be 0 since the loop runs until `t` is decremented to 0.
- `n` will be the last input value read in the final iteration of the loop.
- `i` will be `n + 1` after the last iteration of the nested loop.

### Human-readable Description:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last input integer processed, and `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n` and `i` is incremented to `n + 1` after the loop completes.

Output State: **t is 0, n is the last input integer, i is n + 1.**
