Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < n, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is a list with at least one element, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, `prime_to_i` is 1, `factors` is a dictionary containing the key `prime` with a non-negative integer value, and `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded `factors[prime] + 1` times. `factor` is the next element in the list `rest`.**

Explanation: The value of `prime_to_i` has been reset to 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
