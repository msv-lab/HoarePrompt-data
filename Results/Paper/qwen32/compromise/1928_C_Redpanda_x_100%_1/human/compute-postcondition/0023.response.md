Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < n, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is a list with at least one element, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, `prime_to_i` is `prime`, `factors` is a dictionary containing the key `prime` with a value of `factors[prime] + 1`, `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded `factors[prime] + 1` times, `factor` is the next element in the list `rest`, and `factor * prime_to_i` has been returned.**

The value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded `factors[prime] + 1` times, and it has been returned. The values of `k`, `n`, `x`, `primes`, `rest`, `prime`, `prime_to_i`, and `factors` remain unchanged.
