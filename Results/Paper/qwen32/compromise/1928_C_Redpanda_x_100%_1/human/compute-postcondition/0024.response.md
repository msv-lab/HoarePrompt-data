Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < n, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is a list with at least one element, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`, `factors` is a dictionary containing the key `prime` with a value of `factors[prime] + 1`, `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded `factors[prime] + 1` times, `factor` is the next element in the list `rest`, and `factor * prime_to_i` has been returned.**

In natural language: The value of `prime_to_i` has been updated to be the square of `prime` (i.e., `prime * prime`). All other variables retain their previous values and states.
