You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
Given a position `n` in a line and a number `x` that Vasya received, we need to find how many different values of `k` fit the given constraints for the described "settling" pattern.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The code provided consists of two functions: `func_1` and `generate`. However, there are some issues and missing parts in the code that need to be addressed:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to find the prime factors of a number `n` and generate all possible factors of `n` using the `generate` function.
   - The `primes` variable is referenced in the `generate` function, but it is not defined in the scope of `generate`. It should be passed as an argument.

2. **Function `generate`**:
   - This function is a recursive generator that should yield all factors of a number based on its prime factorization.
   - However, it references the `factors` dictionary and `primes` list, which are not defined within its scope. They should be passed as arguments.

3. **Logic for Solving the Problem**:
   - The problem requires finding all possible `k` values such that the position `n` in the sequence corresponds to the number `x` according to the described pattern.
   - The sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and within each segment of `2k - 2`, the first `k` positions are `1, 2, ..., k`, and the next `k - 2` positions are `k - 1, k - 2, ..., 2`.
   - To determine if a given `k` is valid, we need to check if the position `n` modulo `2k - 2` corresponds to the number `x` in the sequence.

### Correctness of the Provided Code:
The provided code does not directly solve the problem as it is incomplete and has scope issues. The logic for determining the valid `k` values is not implemented in the provided code.

### Correct Implementation:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over possible values of `k`.
2. For each `k`, determine the position in the sequence for the given `n` and check if it matches `x`.
3. Count the number of valid `k` values.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
def count_valid_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length
        if position_in_cycle < k - 1:
            if position_in_cycle + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if 2 * k - 2 - position_in_cycle == x:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        x = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_k(n, x))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it is incomplete and does not implement the required logic.

Correctness: **False**
