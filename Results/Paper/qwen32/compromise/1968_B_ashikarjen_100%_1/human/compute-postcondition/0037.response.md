The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input such that `b[1]` is not equal to `a[1]`; `i` is 1; `j` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input such that `b[1]` is not equal to `a[1]`; `i` is 1; `j` is 2.**
