To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `b[j]` and `a[i]`.

The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`. For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the `and` statement must be true. Let's analyze each part:

1. **`j < m`**: This condition must be true. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. Since `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, the condition `j < m` will be true if `m` is greater than 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 2 for this condition to be true.

2. **`b[j] != a[i]`**: This condition must also be true. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is 0. So we need to ensure that `b[1]` is not equal to `a[0]`.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust `m` to be at least 2 and ensure that `b[1]` is not equal to `a[0]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5 and `m` must be at least 2; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length m read from the input and `b[1]` must not be equal to `a[0]`; `k` is 1 if `j` was less than `m` and has been incremented by 1, otherwise `k` is 0; `j` is 1; `i` is 0**
