The value of `j` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `j` was the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[0]` and `j < m`, after incrementing `j`, it is now `j + 1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `i`) retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length m read from the input; `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[0]` and `j < m`, incremented by 1; `k` is 2; `i` is 0.**
