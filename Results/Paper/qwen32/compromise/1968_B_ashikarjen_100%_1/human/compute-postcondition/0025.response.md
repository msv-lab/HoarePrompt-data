Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5 and `m` must be greater than 2; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input, `b[1]` must not be equal to `a[0]`, and `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[0]`; `k` is 1 if `j` was less than `m` and has been incremented by 1, otherwise `k` is 0; `j` is 3; `i` is 0`**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
