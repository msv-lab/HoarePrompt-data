You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Output

    2

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5. a and b are binary strings of lengths n and m, respectively. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all m values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input; `k` is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in the specified order; `j` is the position in `b` after the last match or the position where the search stopped if a match was not found.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in the specified order)
    return
    #The program does not return any value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It counts the maximum number of characters from string `a` that can be found in string `b` in the specified order and prints this count. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The task is to find the maximum length k of the prefix of string `a` that can be found as a subsequence in string `b`. A subsequence allows skipping characters in `b` to match the characters in `a` in order. The provided program follows a correct approach to solve this problem:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the lengths of the two strings `a` and `b`, followed by the strings themselves.
3. It initializes two pointers: `k` to count the length of the matching prefix and `j` to traverse through `b`.
4. It iterates over each character in `a` using a for loop.
5. For each character in `a`, it uses a while loop to find the next occurrence of that character in `b` starting from the current position of `j`.
6. If the character in `a` is found in `b` (i.e., `j < m`), it increments `k` and moves `j` to the next position.
7. If the character in `a` is not found in `b` (i.e., `j >= m`), it breaks out of the loop as no further characters in `a` can be matched as a subsequence.
8. Finally, it prints the value of `k` which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

The logic is correct and efficiently handles the constraints provided (up to 10^4 test cases with string lengths up to 2*10^5).
