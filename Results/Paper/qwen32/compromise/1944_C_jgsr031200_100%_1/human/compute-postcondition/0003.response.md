The code snippet initializes a variable `cou` to 0. This does not affect the `freq` list or any other variables that were previously defined. The `freq` list retains its initial state as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`freq` is a list where each index `j` from 0 to `n` contains the count of how many times `j` appears in the list `arr`; `cou` is 0.**
