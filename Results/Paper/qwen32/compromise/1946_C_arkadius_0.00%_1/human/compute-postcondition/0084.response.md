Output State: **`postorder` is not empty, `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one more element that has not been processed, `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` that has not been processed yet, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.**

In simpler terms, after the code execution, the `good_components` attribute of the vertex `v` in the tree is updated to include the `good_components` of its child `u`. All other conditions and states remain the same.
