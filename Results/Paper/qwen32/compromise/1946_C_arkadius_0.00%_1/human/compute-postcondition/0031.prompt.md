Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute. `postorder` is `True`, `stack` remains `[]`, and `v` is `s`. `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, and `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute where `tree.vertices[v]` has at least one child, `postorder` is `True`, `stack` remains `[]`, and `v` is `s`. `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, and `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[s].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[s].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[s].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[s].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute where `tree.vertices[v]` has at least one child, `postorder` is `True`, `stack` remains `[]`, and `v` is `s`. `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, and `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component. `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[s].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute where `tree.vertices[v]` has at least one child; `postorder` is `True`; `stack` remains `[]`; `v` is `s`; `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex; `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component; `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[s].children` after the current `u`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[s].good_components` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[s].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[s].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[s].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[s].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
