The code `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge to the `tree` object between the nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`. This operation modifies the `tree` object but does not change the values of `n`, `u`, `v`, or `i`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `u`, `v`, and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5; `u` and `v` are integers read from the input; `i` is 5; an edge is added to `tree` between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`.**
