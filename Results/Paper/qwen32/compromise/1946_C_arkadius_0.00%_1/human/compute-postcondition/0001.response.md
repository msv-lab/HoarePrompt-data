The code snippet creates an instance of a `Tree` object with `n` as its parameter. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers from the input, with `1 <= k < n`. The execution of the code does not change the values of `n` and `k`; it only introduces a new variable `tree` which is an instance of `Tree` initialized with `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input such that 1 <= k < n, `tree` is an instance of `Tree` initialized with `n`.**
