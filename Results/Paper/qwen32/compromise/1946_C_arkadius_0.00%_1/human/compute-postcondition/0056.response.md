Postcondition: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + 1` if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise it is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` regardless of the condition on `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` retains its value if it was less than `x`. `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**
