Postcondition: **`u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**
