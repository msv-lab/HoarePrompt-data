The code appends a tuple `(v, True)` to the `stack`. Given that `v` is `u1`, the new element added to the `stack` is `(u1, True)`. This change affects the `stack` variable, while the other variables (`tree`, `v`, and `postorder`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute; `stack` is `[(s, True), (u1, True)]`; `v` is `u1`; `postorder` is `False`.**
