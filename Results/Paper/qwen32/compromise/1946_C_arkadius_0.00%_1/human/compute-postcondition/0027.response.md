Output State: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute where `tree.vertices[v]` has at least one child; `postorder` is `True`; `stack` remains `[]`; `v` is `s`; `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex; `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component; `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[s].children` after the current `u`; `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`.**

In simple terms, the `good_components` attribute of the vertex `v` (which is `s`) is now the sum of its previous `good_components` and the `good_components` of its child `u`. All other variables remain unchanged.
