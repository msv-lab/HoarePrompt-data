Postcondition: **`v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` if `postorder` was initially empty. `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append if `postorder` was initially empty. `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children` if `postorder` was initially empty. The second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)` if `postorder` was initially empty. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have been fully processed if `postorder` was initially empty. If `postorder` is not empty, no changes are made to `stack` and the postcondition retains the initial state of `v` and `postorder`. If `postorder` was initially empty, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of the good components of all children of `v` plus 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of the `remaining_size` of all children of `v` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both the case where `postorder` is empty and where it is not.
