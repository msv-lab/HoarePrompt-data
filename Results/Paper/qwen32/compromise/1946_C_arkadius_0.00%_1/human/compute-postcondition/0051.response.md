Postcondition: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1` if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`. Other parts of the state remain unchanged.**
