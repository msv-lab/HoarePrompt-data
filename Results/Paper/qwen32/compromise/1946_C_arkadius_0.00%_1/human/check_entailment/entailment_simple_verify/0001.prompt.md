You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges from a tree results in each connected component having at least `x` vertices.

### Program Explanation

#### Data Structure
The program uses a `Tree` data structure which is not defined in the provided code snippet. We can infer that this `Tree` class should have methods to handle vertices and edges, and it should be capable of representing a tree structure.

#### Functions
1. **func_1**: This function performs a post-order traversal of the tree starting from vertex `s`. It calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at `s`. A good component is defined as a subtree whose size is at least `x`.
2. **func_2**: This function is similar to `func_1` and also performs a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at `v`.
3. **func_3**: This function checks if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. It uses the results from `func_1`.
4. **func_4**: This function uses binary search to find the maximum possible `x`. It adjusts the range based on the result of `func_3`.
5. **func_5**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x`.

### Correctness and Logic
1. **Tree Representation**: The `Tree` class is assumed to correctly represent the tree structure. The methods `add_edge` and `root_tree_non_recursive` are used to construct and root the tree, respectively.
2. **Traversal and Calculation**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` perform post-order traversals to correctly calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
3. **Binary Search**: `func_4` uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition. The search range is from 1 to `n`, and the mid-point is adjusted based on the result of `func_3`.
4. **Condition Checking**: `func_3` checks the condition by comparing the number of good components and the remaining size against `k` and `x`.

### Conclusion
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. It uses a combination of tree traversal, dynamic programming (via post-order traversal), and binary search to find the maximum `x`. The assumptions about the `Tree` class are reasonable given the context.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
