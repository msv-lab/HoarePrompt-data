The code snippet sets `match_c` to `False`. The other variables (`match_a_b`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value; `match_c` is `False`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0.**
