Postcondition: **`template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 4. If `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `template[i]` in a case-insensitive manner, the program continues. Otherwise, `match_a_b` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
