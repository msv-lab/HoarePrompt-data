The code snippet provided updates the value of the variable `c` by taking a new string input from the user and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace from it. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters (unchanged), `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace.**
