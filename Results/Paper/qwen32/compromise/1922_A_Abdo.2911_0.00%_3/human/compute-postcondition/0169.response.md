Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character, and `i` has completed all iterations from 0 to n-1.**
