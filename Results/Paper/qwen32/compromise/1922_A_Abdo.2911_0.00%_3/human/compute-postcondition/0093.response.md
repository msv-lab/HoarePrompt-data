The provided code snippet initializes an empty list called `template`. None of the other variables (`match_a_b`, `match_c`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) are modified by this code. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `b` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `c` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `template` is an empty list.**
