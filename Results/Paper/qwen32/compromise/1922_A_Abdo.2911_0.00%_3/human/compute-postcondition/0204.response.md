Output State: **`template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `match_a_b` is False; `n` must be greater than 0; `template[i]` is an uppercase character. Additionally, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or both) match `template[i]` when compared in a case-insensitive manner.**

In simpler terms: The value of `match_a_b` has been changed to `False`. All other conditions and variables remain the same.
