Postcondition: **`template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `n` must be greater than 0. If `template[i]` is lowercase and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to False. If `template[i]` is uppercase and neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` match `template[i]` when compared in a case-insensitive manner, `match_a_b` remains True. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True; `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4. If `a[i] != template[i]` or `b[i] != template[i]`, `match_a_b` is False.**
