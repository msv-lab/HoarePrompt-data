The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is nested within, but it will not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `i`, and `n` will remain the same. The condition regarding the characters at index `i` of `template` and `c` will also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False`, `match_c` is `False`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of `template` is a lowercase letter. Additionally, the character at index `i` of `c` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `template`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
