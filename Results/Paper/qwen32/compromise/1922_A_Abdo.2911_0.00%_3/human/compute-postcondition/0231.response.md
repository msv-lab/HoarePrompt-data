Postcondition: **`template` is a list, `i` is an index within the bounds of `template`, and the character at `template[i]` is a lowercase letter. If the character at `c[i]` is not equal to the character at `template[i]`, then `match_c` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_c` retains its original value and no break occurs.**
