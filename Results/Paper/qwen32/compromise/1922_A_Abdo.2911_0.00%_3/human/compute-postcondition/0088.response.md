The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, we only need to consider the variable `t` to determine whether the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have decremented `t` by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `match_a_b` and `match_c` are both True, but these variables are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

State: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True, `t` must be greater than 0**.
