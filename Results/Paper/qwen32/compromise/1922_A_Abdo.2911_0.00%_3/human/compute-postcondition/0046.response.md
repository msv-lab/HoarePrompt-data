Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `template` is a list containing `n` characters, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged and the loop or if statement continues.**
