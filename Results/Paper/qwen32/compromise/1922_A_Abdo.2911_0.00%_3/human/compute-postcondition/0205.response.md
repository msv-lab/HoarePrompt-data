Output State: **`template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `match_a_b` is False; `n` must be greater than 0; `template[i]` is an uppercase character. Additionally, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or both) match `template[i]` when compared in a case-insensitive manner; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `template`, `match_a_b`, `n`, and the condition regarding `template[i]` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
