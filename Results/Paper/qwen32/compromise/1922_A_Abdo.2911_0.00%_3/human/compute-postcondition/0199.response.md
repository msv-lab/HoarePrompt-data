Output State: **`template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `match_a_b` is False; `n` must be greater than 0; the current value of `template[i]` is lowercase; either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `match_a_b` has been changed to `False`. All other conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
