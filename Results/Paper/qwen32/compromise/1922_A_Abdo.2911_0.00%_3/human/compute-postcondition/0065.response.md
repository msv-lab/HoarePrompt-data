The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The value of `n` remains the same as it does not change in the loop head.

State: **`match_a_b` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value. `match_c` is `False` if the lowercase version of the character at index `i` of `c` is equal to the lowercase version of the character at index `i` of `template` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_c` retains its original value. `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0**
