Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `template` includes the character at index 1 of `a`. Otherwise, `template` has an additional element which is the uppercase version of the character at index 1 of `a`.**
