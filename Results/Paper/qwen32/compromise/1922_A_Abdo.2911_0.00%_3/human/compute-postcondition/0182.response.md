The code snippet appends the element at index `i` in list `a` to the list `template`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, except that `template` now includes the new element.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, and the current element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to the current element at index `i` in list `b`; `template` includes the element `a[i]`.**
