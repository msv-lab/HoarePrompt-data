The code snippet provided resets the `template` list to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the new input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, or `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True; `t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0; `n` is the integer value provided by the user input; `b` is the new input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the newly input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is an empty list; `i` has completed all iterations from 0 to n-1.**
