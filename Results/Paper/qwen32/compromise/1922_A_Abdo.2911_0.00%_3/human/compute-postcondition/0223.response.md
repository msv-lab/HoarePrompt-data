Postcondition: **`template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `n` must be greater than 0. `i` is 5, and `n` must be greater than 4. If `template[i]` is lowercase and either `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is uppercase and neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` match `template[i]` in a case-insensitive manner, `match_a_b` is set to False. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True.**
