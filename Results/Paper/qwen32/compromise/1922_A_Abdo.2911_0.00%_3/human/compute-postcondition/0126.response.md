Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character, and `i` is 1.**

Natural language: The value of `match_a_b` has been explicitly set to False. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial values and conditions.
