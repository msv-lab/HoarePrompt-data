Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is the new input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, or `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True; `t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0; `n` is the integer value provided by the user input; `b` is the new input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the newly input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is an empty list; `i` has completed all iterations from 0 to n-1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0. If the current element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to the current element at index `i` in list `b`, `template` includes the element `a[i]`. Otherwise, `template` has an additional element which is the uppercase version of `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `template` includes `a[i]`. Otherwise, `template` has an additional element which is `a[i].upper()`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `template` includes `a[i]`. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `i + 3` and `template` includes `a[i - 1].upper()` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
