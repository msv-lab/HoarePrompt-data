Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length `n`. For each test case, it determines if the string `c` matches a specific template derived from `a` and `b`. The template is created by comparing characters at each position in `a` and `b`; if they match, the character is added in lowercase; if they differ, the character from `a` is added in uppercase. The function then checks if `a` and `b` strictly adhere to this template (lowercase characters must match exactly, and uppercase characters must not match either `a` or `b` at that position), and if `c` does not match the template in the same way `a` and `b` do. If these conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
