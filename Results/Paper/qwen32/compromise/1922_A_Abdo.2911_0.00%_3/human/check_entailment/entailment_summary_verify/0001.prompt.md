You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length `n`. For each test case, it determines if the string `c` matches a specific template derived from `a` and `b`. The template is created by comparing characters at each position in `a` and `b`; if they match, the character is added in lowercase; if they differ, the character from `a` is added in uppercase. The function then checks if `a` and `b` strictly adhere to this template (lowercase characters must match exactly, and uppercase characters must not match either `a` or `b` at that position), and if `c` does not match the template in the same way `a` and `b` do. If these conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
1. We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
   - Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
   - String `c` does not match the template `t`.

2. Conditions for matching:
   - If the `i-th` letter of the template is lowercase, then the `i-th` letter of the string must be the same as the `i-th` letter of the template.
   - If the `i-th` letter of the template is uppercase, then the `i-th` letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the `i-th` letter of the template.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The program iterates through each character of `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it adds that character (lowercase) to the template.
   - If the characters are different, it adds the uppercase version of the character from `a` to the template.

2. **Checking if `a` and `b` match the template**:
   - The program iterates through the template and checks if `a` and `b` match the template according to the rules:
     - If the template character is lowercase, it checks if both `a` and `b` have the same character at that position.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it checks if both `a` and `b` have different characters from the lowercase version of the template character at that position.

3. **Checking if `c` does not match the template**:
   - The program iterates through the template and checks if `c` does not match the template according to the rules:
     - If the template character is lowercase, it checks if `c` has the same character at that position.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it checks if `c` has a different character from the lowercase version of the template character at that position.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Verification:
- The template construction logic is correct. If characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, they must match the template with a lowercase character. If they are different, they must match the template with an uppercase character.
- The matching logic for `a` and `b` is correct. It correctly checks if both strings match the template according to the rules.
- The non-matching logic for `c` is correct. It correctly checks if `c` does not match the template according to the rules.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not match it.

Correctness: **True**
