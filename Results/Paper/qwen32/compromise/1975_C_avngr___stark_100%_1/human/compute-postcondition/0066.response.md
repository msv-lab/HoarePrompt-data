Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is 3, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `max` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` updates the value of `temp` to be a sorted slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 0) to `i + 3`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, and `max` remain unchanged.
