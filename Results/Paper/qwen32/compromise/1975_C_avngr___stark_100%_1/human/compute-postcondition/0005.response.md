To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(a))` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An input integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
2. **n**: An input integer, and currently, its value is 2.
3. **a**: A list of integers that is obtained from the input.

### Analysis:
The `print(min(a))` statement will print the minimum value from the list `a`. However, the specific values of the list `a` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can't determine the exact numerical value that will be printed. 

Given the information, we can describe the output in terms of the list `a`.

### Output Description:
The `print(min(a))` statement will output the minimum value from the list `a`.

Since the exact contents of the list `a` are not specified, the output will depend on the values provided during the execution of the program.

Output: **min(a) (where a is the list of integers obtained from the input)**
