The code snippet `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. Given that `temp` is a slice of the list `a` from index 1 to 3 (`a[1:4]`), sorting `temp` will not affect the original list `a`, but it will change the order of the elements in `temp`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is 3, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `temp` is the sorted list `a[1:4]`, `max` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an input integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is still 3, `a` remains the same as the new list of integers obtained from the input, `_` is still `x + 1` from the previous iteration, `i` is still 1, `temp` is now the sorted version of the slice `a[1:4]`, and `max` remains unchanged.
