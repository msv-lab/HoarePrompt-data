Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. If `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
