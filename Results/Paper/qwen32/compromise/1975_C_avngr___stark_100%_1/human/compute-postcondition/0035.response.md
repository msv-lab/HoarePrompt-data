The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` and takes the next 3 elements, assigning them to the variable `temp`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `max`. The only new variable introduced is `temp`, which holds a slice of the list `a`.

Given that the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we can only say that `temp` will be a slice of `a` starting at index `i` and containing up to 3 elements, depending on the length of `a` and the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `max` is 0, `temp` is a slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
