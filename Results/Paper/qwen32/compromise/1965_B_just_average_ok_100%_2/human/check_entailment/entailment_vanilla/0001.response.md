Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
- There must be no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
- For every integer `v` (where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`), there must be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Analysis of the Given Program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Initial Sequence**:
   - It initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This list represents the binary representation of numbers, which is useful because every number can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2.

3. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than `k`**:
   - It iterates through the list `nums` to find the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`. This is stored in `idx`.

4. **Modifying the Sequence**:
   - It appends three new numbers to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed using the existing elements in `nums`.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that `k + 1` can be formed.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that another number greater than `k` can be formed.
   - It removes the element `1 << idx` from `nums` to avoid forming the sum `k`.

5. **Output**:
   - It prints the length of the modified `nums` list.
   - It prints the elements of the modified `nums` list.

### Evaluation:

- **Subsequences Summing to `v` (where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`)**:
  - The initial sequence of powers of 2 allows forming any sum up to \(2^{21} - 1\) (which is much larger than `n`).
  - By removing `1 << idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that `k` cannot be formed, but other sums remain possible.

- **Size Constraint**:
  - The initial sequence has 21 elements.
  - After modifications, it adds 3 more elements and removes 1, resulting in a maximum of 23 elements, which satisfies the constraint of having a sequence of size at most 25.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
