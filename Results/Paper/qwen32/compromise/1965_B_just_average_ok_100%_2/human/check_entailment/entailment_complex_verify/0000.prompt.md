You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.

        idx = -1

    #State: After all iterations, the loop will have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n` and `k`. It constructs a list `nums` initially containing powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). It then finds the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k` (or sets `idx` to -1 if `k` is greater than \(2^{20}\)). It modifies `nums` by removing this power of 2 and appending three new elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Finally, it prints the length of the modified `nums` list followed by its elements. This process repeats for all `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list of numbers starting with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\), modifies this list based on the value of `k`, and then prints the length of the modified list followed by its elements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee that there will be no subsequence with a sum equal to \( k \). Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The program generates a sequence of powers of 2 up to \( 2^{20} \), then modifies this sequence to include values around \( k \). However, this approach does not ensure that no subsequence sums to \( k \).

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
10 7
```

**Expected Output:**
A sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
- No subsequence sums to 7.
- All subsequences sum to values from 1 to 10 except 7.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
4
1 2 4 13
```

Let's check the subsequences:
- Subsequences that sum to 1: [1]
- Subsequences that sum to 2: [2]
- Subsequences that sum to 3: [1, 2]
- Subsequences that sum to 4: [4]
- Subsequences that sum to 5: [1, 4]
- Subsequences that sum to 6: [2, 4]
- Subsequences that sum to 7: [1, 2, 4]  <-- This is incorrect as it sums to 7.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirement that no subsequence sums to \( k \).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
