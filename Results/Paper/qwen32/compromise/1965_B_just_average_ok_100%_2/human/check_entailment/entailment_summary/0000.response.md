### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **No Subsequence Sum Equals `k`:** The constructed sequence `a` should not have any subsequence whose sum equals `k`.
2. **Subsequences for All Other Values:** For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` except `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initial Sequence Construction:**
   - The program starts by creating a list `nums` containing the first 21 powers of 2 (`[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^20]`). This ensures that all sums of distinct elements from this list are unique and cover a wide range of values.
   
2. **Modification Based on `k`:**
   - It then searches for the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and finds its index `idx`.
   - The element at this index (`1 << idx`) is removed from the list.
   - Three new elements are added to the list:
     - `k - nums[idx]`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`

3. **Ensuring No Subsequence Sums to `k`:**
   - By removing `1 << idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that no combination of elements in the list can sum to `k`. This is because:
     - `k - nums[idx]` is less than `k` and cannot be part of a sum that reaches `k` without including `nums[idx]`.
     - `k + 1` is greater than `k` and thus cannot contribute to a sum of `k`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1` is also greater than `k` and cannot contribute to a sum of `k`.

4. **Ensuring Subsequences for All Other Values:**
   - The initial powers of 2 provide a wide range of sums. The modifications ensure that the specific value `k` is excluded while maintaining the ability to form sums for all other values up to `n`.

#### Testing the Program:
- **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `k = 2`
  - Initial `nums`: `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^20]`
  - Remove `2` (since `2` is the largest power of 2 ≤ `2`).
  - Add `2 - 2 = 0`, `2 + 1 = 3`, `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.
  - Result: `[1, 4, ..., 2^20, 0, 3, 5]`
  - Valid since no subsequence sums to `2`, and `1` can be formed.
  
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 6`, `k = 1`
  - Initial `nums`: `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^20]`
  - Remove `1` (since `1` is the largest power of 2 ≤ `1`).
  - Add `1 - 1 = 0`, `1 + 1 = 2`, `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
  - Result: `[2, 4, ..., 2^20, 0, 2, 3]`
  - Valid since no subsequence sums to `1`, and `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6` can be formed.

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 8`, `k = 8`
  - Initial `nums`: `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^20]`
  - Remove `4` (since `4` is the largest power of 2 ≤ `8`).
  - Add `8 - 4 = 4`, `8 + 1 = 9`, `8 + 4 + 1 = 13`.
  - Result: `[1, 2, 8, 16, ..., 2^20, 4, 9, 13]`
  - Valid since no subsequence sums to `8`, and `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7` can be formed.

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 9`, `k = 3`
  - Initial `nums`: `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^20]`
  - Remove `2` (since `2` is the largest power of 2 ≤ `3`).
  - Add `3 - 2 = 1`, `3 + 1 = 4`, `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`.
  - Result: `[1, 4, 8, ..., 2^20, 1, 4, 6]`
  - Valid since no subsequence sums to `3`, and `1`, `2`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9` can be formed.

- **Test Case 5:** `n = 10`, `k = 7`
  - Initial `nums`: `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^20]`
  - Remove `4` (since `4` is the largest power of 2 ≤ `7`).
  - Add `7 - 4 = 3`, `7 + 1 = 8`, `7 + 4 + 1 = 12`.
  - Result: `[1, 2, 8, 16, ..., 2^20, 3, 8, 12]`
  - Valid since no subsequence sums to `7`, and `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `8`, `9`, `10` can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs sequences that meet the problem's requirements for all provided test cases.
