The code removes the element at the position `idx` from the list `nums`. Given that `nums[idx]` is `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to \(2^{idx}\)), the element removed will be \(2^{idx}\).

Since `nums` initially contains the sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`], removing `nums[idx]` means removing \(2^{idx}\) from this list.

Therefore, the new `nums` list will be missing the element \(2^{idx}\), while all other elements, including `t`, `n`, `k`, and `idx`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `idx` is the index of the largest element in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or 20 if `k` is greater than 1048576; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`] with `2^idx` removed.**
