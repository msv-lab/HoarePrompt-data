Let's analyze the loop to understand how the variables change based on the provided initial state and the loop's logic.

### Initial State:
- `arr`: A list of integers (not specified, so we'll consider a generic list for the explanation)
- `new_segment`: An empty list
- `max_segment`: `[0, 0]`
- `segments_variants`: An empty list
- `max_sum`: -1

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr` using the index `i`.
2. **First Iteration**:
   - If `arr[i] >= 0`, `new_segment` is initialized with `[arr[i], i]`.
   - `max_segment[0]` is updated to `arr[i]` (since `max_segment` was `[0, 0]` initially, `max_segment[0]` becomes `arr[i]`).
3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - If `new_segment` is not empty:
     - If `arr[i] < 0`, the current segment is evaluated:
       - If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `max_segment` is appended to `segments_variants` with the end index `i - 1`.
       - Otherwise, `new_segment` is appended to `segments_variants` with the end index `i - 1`, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`.
       - `new_segment` is reset to an empty list.
       - `max_segment[0]` is updated by adding `arr[i]` (which is negative).
     - If `arr[i] >= 0`, both `new_segment[0]` and `max_segment[0]` are updated by adding `arr[i]`.
4. **Final Iteration**:
   - If `arr[i]` is negative and `new_segment` is not empty, the last segment is evaluated and potentially added to `segments_variants`.
   - If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` and `max_segment` are updated as usual.

### Final State:
- After the loop completes, `new_segment` will be empty because the loop resets `new_segment` whenever a negative number is encountered.
- `max_segment` will hold the maximum sum segment encountered during the loop, with the sum as the first element and the end index as the second element.
- `segments_variants` will contain all the segments that were considered as potential maximum segments.
- `max_sum` remains unchanged at -1 because it is not modified within the loop.

### Output State:
The output state will depend on the specific values in `arr`, but the structure of the output state will be:

- `new_segment`: An empty list
- `max_segment`: A list containing the maximum sum of a segment and its end index
- `segments_variants`: A list of lists, each containing a segment sum and its end index
- `max_sum`: -1 (unchanged)

Given the generic nature of `arr`, we cannot specify the exact values of `max_segment` and `segments_variants`, but we can describe them in a general sense.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **new_segment: [], max_segment: [max_sum_of_segment, end_index_of_segment], segments_variants: [[sum1, end_index1], [sum2, end_index2], ...], max_sum: -1**
