Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully implement the solution for the problem described. The code includes three functions, but only the first two (`func_1` and `func_2`) are defined, and the third function (`func_3`) is incomplete. Additionally, the logic provided does not seem to correctly address the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incomplete Function (`func_3`)**: The third function `func_3` is defined but not implemented. It is supposed to compute the final answer based on the number and the quantity, but it currently does nothing and just returns `0`.

2. **Logic for Maximum Sum Calculation**: The function `func_2` is supposed to find the maximum segment sum in the array, but it does not correctly handle all cases. It seems to be attempting to find the maximum subarray sum, but it does not handle negative numbers properly and does not account for the fact that we can insert the sum of any subarray (including an empty subarray) `k` times to maximize the sum.

3. **Modulo Operation**: While `func_1` correctly computes the modulo operation, it is not used in the rest of the code to ensure that the final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The code does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It does not read input for multiple test cases and does not process each test case independently.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Read input for multiple test cases.
- For each test case, find the maximum subarray sum using an algorithm like Kadane's.
- Use this maximum subarray sum to determine the best strategy for inserting sums of subarrays `k` times.
- Ensure that the final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the current state of the code, it is not correct for the problem as described.
