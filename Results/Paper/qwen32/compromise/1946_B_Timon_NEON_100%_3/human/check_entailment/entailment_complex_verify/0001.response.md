### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the code, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, summing its elements, and inserting the sum anywhere in the array. The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Maximizing the Sum**: The optimal strategy is to repeatedly add the sum of the maximum contiguous subarray (using Kadane's algorithm) to the array. If the maximum contiguous subarray sum is non-positive, adding zero (from an empty subarray) is better.
2. **Modulo Operation**: The result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given number.
   - **Correct**: The function works as intended.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function is intended to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum and its indices.
   - **Incorrect Handling of Segments**:
     - The logic for handling segments and updating `max_segment` is flawed.
     - The function does not correctly manage the transition between segments and does not correctly append the last segment to `segments_variants`.
     - The logic for determining `total_max_segment` is incorrect.
   - **Specific Issues**:
     - The function does not handle the case where the array contains all negative numbers or zeros properly.
     - The function does not correctly update `max_segment` when a new positive number is encountered.
     - The function incorrectly handles the end of the array.
   - **Conclusion**: The function does not correctly implement Kadane's algorithm or handle all edge cases.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - The function is incomplete and does not implement the logic to perform the operations and compute the final sum.
   - **Incorrect**: The function is not used in the main code and is not implemented correctly.

#### Main Code:
- The main code reads the input, calls `func_2` to find the maximum contiguous subarray, and then computes the final answer.
- **Issue**: The main code relies on `func_2` to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum, but `func_2` is incorrect.
- **Incorrect Calculation**:
  - The formula used to compute the final answer (`max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`) is incorrect.
  - The formula does not correctly account for the fact that the maximum subarray sum should be added `k` times optimally.
  - The formula does not handle the case where the maximum subarray sum is non-positive correctly.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It has several logical errors and does not handle all edge cases properly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**
