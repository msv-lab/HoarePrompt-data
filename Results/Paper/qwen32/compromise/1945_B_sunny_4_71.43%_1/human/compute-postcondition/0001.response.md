In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute `t` times. The value of `t` is already given as an integer read from input, and it is within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already defined and within the valid range, the only thing we need to ensure is that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. It is simply used to iterate `t` times.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute, given that `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
