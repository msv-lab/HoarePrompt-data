### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Provided Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)
```

#### Annotations:
1. The program reads the input values and calls `func_1` for each test case.
2. Inside `func_1`, it initializes an empty list `b` and two pointers `l` and `r` to traverse the array `a` based on the commands 'L' and 'R'.
3. It constructs the list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands.
4. After constructing `b`, it calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the result modulo `m`, and stores these results in `ans`.
5. Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans`.

#### Original Assessment:
- The assessment states that the program does not correctly compute the product of the array elements and take the remainder as per the problem description.
- It claims that the program incorrectly constructs the array `b` and calculates the product in reverse order, which is not what is required.

#### Analysis:
1. **Incorrect Construction of `b`**: The list `b` is constructed by appending elements from `a` based on the commands 'L' and 'R'. However, this list `b` does not represent the current state of the array `a` after each command.
2. **Incorrect Product Calculation**: The product is calculated after constructing `b` and then taking the product of elements in `b` in reverse order. This does not match the requirement of calculating the product of the current state of `a` after each command.
3. **Incorrect Output**: The output should be the remainder of the product of the current array state after each command, not the remainder of the product of elements in `b`.

The original assessment is correct in identifying these issues. The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The corrected version provided in the assessment correctly calculates the product of the current array state after each command and outputs the remainder when divided by `m`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
