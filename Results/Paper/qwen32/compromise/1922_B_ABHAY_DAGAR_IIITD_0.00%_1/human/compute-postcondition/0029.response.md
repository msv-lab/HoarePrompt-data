The code snippet provided increments the value of `total_count` by the value of `cnt`. No other variables are directly modified by this line of code, and the conditions or states of other variables remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
