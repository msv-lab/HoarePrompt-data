Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt`, `cnt` is `cnt_next`.**

Explanation: The value of `total_count` is incremented by `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is updated to `cnt_next`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
