The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `res` with the value `0`. This does not affect the existing variables `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, or `num_of_lens`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `num_list` and values as their respective counts, `res` is 0.**
