The code snippet provided updates the variable `res` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. This expression calculates a combinatorial value representing the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of `cnt` elements, which is then added to `res`.

Hereâ€™s the updated state of the variables:

- `test_cases`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet.
- `results`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet.
- `n`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet.
- `num_list`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet.
- `num_of_lens`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet.
- `total_count`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet.
- `cnt`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet.
- `res`: Is updated to its previous value plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is updated to `res` + `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.**
