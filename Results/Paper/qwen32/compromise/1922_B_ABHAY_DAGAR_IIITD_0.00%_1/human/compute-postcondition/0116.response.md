The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `cnt` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` has taken on the value of one of the counts from `num_of_lens`. To execute the loop one more time, `cnt` should take on the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.

Let's denote the current value of `cnt` as `cnt_current`. The next value in the iteration will be the next count in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Since we do not have the exact values of `num_of_lens`, we can denote the next value as `cnt_next`.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt_current`. If `cnt_current` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is unchanged. Otherwise, `res` remains 0, `cnt` is `cnt_next`**.
