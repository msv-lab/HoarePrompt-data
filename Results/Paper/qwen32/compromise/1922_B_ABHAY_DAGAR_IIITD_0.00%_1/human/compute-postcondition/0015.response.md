The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `num_list`. If there are more elements in `num_list` to be processed, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the last processed element in `num_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must have at least one more element that has not been processed yet.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary. If `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a count of 1. `x` is the next element in `num_list` after the previously processed element.**
