The code snippet only initializes a new variable `total_count` to 0. It does not affect the values of the existing variables `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, or `res`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `num_list` and values as their respective counts, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0.**
