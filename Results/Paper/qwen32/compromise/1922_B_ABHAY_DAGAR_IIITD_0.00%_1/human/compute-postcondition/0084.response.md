Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples; `results` is a list containing `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `results` remains `res`; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values (and must have at least one key-value pair); `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`; `cnt` is `cnt_next`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` before the given code snippet; `total_count` is now `total_count + cnt`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `total_count` has been increased by the value of `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged.
