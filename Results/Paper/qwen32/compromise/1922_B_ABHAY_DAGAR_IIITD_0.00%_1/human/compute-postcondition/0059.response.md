Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer remaining, `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 items from counts `cnt >= 3` and all combinations of 2 items from counts `cnt >= 2` multiplied by the cumulative `total_count` at that point, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` must be greater than the current iteration count, and `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, reflecting that the element `x` from `num_list` has been counted one more time. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
