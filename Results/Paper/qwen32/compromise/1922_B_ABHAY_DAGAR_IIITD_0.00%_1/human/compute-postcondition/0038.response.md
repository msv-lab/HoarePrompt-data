Postcondition: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is unchanged from the previous iteration. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.**
