The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. This means that if `x` was not already a key in `num_of_lens`, it will now be with the value `1`. If `x` was already a key, its value will be overwritten to `1`.

Given the initial state, the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, and `x` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `num_of_lens` dictionary.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least two integers, `x` is the next element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens[x]` is 1.**
