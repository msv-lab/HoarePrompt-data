In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `cnt`, and it iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair, meaning that there must be at least one unique integer in `num_list`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`cnt`**: This is the loop variable and will be assigned the values from `num_of_lens.values()` during each iteration. It does not need to be initialized before the loop starts because it is automatically assigned a value from the dictionary during the first iteration.

2. **`num_of_lens`**: This dictionary must have at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute. This means `num_list` must contain at least one integer.

3. **Other variables**: The variables `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `res`, and `total_count` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted specifically for the loop to execute. However, they are part of the program state and their values should be consistent with the requirements of the program.

Given the above, the adjusted state for the loop to execute would be:

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values (and must have at least one key-value pair), `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, and `test_cases` must be greater than the current iteration count.**

Since the loop's execution depends on `num_of_lens` having at least one key-value pair, we ensure `num_list` has at least one integer to satisfy this condition.
