The code snippet `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` increments the value of `res` by the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time, which is calculated as `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.

Given the initial state, `res` is initially 0, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. After executing the code, `res` will be updated to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, and `total_count`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is 0, `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**
