Output State: **if `lex` was less than 27, `arr` is `[1, 26]`; if `lex` was between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]`; if `lex` was greater than 78, `arr` is `[26]`; `lex` is now `lex - 26`; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged; `j` is 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `lex` has been decreased by 26. The conditions for `arr` remain the same based on the original value of `lex`. All other variables (`info`, `i`, `cases`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
