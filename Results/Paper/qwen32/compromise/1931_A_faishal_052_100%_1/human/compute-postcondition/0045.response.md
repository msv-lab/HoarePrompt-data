The code snippet `arr = []` reassigns the variable `arr` to an empty list. This means that the previous state of `arr` being sorted in ascending order and including the element `lex` is no longer valid. The other variables (`lex`, `info`, `i`, `cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is an empty list; `lex` is unchanged; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged.**
