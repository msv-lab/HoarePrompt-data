The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Given the initial conditions, `arr` could have one of several possible initial states based on the value of `lex`. After appending `26`, the new state of `arr` will be:

- If `lex` was originally less than 26, `arr` was `[1, 1]` and now becomes `[1, 1, 26]`.
- If `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77, `arr` was `[26, 1]` and now becomes `[26, 1, 26]`.
- If `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78, `arr` was `[1]` and now becomes `[1, 26]`.
- If `lex - 26` is less than 27, `arr` was `[1, 26]` and now becomes `[1, 26, 26]`.
- If `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, `arr` was `[26, 26]` and now becomes `[26, 26, 26]`.
- If `lex - 26` is greater than 78, `arr` was `[26]` and now becomes `[26, 26]`.

Other variables (`lex`, `info`, `i`, `cases`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` was originally less than 26, `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77, `[1, 26]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78, `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is less than 27, `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, and `[26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78; `lex` is an integer that has been decremented by 1 if it was originally less than 28, and reduced by 26 if it was originally less than or equal to 78; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged; `j` is 2.**
