Output State: **`arr` is `[1]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an input integer and the current value of `lex` is less than 27.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` has been decremented by 1, so if it was initially less than 28, it is now less than 27. The other variables remain unchanged.
