Output State: **`arr` is `[26]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 26 and less than or equal to 52.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26, so if `lex` was originally between 52 and 78, it is now between 26 and 52. The values of `arr`, `info` (except for the last element which includes `lex`), and `i` remain unchanged.
