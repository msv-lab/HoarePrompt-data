Given the initial state and the operation `lex = lex - 26`, we need to determine the new state of `lex` and how it affects the array `arr`. Here's the breakdown:

- If `lex` was originally less than 26, it would have been decremented by 1, making it less than 25. After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` would be negative.
- If `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77, it would have been reduced by 26, making it between -25 and 25 inclusive or between 26 and 51 inclusive. After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` would be between -51 and -1 inclusive or between 0 and 25 inclusive.
- If `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78, it would have been reduced by 26, making it 51 or 52. After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` would be 25 or 26.
- If `lex - 26` was less than 27 (meaning `lex` was less than 53), `lex` would be between -25 and 26. After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` would be between -51 and 0.
- If `lex - 26` was between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78 (meaning `lex` was between 28 and 79), `lex` would be between -24 and 26 or between 27 and 52. After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` would be between -24 and 0 or between 1 and 26.
- If `lex - 26` was greater than 78 (meaning `lex` was greater than 104), `lex` would be greater than 78. After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` would be greater than 52.

The array `arr` is dependent on the original value of `lex` before the decrement. Since the decrement does not affect the conditions used to determine `arr`, `arr` remains unchanged.

The other variables (`info`, `i`, `cases`, `j`) are not affected by the operation `lex = lex - 26`.

Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` was originally less than 26; `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77; `[1, 26]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78; `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` was less than 27; `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78; `[26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78; `lex` is now `lex - 26`; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged; `j` is 2.**
