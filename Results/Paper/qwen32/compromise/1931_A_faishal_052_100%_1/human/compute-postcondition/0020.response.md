The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will execute twice for `j = 0` and `j = 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78
- `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
- `info` is an empty list
- `lex` is an input integer
- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is a list containing the integer 1.
- If `lex` is 28 or greater, `arr` is [26] if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `arr` remains an empty list.

Since the loop iterates over `range(2)`, the value of `j` at the start of the first iteration would be 0, and at the start of the second iteration, it would be 1.

If this is the start of the second iteration, then `j` should be 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer, `arr` is determined based on the value of `lex` as described, `j` is 1**
