The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `cases`. This means that `cases` will now hold the integer value provided by the user input. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78; `cases` is an input integer.**
