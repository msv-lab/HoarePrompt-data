The code appends the integer `26` to the list `arr`. Given the initial conditions:

- If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` initially contains `[1]`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[1, 26]`.
- If `lex` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, `arr` initially contains `26`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` initially is an empty list. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26]`.

Other variables (`lex`, `info`, `i`, `cases`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **if `lex` is less than 27, `arr` is `[1, 26]`; if `lex` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]`; if `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26]`; `lex` is an integer; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged; `j` is 1.**
