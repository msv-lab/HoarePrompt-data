The only variables in the loop head are `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `temp` is the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`; `j` is 1.**
