The given code snippet appends the variable `lex` to the list `arr`. Since the initial state only specifies the contents of `arr` as `[26, 26]` and does not specify the value of `lex`, we cannot determine the exact new contents of `arr` without knowing `lex`. However, we can express the new state in terms of `lex`.

Output State: **`arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`**.
