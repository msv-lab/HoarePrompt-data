Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was originally less than 26, `[26, 1, 1]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77, `[1, 1]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78, `[1, 26, 1]` if `lex - 26` is less than 27, `[26, 26, 1]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, `[26, 1]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78; `lex` is an integer that has been decremented by 2 if it was originally less than 28, and reduced by 27 if it was originally less than or equal to 78; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged; `j` is 2**.

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `lex` is further decremented by 1. This means if `lex` was originally less than 28, it is now decremented by 2 from its original value. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 78, it is now reduced by 27 from its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
