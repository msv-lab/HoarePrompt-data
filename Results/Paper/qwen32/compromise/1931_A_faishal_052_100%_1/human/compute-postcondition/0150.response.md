The code snippet initializes a new variable `temp` with an empty string. This does not affect the existing variables `info`, `cases`, `t`, `n`, or `i`. The values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `temp` is an empty string.**
