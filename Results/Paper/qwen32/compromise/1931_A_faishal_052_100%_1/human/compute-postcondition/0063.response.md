The code appends the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Given the initial conditions, `arr` could initially be `[1]`, `[26]`, or `[]` depending on the value of `lex`. After appending `1`, the new state of `arr` will be `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[1]` respectively.

Other variables (`lex`, `info`, `i`, `cases`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 1]` if `lex` is less than 27, `arr` is `[26, 1]` if `lex` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, `arr` is `[1]` if `lex` is greater than 78; `lex` is an integer; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged; `j` is 1.**
