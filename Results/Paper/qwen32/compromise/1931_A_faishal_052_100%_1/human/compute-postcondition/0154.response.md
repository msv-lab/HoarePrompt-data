The code modifies the `temp` variable by appending the ASCII character corresponding to `info[i][j] + 96` to its current value. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, the new character added to `temp` is derived from `info[2][1] + 96`.

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `temp` is the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96` concatenated with the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][1] + 96`; `j` is 1.**

In simpler terms, `temp` now includes an additional character based on the value of `info[2][1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
