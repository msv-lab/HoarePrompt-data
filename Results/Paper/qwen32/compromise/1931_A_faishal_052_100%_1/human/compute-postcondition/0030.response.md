The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.

However, since the loop condition `j in range(2)` means it will stop once `j` reaches 2, the loop will not execute again after `j` is incremented to 2. Therefore, we only need to adjust `j` to its next value within the range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2**
