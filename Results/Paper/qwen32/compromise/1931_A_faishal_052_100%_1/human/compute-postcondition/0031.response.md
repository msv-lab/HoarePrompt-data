The given code snippet appends the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `arr`, we assume it could be any list prior to this operation. After appending `1`, the list `arr` will have `1` as its last element.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `arr` has `1` appended to it.**
