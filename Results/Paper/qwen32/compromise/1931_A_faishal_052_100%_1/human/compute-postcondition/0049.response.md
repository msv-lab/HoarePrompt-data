Output State: **`arr` is a list containing one element `[1]`; `lex` is an input integer with a value less than 28; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The list `arr` was initially empty and now contains one element, which is the integer `1`. All other variables (`lex`, `info`, `i`, and `cases`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
