Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is an empty list, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is a list containing the integer 1. If `lex` is 28 or greater, `arr` is [26] if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `arr` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `info` is a list containing the single element `[1]` and `lex` is decreased by 1. If `lex` was initially 28 or more, `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` was initially less than 52, `info` is a list containing `[26]`. If `lex` was initially 52 or more, `info` remains an empty list. If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 78, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 2. If `lex` was originally less than 28, `arr` has `1` appended to it, and `lex` is decreased by 1. If `lex` was originally 28 or more but less than 52, `arr` contains `26` appended to it, and `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` was originally 52 or more but less than or equal to 78, `arr` includes `26` as its last element and `lex` is decreased by 26.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
