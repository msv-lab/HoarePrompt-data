Given the initial state and the operation `lex = lex - 26`, let's determine the new state of the variables:

- If `lex` was initially less than 27, subtracting 26 would make `lex` negative or zero.
- If `lex` was initially between 2 and 52 inclusive, subtracting 26 would make `lex` between -24 and 26 inclusive.
- If `lex` was initially between 53 and 78, subtracting 26 would make `lex` between 27 and 52 inclusive.
- If `lex` was initially greater than 78, subtracting 26 would make `lex` greater than 52.

The array `arr` and the rest of the variables (`info`, `i`, `cases`, `j`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a list that contains two elements `[1, 26]` if `lex` (after subtraction) is less than 27, contains the integers `[26, 26]` if `lex` (after subtraction) is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, and is a list containing only the integer `[26]` if `lex` (after subtraction) is greater than 78; `lex` is an integer that has been reduced by 26; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged; `j` is 1.**
