The function `func_3` takes two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob. It calculates a sum, `sub_summ`, by adding the first element of each tuple in `sec_arr` and the sum of both elements of each tuple in `main_ar` where the sum of the tuple's elements is non-negative. The function returns this calculated sum.
