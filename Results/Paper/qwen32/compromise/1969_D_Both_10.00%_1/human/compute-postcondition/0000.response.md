Output State: **main_ar and sec_arr are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. Each tuple in main_ar and sec_arr represents the prices (a_i, b_i) of an item for Alice and Bob, respectively. `sub_summ` is 0.**

In simple terms: The lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged, and a new variable `sub_summ` is initialized to 0.
