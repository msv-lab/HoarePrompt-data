To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider how the loop processes each tuple in `main_ar`. The loop iterates over each tuple `val_b` in `main_ar`, and if the sum of the first and second elements of `val_b` is non-negative, it adds this sum to `sub_summ`.

Let's summarize the process:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `main_ar`: A list of tuples.
   - `sec_arr`: A list of tuples.
   - `sub_summ`: The sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each tuple `val_b` in `main_ar`, if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, then `sub_summ` is incremented by `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - `main_ar` remains unchanged.
   - `sec_arr` remains unchanged.
   - `sub_summ` is the sum of its initial value and the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for each tuple `val_b` in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.

**Output State: **main_ar** remains the same, **sec_arr** remains the same, and **sub_summ** is the initial sum of the first elements of all tuples in **sec_arr** plus the sum of **val_b[0] + val_b[1]** for each tuple **val_b** in **main_ar** where **val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0**.**

In simpler terms, `sub_summ` is updated by adding the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` that meets the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. The lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
