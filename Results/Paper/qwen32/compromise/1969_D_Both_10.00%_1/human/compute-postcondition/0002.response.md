The code snippet `sub_summ += val_a[0]` increments the variable `sub_summ` by the first element of the tuple `val_a`. Given the initial state, `sub_summ` is initially 0. After the execution of the code, `sub_summ` will be equal to the first element of `val_a`.

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `sub_summ` is `val_a[0]`**.
