The code snippet provided increments `sub_summ` by the sum of the first two elements of the tuple `val_b`. Given the initial state, `sub_summ` is initially the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`, and `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`. After the code execution, `sub_summ` will be updated to include the sum of the first two elements of `val_b`.

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`, `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`.**
