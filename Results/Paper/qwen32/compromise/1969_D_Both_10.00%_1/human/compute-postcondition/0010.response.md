The value of `sub_summ` is updated by adding the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]` to its current value. The precondition that `main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, and `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` still holds. Additionally, the condition that `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0 remains valid.

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`.**
