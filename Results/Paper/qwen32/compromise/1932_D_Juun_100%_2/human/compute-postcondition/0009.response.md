Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list of strings representing pairs of cards from non-trump suits and trump suits, `suits` is unchanged.**

Explanation: Since `trumps` is an empty list, sorting it in reverse order does not change its value. Therefore, `trumps` remains an empty list. The `answers` list and `suits` variable are not affected by this operation.
