In the provided for loop, the loop head contains only the variable `i` and the function `input()`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `input()`, which is expected to be an integer representing the number of test cases (`t`).

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the input to the loop is valid for the loop to execute. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `int(input())` times. This means the input should be a valid integer.
2. The variable `i` is used as the loop variable and will iterate from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.
3. The state before the loop starts includes the information about `t`, `x`, and `y`, but these do not directly influence the loop's execution. The loop's execution depends on the value of `t` (which is input during the loop's start).

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, we need to ensure that the input function returns this value `t` for the loop to execute `t` times.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `input()` returns `t`, and for each of the `t` test cases, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9.**

Since only the objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the loop head involves `i` and `input()`, we adjust the state of `input()` to return `t`.

State: **`input()` returns `t`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
