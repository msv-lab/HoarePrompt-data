The value of `next_max_diff` is updated to the value of `diff`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is -inf, `k` is -inf, `A` is initialized, `D` is -inf, `F` is -inf, `max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains unchanged, `next_max_diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `index` is set to 2 if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` remains `None`, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`**.
