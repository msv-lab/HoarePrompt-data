Functionality: **The function calculates and prints the maximum of two values: the largest difference between consecutive elements in a sorted list `A`, and a computed value `ans` that is derived from the elements of `A`, `D`, and `F`. The function does not modify the input lists `A`, `D`, or `F`, and it does not return any value; instead, it prints the result.**
