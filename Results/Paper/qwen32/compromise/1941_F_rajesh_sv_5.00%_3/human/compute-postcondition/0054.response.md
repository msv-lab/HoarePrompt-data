Postcondition: **`max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair that gives the largest difference, `n`, `m`, `k` are unchanged, `A` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, `D` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, `F` must contain at least one element, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `h` must be greater than `2`, `mid` is `2 + (h - 2) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `5 + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `7 + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `l` remains `2`.**
