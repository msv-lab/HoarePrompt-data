Given the initial state and the code snippet, the value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is defined as `h // 2`, and there's no specific value given for `h`, we'll keep `mid` as `h // 2`. Therefore, `l` becomes `(h // 2) + 1`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`max_diff` is 2, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in A, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair that gives the largest difference, `A` is [1, 3, 5, 7], `D` is [1, 3, 5, 7], `F` must contain at least two elements, `left` is 1, `right` is 3, `ans` is 2, `h` must be greater than 0, `mid` is `h // 2`, `mid_sum` is `5 + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `7 + f`, `l` is `(h // 2) + 1`.**
