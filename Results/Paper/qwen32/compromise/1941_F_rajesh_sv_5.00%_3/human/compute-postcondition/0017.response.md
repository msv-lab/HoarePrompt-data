Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is -inf, `k` is -inf, `A` is initialized, `D` is -inf, `F` is -inf, `max_diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is -inf, `index` is `None`, `i` is 2, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `max_diff` has been updated to be equal to `diff`, which is `A[2] - A[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
