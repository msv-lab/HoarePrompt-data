Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F` are initialized to `-inf`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `next_max_diff` remains `-inf`, and `index` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains unchanged, `index` remains `None`, and if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.**
