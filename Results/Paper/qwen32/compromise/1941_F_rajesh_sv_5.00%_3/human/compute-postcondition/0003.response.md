The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `testcases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0. After one iteration, `testcases` is decremented by 1 (since the loop iterates `testcases` times).

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must still be greater than 0 after the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `testcases` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 1 and must be greater than 0. The function `func_6()` has been executed.**
