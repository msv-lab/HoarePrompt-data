t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5, followed by k lists of n integers each, representing the order of participants seen in the screenshots. Each list contains distinct integers from 1 to n, with the first integer in each list representing the participant who took the screenshot and is always at the top of the list.
