Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` is updated based on conditions, `l22` is updated based on conditions, `idx1` is updated based on conditions, `idx2` is updated based on conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is updated based on conditions, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.**

Natural Language: The variable `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l3` is assigned the list of the remaining integers from the input. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, and `l`) remain unchanged or are updated based on their respective conditions.
