The code snippet `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a tuple containing `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. This means that `val` will now include this new tuple, while all other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` remains unchanged, `m` is 2 if the initial `m` was 2, otherwise `m` remains unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` and `l22` remain the same unless `a2` is inserted into `l2` in the else part, `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` if such a pair is found, otherwise they are -1, `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` were encountered, otherwise they are 0, `val` is a list containing an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers. Additionally, if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `idx2` and `l` becomes `l1`. Otherwise, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1` and `l` becomes `l2`.**

In simpler terms, `val` now includes a new tuple with `a3` and `l3`, while all other variables retain their previous values unless they were modified by the conditions described.
