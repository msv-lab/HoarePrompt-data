The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('no')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'no'`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, and `l` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string `'no'` is explicitly stated and does not rely on any of these variables.

Output: **no**
