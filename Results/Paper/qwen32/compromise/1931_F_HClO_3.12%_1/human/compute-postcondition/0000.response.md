Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the k lines following the description of each test case contains n distinct integers a_{ij} each (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n), where a_{i0} is the author of the screenshot and is always at the top of the list. All authors of the screenshots are different.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. The other variables and conditions provided in the initial state remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
