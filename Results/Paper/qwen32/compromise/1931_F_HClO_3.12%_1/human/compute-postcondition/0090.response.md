The code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` at the index `idx2` in the list `l1`. This means that `l1` will have one more element, and the elements at and after `idx2` will be shifted one position to the right.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2` (note that `l11` may have changed since `l1` has changed); `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-2` or the index where the loop broke early; `idx1` and `idx2` are the indices where `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` or `-1` if no such pair is found; `p1` and `p2` are `1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered, otherwise `0`; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a3`; the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**

In simpler terms, `l1` now includes `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`, and other variables remain unchanged.
