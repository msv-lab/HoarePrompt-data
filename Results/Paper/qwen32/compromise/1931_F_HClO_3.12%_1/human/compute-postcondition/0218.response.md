The code snippet provided decrements the value of `m` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1` with `a1` inserted at the position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if the index of `a2` in `l3` is less than or equal to the index of `a1` in `l3`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2` (before the insertion); `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-1`; `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`; `l` is a list of integers from `l1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from `l2`; `_` is 1 if `l11 == l22`, otherwise `_` is `m-2`; `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`; the loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet. If `m` is 2, the state of the variables remains as described above. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition. `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a3`.**
