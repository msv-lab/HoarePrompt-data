The code snippet provided creates a new list `l22` by filtering out all occurrences of `a1` from the existing list `l2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, and `l2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed.**
