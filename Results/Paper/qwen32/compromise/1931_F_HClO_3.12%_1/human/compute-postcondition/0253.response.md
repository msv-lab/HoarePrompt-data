The code provided is attempting to create a new list `l11` by filtering out all occurrences of `a2` from the list `l1`. However, the list `l1` is not defined in the initial state or the given code snippet. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the exact contents of `l11` without this information. Assuming `l1` was intended to be `l2` (the list of remaining integers from the new input line), the code would filter out all occurrences of `a2` from `l2`.

Given this assumption, the output state would be:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains 1. The integers `n` and `m` provided by the input remain unchanged. The variable `a1` retains its value as the first integer from the input line. The variable `a2` retains its value as the first integer from the new input line. The list `l2` is transformed into `l11` by removing all occurrences of `a2`.
