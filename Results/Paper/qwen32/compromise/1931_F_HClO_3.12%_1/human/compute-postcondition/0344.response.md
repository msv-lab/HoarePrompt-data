The code snippet provided appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Given the initial state, `val` was an empty list if `idx1 <= idx2`, and it was a list containing tuples if `idx1 > idx2`. After executing the code, `val` will now contain at least one tuple, specifically `(a3, l3)`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains 1.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged unless `m` was 2 in which case `m` becomes 1. Since `m` must be greater than 2, `m` remains unchanged.
- `a1` and `a2` remain the same.
- `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`; otherwise, it remains unchanged or gets modified in the else part.
- `l22` remains the same unless `a2` was inserted into `l2` in the else part.
- `idx1` is incremented by 1 if `idx1 > idx2`; otherwise, it remains the same.
- `idx2` is `idx2 + 1` if `idx1 < idx2`; otherwise, it is reset to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1` if such a pair is found, otherwise it is -1.
- `p1` and `p2` remain the same.
- `val` now contains an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`.
- `l` becomes `l1` if `idx1 > idx2`; otherwise, it becomes `l2` with the conditions specified for `a1` and `a2` insertion.
- `a3` is the first integer from the input.
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` is updated based on conditions, `l22` is updated based on conditions, `idx1` is updated based on conditions, `idx2` is updated based on conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is updated based on conditions, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.**
