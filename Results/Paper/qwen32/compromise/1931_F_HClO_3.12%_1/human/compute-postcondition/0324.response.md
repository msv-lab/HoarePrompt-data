The code snippet provided is `l = l1`, which assigns the value of `l1` to the variable `l`. Since `l1` is not mentioned in the initial state, we can assume that `l1` is a variable that holds some value, and this value is now assigned to `l`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the same, `m` is the same, `a1` is the same, `a2` is the same, `l2` is the same, `l22` is the same, `idx1` is `idx1 + 1`, `idx2` is the same, `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` were encountered, otherwise they are 0, `val` is an empty list, `l` is the value of `l1`.**
