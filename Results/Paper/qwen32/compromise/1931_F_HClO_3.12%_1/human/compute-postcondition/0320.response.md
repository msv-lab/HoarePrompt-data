Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the same, `m` is the same, `a1` is the same, `a2` is the same, `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1`, `l22` is the same, `idx1` is the same, `idx2` is `idx2 + 1`, `p1` is the same, `p2` is the same, `val` is an empty list, `l` is the same as `l2`**

In simple terms, the variable `l` is now assigned the same value as `l2`, which has `a2` inserted at `idx1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
