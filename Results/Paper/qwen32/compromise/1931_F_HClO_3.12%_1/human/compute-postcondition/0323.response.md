The code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` at the position `idx2` in the list `l1`. Since `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, the index `idx1` will be incremented by 1 because of the insertion, while `idx2` remains the same. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the same, `m` is the same, `a1` is the same, `a2` is the same, `l2` is the same, `l22` is the same, `idx1` is `idx1 + 1`, `idx2` is the same, `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` were encountered, otherwise they are 0, `val` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at the position `idx2`, shifting all elements from `idx2` to the right by one position, thus incrementing `idx1` by 1. All other variables retain their original values.
