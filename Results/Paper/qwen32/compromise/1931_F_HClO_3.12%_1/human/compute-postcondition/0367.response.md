Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the total number of screenshots and `k` is the number of screenshots for which the author is specified. Following these, for each of the `k` test cases, it accepts a list of `n` distinct integers `a_{ij}` where `a_{i0}` is the author of the screenshot. The function returns a value indicating the author of each screenshot for all `t` test cases.**
