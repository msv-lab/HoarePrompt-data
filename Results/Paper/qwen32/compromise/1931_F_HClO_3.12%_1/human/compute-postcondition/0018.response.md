The provided Python code snippet is `input()`, which reads a new line of input from the user but does not store it in any variable. This means that the values of all existing variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where `m` must be greater than 3; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; the current lists `l11` and `l22` are not equal.**
