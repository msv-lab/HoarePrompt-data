The provided code snippet reads a line of input, converts it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a2` while the remaining integers are collected into the list `l2`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a1` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.**
