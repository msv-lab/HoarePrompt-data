Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where `m` must be greater than 2; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; the current lists `l11` and `l22` are not equal. The loop has executed `m - 2` times, reading `m - 2` additional lines of input but not storing them.`**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the state remains largely the same as the initial state with the additional condition that the loop has executed `m - 2` times, and during these executions, `m - 2` lines of input have been read but not stored. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged from their definitions in the initial state.
