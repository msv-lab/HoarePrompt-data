The code snippet `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes an input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`. Given this, the value of `a3` is the first integer from the input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` is updated based on conditions, `l22` is updated based on conditions, `idx1` is updated based on conditions, `idx2` is updated based on conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is updated based on conditions, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.**
