The `break` statement will exit the current loop or block of code. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the execution will break out of the most internal loop or block.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
