Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 5, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, and `i` is 4. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no changes are made to the variables. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to 4 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` are set to 4, and either `p1` or `p2` is set to 1. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
