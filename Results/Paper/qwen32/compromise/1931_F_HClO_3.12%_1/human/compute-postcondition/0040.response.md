Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0; otherwise, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1; in both cases, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`; `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` will break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.**
