Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The program sorts the array and then counts the occurrences of the median element, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

To increase the median, we need to increment elements in such a way that the median value increases. The median is the middle element in a sorted list. If the number of elements (n) is odd, the median is the element at index \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil - 1\). If n is even, the median is the element at index \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\), but the problem specifies that we should consider the element at index \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil - 1\) as the median for the purpose of this problem.

The correct approach involves sorting the array and then determining how many increments are required to make the median element larger than its current value. This involves selecting the smallest elements and incrementing them until the median condition is satisfied.

The current program does not perform any increments or consider the effect of increments on the median. It simply counts the occurrences of the median element, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
