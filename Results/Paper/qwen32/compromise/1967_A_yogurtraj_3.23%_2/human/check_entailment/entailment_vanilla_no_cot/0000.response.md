Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum score for each test case. The logic used to distribute the `k` additional cards and compute the score is flawed. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Cards**: The variable `rem` is intended to track the remainder of cards after distributing `k` cards evenly among the last `y` types of cards. However, it is not used correctly in the final score calculation.

2. **Incorrect Score Calculation**: The formula `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` is not correct for calculating the maximum score. The score should be based on how many complete permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` can be formed after distributing the cards optimally.

3. **Handling of Remaining Coins (`k`)**: If there are still coins left after the loop, they should be distributed among the card types to maximize the number of complete permutations.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of cards needed to form one permutation
        min_needed = sum(a[:n-1])
        
        # If we have enough cards already to form one permutation, start from there
        if min_needed >= n:
            r = min(a)
        else:
            r = 0
        
        # Distribute the remaining cards to maximize the number of complete permutations
        for i in range(n-1):
            diff = (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            if diff > k:
                r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
                k %= (i + 1)
                break
            else:
                k -= diff
                r = a[i + 1]
        
        if k != 0:
            r += k // n
        
        # Calculate the maximum score
        score = max(0, r - n + 1)
        print(score * (len(a) - n + 1))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the cards are distributed optimally to maximize the number of complete permutations and calculates the score accordingly.
