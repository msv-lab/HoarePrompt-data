Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by 1, `y` is `n - 6`, `rem` is `k % 6`, `i` is 5, `r` is `a[5] + k // 6`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
