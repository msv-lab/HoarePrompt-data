The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ii` and the input to the `range` function.

At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is incremented by `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ii` needs to be set to its value at the start of the current iteration plus 1 (since `ii` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration of the `for` loop).

Let's denote the value of `ii` at the start of the current iteration as `ii_start`. Since `ii` is incremented by `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we have:
\[ \text{ii\_start} = \text{ii} - (n - 1) \]

For the next iteration, `ii` should be:
\[ \text{ii} = \text{ii\_start} + 1 = (\text{ii} - (n - 1)) + 1 = \text{ii} - n + 2 \]

However, since we don't know the exact value of `ii` at the start of the current iteration, we can simply say that `ii` should be incremented by 1 from its current value to start the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by 1, `k` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `rem` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged**

Since the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the loop head only contains `ii`, we adjust only `ii`.

Final State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by 1**
