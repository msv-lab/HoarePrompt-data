To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is at least 4.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `ii` is incremented by `n - 1`.
- `k` is not 0.
- `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`.
- `y` is `n - 1 - i`.
- `k` is the reduced value after all iterations up to the point where the loop broke.

The specific values of `t`, `a`, `ii`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and the exact state of `k` after the loop are not explicitly provided. However, we need to focus on the expression inside the `print` statement: `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

Let's analyze the expression step-by-step:

1. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`:**
   - Substitute `r` into the expression: `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1`.
   - Simplify the expression: `(a[n - 1] - 1 + k // n) * n + 1`.
   - Distribute `n`: `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + (k // n) * n + 1`.
   - Combine like terms: `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + k + 1`.

Given the above steps, the final expression to be printed is `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + k + 1`.

Since the exact values of `a[n - 1]` and `k` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + k + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list `a` and `k` is the reduced value after all iterations up to the point where the loop broke)**
