The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. This means `r` now holds the next element in the sorted list `a` after the current index `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
