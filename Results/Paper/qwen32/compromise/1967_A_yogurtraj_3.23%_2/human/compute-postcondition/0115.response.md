The code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)` and assigns it to `rem`. Given that `i` is 5, the expression becomes `k % 6`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is `k % 6`, `i` is 5, `r` is `a[5] + k // 6`.**
