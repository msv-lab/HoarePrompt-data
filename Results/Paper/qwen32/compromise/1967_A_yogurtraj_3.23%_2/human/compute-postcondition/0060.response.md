Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ii` is incremented by 1. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is `a[i + 1]`. Additionally, if the else part is executed, then `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`.**
