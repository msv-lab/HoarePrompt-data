The given code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `ii`, or `r`. The only new variable introduced is `rem`.

Given the initial state, the output state will include the newly calculated `rem` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `ii` is incremented by 1, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**.
