Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by `n - 1`. `k` is not 0. `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where `i` is the iteration where the loop broke, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is the reduced value after all iterations up to the point where the loop broke.**
