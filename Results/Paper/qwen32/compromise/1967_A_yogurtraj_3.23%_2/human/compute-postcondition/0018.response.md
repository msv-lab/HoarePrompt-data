The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's say `i = x`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `x + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, `y`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which we are not concerned with here.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is `x + 1` where `x` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

For clarity, if we assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 4. However, without loss of generality, we can express it as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

To be specific and concrete, if we assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is 4**. 

But generally:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
