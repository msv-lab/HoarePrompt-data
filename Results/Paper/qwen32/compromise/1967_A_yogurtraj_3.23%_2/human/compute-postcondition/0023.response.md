Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `r` is assigned the value `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `k` is 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k` remain unchanged except for the fact that we execute a `break` statement, which causes us to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
