Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Initial Setup**: We have an array `a` of length `n` and an empty set `S`.
2. **Operation**:
   - We perform `n` operations where in each operation:
     - We choose an index `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ |a|).
     - We insert `a[i] + i` into `S`.
     - We delete `a[i]` from `a`.
3. **Set `S`**: Since `S` is a set, it doesn’t allow duplicate elements.
4. **Final Array `b`**: After all operations, we construct `b` by sorting the elements of `S` in decreasing order.
5. **Objective**: Find the lexicographically largest possible array `b`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`**:
   - It modifies the array `a` by adding the index `i+1` to each element `a[i]`. This is done in a loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(n):
         a[i] += i + 1
     ```
   - This transformation aligns with the problem statement where we need to insert `a[i] + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Counting Unique Elements**:
   - It then creates a `Counter` object to count the occurrences of each element in the modified `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts it in decreasing order.
     ```python
     counter = Counter(a)
     a = list(set(a))
     a.sort(reverse=True)
     ```
   - This step ensures that we are only working with unique elements and in the correct order.

4. **Constructing `ans`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the final result.
   - It iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a`.
   - For each element, it calculates `adv`, which is the number of additional elements to insert between the current element and the previous one.
     ```python
     adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
     ```
   - It appends these additional elements to `ans` and adjusts the counts accordingly.
   - It also appends the current element to `ans` and updates the counts.
     ```python
     ans.append(a[i])
     counter[a[i]] -= 1
     cur += counter[a[i]]
     ```

5. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - If there are any remaining elements to be added (`cnt` is not zero), it appends the last element of `ans` minus 1 repeatedly until `cnt` becomes zero.
     ```python
     for _ in range(cnt):
         ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
     ```

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the constructed `ans` array.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly modifies the array `a` by adding the index `i+1` to each element.
- It ensures that only unique elements are considered by converting `a` to a set.
- It sorts the unique elements in decreasing order.
- It calculates and inserts the additional elements correctly to maximize the lexicographical order.
- The final output is the lexicographically largest possible array `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
