Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1, `cur` is updated to `cur + counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv` if `i > 0`, `ans` is a list with `adv` elements, each equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1` if `i > 0`, and an additional element `a[i]` appended to it. If `i` is not greater than 0, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged except `ans` now includes `a[i]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `cur` is increased by the value of `counter[a[i]]`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description, except `cur` which is now the sum of its previous value and `counter[a[i]]`.
