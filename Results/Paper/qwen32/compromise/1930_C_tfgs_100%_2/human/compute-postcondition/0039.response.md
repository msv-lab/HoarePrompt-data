To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the provided loop and the given output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(adv):
    ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
```

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order.
   - `counter` is a Counter object with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1.
   - `cur` is updated to `cur + counter[a[i]]`.
   - `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv` if `i > 0`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - `ans` is a list with `adv` elements if `i > 0`, each equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1`, and an additional element `a[i]` appended to it. If `i` is not greater than 0, `ans` now includes `a[i]`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`.

2. **Output State after the loop executes 1 time:**
   - `adv` is a positive integer.
   - `ans` has a new element appended, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.

3. **Output State after the loop executes 2 times:**
   - `adv` is a positive integer.
   - `ans` has two new elements appended, which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`.
   - `j` is `j + 2`.

4. **Output State after the loop executes 3 times:**
   - `adv` is a positive integer.
   - `ans` has three new elements appended, which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`, and `a[i - 1] - j - 3`.
   - `j` is `j + 2`.

From these observations, it is clear that the loop will execute `adv` times, appending `adv` elements to the list `ans`. Each appended element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1`.

**Final Output State:**
- `adv` will be a positive integer.
- `ans` will have `adv` new elements appended, which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1`.
- `j` will range from 0 to `adv - 1`.
- Other variables like `a`, `counter`, `cur`, `cnt`, `i` remain unchanged except `ans` which is updated as described.

Output State: **`ans` has `adv` new elements appended, each calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged except `ans`.**
