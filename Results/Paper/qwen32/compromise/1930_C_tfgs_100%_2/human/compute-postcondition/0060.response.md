Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is unchanged, `j` is set to `adv`, `ans` has `adv` new elements appended to it and an additional element `a[i]`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, and `cur` is decreased by `adv`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `adv`, `j`, `ans`, `cnt`, or `cur`. `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1. `cur` is increased by `counter[a[i]]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `cur` is updated by adding the value of `counter[a[i]]` to it. All other conditions and variable states remain as described in the initial state, with the specific change being that `cur` now reflects the addition of `counter[a[i]]`.
