The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `j + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j + 2` must be less than `adv`, implying that `j` must be `j + 2` from the previous iteration.

State: **`adv` is a positive integer; `ans` has two new elements appended, which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`; `j` is `j + 2`**
