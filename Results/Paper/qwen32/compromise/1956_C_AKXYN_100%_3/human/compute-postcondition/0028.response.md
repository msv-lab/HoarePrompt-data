The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1, and `n` must remain greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1, `i` is 1**
