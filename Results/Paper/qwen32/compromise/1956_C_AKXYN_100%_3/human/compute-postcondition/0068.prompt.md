You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n x n matrix. It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        
        print(res, n << 1)
        
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where each iteration processes a matrix of size `n` (as specified by the input). For each test case, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`. The variable `res` is calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, which simplifies to the formula \(\frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}\). The variable `i` is 0 at the start of each iteration. The loop prints `res` followed by `n << 1` (which is `2 * n`), and then for each `i` from `n` down to 1, it prints two lines: the first line starting with '1' followed by `i` and the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line starting with '2' followed by `i` and the numbers from 1 to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n representing the size of an n x n matrix. The function returns the result of processing each test case, which is not specified in the given output details.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
