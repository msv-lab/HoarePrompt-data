The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from `n` and decrementing by 1 until `i` reaches 1 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to 0, but since the loop condition is `i` from `n` to 1 (inclusive) with a step of -1, the loop will terminate after `i` is 1.

However, if we consider the hypothetical scenario of adjusting `i` to allow another iteration, we would set `i` to 2, which would allow the loop to execute again with `i` being decremented to 1 in the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 2**
