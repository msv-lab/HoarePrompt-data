Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `res + 2 * (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 2`**

In natural language: The value of `res` is increased by `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, and `i` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
