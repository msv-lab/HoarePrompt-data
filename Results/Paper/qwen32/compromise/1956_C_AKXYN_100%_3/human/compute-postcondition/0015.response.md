The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n` down to 1 (inclusive) with a step of -1. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`
- `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and since the loop decrements `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would terminate because the next value of `i` would be 0, which is not greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end - 1`. For the loop to continue, `i_end` must be at least 2.

Since the value of `n` does not change and the loop decrements `i` by 1, we just need to adjust `i` to be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, provided that this value is still greater than 0.

Assuming `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 1**
