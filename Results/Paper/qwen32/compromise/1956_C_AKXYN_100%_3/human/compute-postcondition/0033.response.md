Let's break down the given information and calculate the values that will be printed.

1. **Variable `t`**: It is mentioned that `t` must be greater than 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

2. **Variable `n`**: It is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided. However, we know that it is used to define the structure of `mat` and to calculate `res`.

3. **Variable `mat`**: It is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`. For example, if `n` is 3, `mat` would be `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]`. However, `mat` is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

4. **Variable `res`**: It is calculated using the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\). This formula calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 3, then `res` would be \(\frac{3(3+1)(2*3+1)}{6} = \frac{3*4*7}{6} = 14\).

5. **Variable `i`**: It is set to `n-1`, but it is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

6. **Expression `n << 1`**: This is a bitwise left shift operation. Shifting `n` left by 1 bit is equivalent to multiplying `n` by 2. For example, if `n` is 3, then `n << 1` would be `3 * 2 = 6`.

Based on the above analysis, the `print` statement will output the value of `res` and the result of `n << 1`.

Output: **res (where res is \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\)), n << 1 (where n << 1 is n multiplied by 2)**
