Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is defined as \( n - 1 \).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is defined as \( n - 1 \).
   - Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be a positive integer.

2. **Formatted String:**
   - The expression `'2 %d' % i` creates a formatted string where `%d` is replaced by the value of `i`.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, then `i` is 4, and the formatted string will be `'2 4'`.

3. **Range Function:**
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

4. **Combining the Outputs:**
   - The `print` statement combines the formatted string and the sequence generated by `range`.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, the `print` statement will output `'2 4 1 2 3 4 5'`.

### General Output Description:
- The first part of the output is always `'2 '` followed by the value of `i`, which is \( n - 1 \).
- The second part of the output is the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

### Final Output:
Output: **'2 [n-1] 1 2 3 ... [n]' (where [n-1] is the value of n-1 and [n] is the value of n)**

### Example for Clarity:
If `n` is 5:
- `i` will be 4.
- The output will be `'2 4 1 2 3 4 5'`.

Output: **'2 4 1 2 3 4 5'** (for `n = 5`)

### Generalized Output:
Output: **'2 [n-1] 1 2 3 ... [n]' (where [n-1] is the value of n-1 and [n] is the value of n)**
