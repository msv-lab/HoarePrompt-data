The code snippet creates a new list `mat` which is a matrix of size `n x n` where each row is a list of integers from 1 to `n`. The variables `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` remains unchanged, and `i` is 0.**

In simpler terms, `mat` becomes a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns, filled with numbers from 1 to `n` in each row. The values of `n`, `res`, and `i` stay the same.
