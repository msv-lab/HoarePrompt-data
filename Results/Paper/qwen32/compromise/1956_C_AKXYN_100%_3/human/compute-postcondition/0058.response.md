Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step:

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is \( n - 1 \).

Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is defined as \( n - 1 \), the value of `i` will be one less than `n`.

2. **String Formatting:**
   - The expression `'2 %d' % i` is a string formatting operation where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. This will be replaced by the value of `i`.
   - Therefore, `'2 %d' % i` will result in a string like `'2 n-1'` (where `n-1` is the actual value of `i`).

3. **Range Function:**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

4. **Unpacking with `*`:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)` and passes each element as a separate argument to the `print` function.
   - This means that all the numbers from 1 to `n` will be printed after the formatted string.

### Putting It All Together:
- The `print` statement first prints the formatted string `'2 %d' % i` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Example:
If `n` is 5, then:
- `i` will be \( 5 - 1 = 4 \).
- The formatted string will be `'2 4'`.
- The sequence generated by `range(1, 5 + 1)` will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- The final output will be: `2 4 1 2 3 4 5`.

### General Output:
For any `n` greater than 0:
- The formatted string will be `'2 n-1'`.
- The sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)` will be the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **2 n-1 1 2 ... n (where n-1 is the value of i and the sequence 1 2 ... n are the numbers from 1 to n)**
