Let's analyze the provided program and the execution summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using no more than `2 * n` operations. The operations allowed are:
1. Type 1: Choose a row `i` and a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to `n`. Assign `a_{i, j} = p_j` for all `j`.
2. Type 2: Choose a column `j` and a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to `n`. Assign `a_{i, j} = p_i` for all `i`.

The optimal strategy is to fill the matrix in such a way that each row and each column contains all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once. This way, the sum of each row and each column will be the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). Since there are `n` rows and `n` columns, the total sum will be \(n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}\).

### Program Analysis:
The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix using the formula \(\frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}\). However, this formula does not match the expected maximum sum \(\frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}\). Instead, it seems to be calculating a different quantity, possibly the sum of the first `n` triangular numbers, which is not directly related to the problem.

The operations printed by the program are:
- For each row `i` from `n` to 1, it performs a Type 1 operation setting the row to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- For each row `i` from `n` to 1, it performs a Type 2 operation setting the column to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

This sequence of operations will not necessarily fill the matrix with all integers from 1 to `n` in each row and column, and it does not guarantee that the sum of the matrix will be maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum, and the operations it performs do not guarantee that the sum of the matrix is maximized. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
