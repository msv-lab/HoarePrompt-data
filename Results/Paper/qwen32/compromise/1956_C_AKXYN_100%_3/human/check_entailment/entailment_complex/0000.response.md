### Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an `n x n` matrix by performing a series of operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of numbers from 1 to `n`. The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum with no more than `2n` operations.

#### Analysis of the Output Formula:

The program calculates the maximum sum as:
\[ \text{res} = \frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6} \]

To understand if this formula is correct, let's derive the maximum possible sum manually:

- For each row `i` (1 to `n`), the maximum sum of elements in that row can be obtained by filling it with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is:
  \[ \text{Sum of row} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

- Since there are `n` rows, the total sum of all elements in the matrix, if each row is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, is:
  \[ \text{Total sum} = n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \]

However, the formula used in the program is:
\[ \text{res} = \frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6} \]

Let's simplify and compare this formula with the expected total sum:

- The formula can be expanded as:
  \[ \text{res} = \frac{4n^3 + 3n^2 - n}{6} \]

- This does not match the expected total sum of \(\frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2}\).

#### Analysis of the Operations:

The program performs `2n` operations:
- For each `i` from `n` down to 1, it performs two operations:
  - A Type 1 operation on row `i` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
  - A Type 2 operation on column `i` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

These operations ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, achieving the maximum possible sum for each row and column.

### Conclusion:

The formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect. The correct formula should be \(\frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2}\). However, the operations performed by the program are correct and will indeed maximize the sum of the matrix.

Since the output formula is incorrect, the program does not provide the correct maximum sum, even though the operations are correct.
