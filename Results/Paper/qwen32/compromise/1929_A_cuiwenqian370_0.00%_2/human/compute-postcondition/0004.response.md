To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `left <= right` is satisfied right before the loop starts. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
- `new_arr` is an empty list.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is `n - 1`.

The condition `left <= right` must be true for the loop to execute. Initially, `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `right` will be at least 1, making `left` (0) always less than or equal to `right` (1 or more).

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to the initial state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`**
