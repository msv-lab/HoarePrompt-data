The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, and the precondition constraints on `arr` remain unchanged, except for the order of elements within `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
