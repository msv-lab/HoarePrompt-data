The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `tmp`. The variables `t`, `bx`, and `ax` are not affected by this assignment. The precondition that `bx` is less than or equal to `ax` remains valid.

Output State: **`t`, `bx`, and `ax` are as described in the precondition; `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`; `tmp` is `0`.**
