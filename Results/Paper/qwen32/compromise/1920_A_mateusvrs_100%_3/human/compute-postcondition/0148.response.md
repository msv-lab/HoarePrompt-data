The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of constraints, followed by `n` lines of constraints. Each constraint is defined by two integers `a` (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}) and `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). If `a=1`, the value `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`. If `a=2`, the value `k` must be less than or equal to `x`. If `a=3`, the value `k` must not be equal to `x`. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.

The function returns:
- Case_1: If there is no integer `k` that satisfies all the constraints for a test case, the function returns "No solution".
- Case_2: If there is at least one integer `k` that satisfies all the constraints for a test case, the function returns "Solution exists".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and `n` constraints. It returns "Solution exists" if there is at least one integer `k` that satisfies all constraints for the test case, and "No solution" if no such integer exists.**
