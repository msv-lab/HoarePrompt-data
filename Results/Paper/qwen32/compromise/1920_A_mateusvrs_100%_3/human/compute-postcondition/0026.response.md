The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `x`. The initial state specifies conditions on `t`, `r`, `n`, and the conditional assignments for `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` based on the value of `a`. After the code execution, `a` and `x` will have the values read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `bx`, `ax`, `cx`) remain unchanged unless `a` is 1 or 2, in which case `bx` or `ax` will be conditionally assigned.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
