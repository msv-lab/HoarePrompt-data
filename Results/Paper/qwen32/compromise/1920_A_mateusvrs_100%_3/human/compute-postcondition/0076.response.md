The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `ax` was initially set to 1000000007. After the execution of the code, `ax` will be the smaller value between `x` and 1000000007.

Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input.**
