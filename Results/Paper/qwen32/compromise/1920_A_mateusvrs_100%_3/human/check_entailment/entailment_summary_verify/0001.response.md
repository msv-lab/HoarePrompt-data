Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Constraints Types**:
   - Type 1: \( k \geq x \)
   - Type 2: \( k \leq x \)
   - Type 3: \( k \neq x \)

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `cx`: A set to store values that \( k \) cannot be (from constraints of type 3).
   - `ax`: Initialized to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`), representing the initial maximum possible value for \( k \).
   - `bx`: Initialized to a small value (`-1`), representing the initial minimum possible value for \( k \).

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint:
     - If it's of type 1, update `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and the given \( x \).
     - If it's of type 2, update `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the given \( x \).
     - If it's of type 3, add \( x \) to the set `cx`.

3. **Counting Valid \( k \) Values**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means no valid \( k \) exists, so append `0` to the results.
   - Otherwise, count how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtract this count from the total possible integers in the range (`ax - bx + 1`).

4. **Output**:
   - Print the results for all test cases.

### Verification:
- **Constraints of Type 1 and 2**: The program correctly sets `bx` to the maximum value of \( x \) from type 1 constraints and `ax` to the minimum value of \( x \) from type 2 constraints. This ensures that only \( k \) values within the range `[bx, ax]` are considered.
- **Constraints of Type 3**: The program correctly identifies values that \( k \) cannot be and excludes them from the valid range.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `bx > ax`, it correctly returns `0` because no \( k \) can satisfy both \( k \geq \text{some value} \) and \( k \leq \text{some smaller value} \).
  - If there are no invalid values in `cx` within the range `[bx, ax]`, the count is simply `ax - bx + 1`.

### Function Summary:
The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program. It processes constraints to determine the valid range for \( k \) and excludes values that \( k \) cannot be.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all constraints appropriately and correctly calculates the number of valid \( k \) values.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
