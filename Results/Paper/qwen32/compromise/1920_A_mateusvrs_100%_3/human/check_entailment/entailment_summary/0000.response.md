### Reasoning:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints for each test case. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `ax` to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`) and `bx` to a very small number (`-1`). These will hold the maximum lower bound (`bx`) and the minimum upper bound (`ax`) respectively.
   - A set `cx` is used to store the values that `k` must not be equal to.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the program updates `bx` and `ax` based on the type of constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.
   - This ensures that `bx` will be the highest lower bound and `ax` will be the lowest upper bound across all constraints of type 1 and 2 respectively.

3. **Checking Validity**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx > ax`. If this condition is true, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds simultaneously, so it appends `0` to the result list.
   - If `bx <= ax`, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx` (i.e., the integers that `k` cannot be equal to).

4. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - The number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` is `ax - bx + 1`.
   - The program then subtracts the count of integers in `cx` that fall within this range from the total count to get the final number of valid integers for that test case.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case as per the problem description. It also correctly handles cases where no valid `k` exists by checking if `bx > ax`.

**Correctness: True**
