Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Constraints Types**:
   - Type 1: k ≥ x
   - Type 2: k ≤ x
   - Type 3: k ≠ x

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints.

3. **Approach**:
   - For each test case, read the number of constraints `n`.
   - Process each constraint to determine the minimum (`bx`) and maximum (`ax`) possible values for `k` based on constraints of type 1 and 2.
   - Collect all values that `k` cannot be (`cx`) from constraints of type 3.
   - Calculate the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of invalid integers `k` (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total possible integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `cx`: A set to store values that `k` cannot be (from constraints of type 3).
   - `ax`: Initialized to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`), representing the initial maximum possible value for `k`.
   - `bx`: Initialized to a small value (`-1`), representing the initial minimum possible value for `k`.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint:
     - If it's of type 1, update `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and the given `x`.
     - If it's of type 2, update `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the given `x`.
     - If it's of type 3, add `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Counting Valid `k` Values**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means no valid `k` exists, so append `0` to the results.
   - Otherwise, count how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtract this count from the total possible integers in the range (`ax - bx + 1`).

4. **Output**:
   - Print the results for all test cases.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid `k` values.
- It ensures that the constraints of type 1 and 2 are respected by setting `bx` and `ax` accordingly.
- It correctly identifies and excludes values from `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
