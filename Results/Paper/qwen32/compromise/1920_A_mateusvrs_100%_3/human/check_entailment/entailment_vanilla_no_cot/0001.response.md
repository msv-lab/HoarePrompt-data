Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Types of Constraints:**
   - Type 1: `k >= x`
   - Type 2: `k <= x`
   - Type 3: `k != x`

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints.

3. **Constraints:**
   - There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2.
   - No two constraints are identical.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - `r`: List to store the results for each test case.
   - `cx`: Set to store values of `x` for constraints of type 3.
   - `ax`: Maximum possible value for `k` (initially set to a large number).
   - `bx`: Minimum possible value for `k` (initially set to a small number).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Read the number of constraints `n`.
   - For each constraint:
     - If type 1 (`a == 1`), update `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
     - If type 2 (`a == 2`), update `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
     - If type 3 (`a == 3`), add `x` to the set `cx`.
   - After processing all constraints:
     - If `bx > ax`, it means there are no integers `k` that can satisfy both type 1 and type 2 constraints simultaneously, so append `0` to `r`.
     - Otherwise, count the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx` and append this count to `r`.

3. **Output:**
   - Print the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Verification

- **Handling Type 1 and Type 2 Constraints:**
  - The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum possible values for `k` based on type 1 and type 2 constraints.
  
- **Handling Type 3 Constraints:**
  - The program correctly excludes values of `k` that are explicitly forbidden by type 3 constraints.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where no valid `k` exists (i.e., `bx > ax`) by returning `0`.
  - It also handles cases where the range of valid `k` is small or large, including when all values in the range are forbidden by type 3 constraints.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program processes each test case in linear time relative to the number of constraints, which is efficient given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all constraints appropriately and efficiently computes the number of valid integers `k` for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
