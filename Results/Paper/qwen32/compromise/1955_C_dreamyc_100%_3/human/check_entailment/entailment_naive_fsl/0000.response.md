Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern and does not accurately determine the number of ships sunk. Let's analyze why:

The function `func_1` attempts to determine the number of ships sunk by calculating the cumulative durability from both ends (start and end) and comparing it to half of the total attacks `k`. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the alternating attack pattern of the Kraken and does not account for the fact that once a ship sinks, it is no longer attacked.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Correctness:**
1. Attack 1: Kraken attacks the first ship (durability becomes 0), ships = [2, 1].
2. Attack 2: Kraken attacks the last ship (durability becomes 0), ships = [2].
3. Attack 3: Kraken attacks the first ship (durability becomes 1), ships = [1].
4. Attack 4: Kraken attacks the last ship (durability becomes 0), ships = [].
5. Attack 5: No ships left to attack.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program might output `3` because it incorrectly calculates the cumulative durability and does not properly account for the alternating pattern of attacks and sinking ships.

To correctly simulate the Kraken's attack, the program should iteratively attack the first and last ships, decrement their durability, and remove them from consideration once they sink. This requires a more detailed simulation rather than the current approach of summing cumulative durability and comparing to `k`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums = deque(nums)
    sunk = 0
    
    while k > 0 and nums:
        # Attack the first ship
        if nums[0] > 0:
            nums[0] -= 1
            if nums[0] == 0:
                nums.popleft()
                sunk += 1
        k -= 1
        
        if k > 0 and nums:
            # Attack the last ship
            if nums[-1] > 0:
                nums[-1] -= 1
                if nums[-1] == 0:
                    nums.pop()
                    sunk += 1
            k -= 1
    
    print(sunk)
```

This corrected version uses a deque to efficiently remove ships from both ends and correctly simulates the Kraken's attack pattern.
