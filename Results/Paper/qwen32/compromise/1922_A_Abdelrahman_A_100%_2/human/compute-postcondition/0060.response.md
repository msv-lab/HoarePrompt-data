To determine the output of the given print statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `c` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `tests` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `slength` is the input integer.
- `counter` is 2.
- `i` is the value from the previous iteration plus 1.
- `x` is `c[i]`.
- The condition checks if `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`. If this condition is met, `no` is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop continues.
- `no` is False.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('YES')` does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement will always be `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `tests`, `slength`, `counter`, `i`, `x`, or the value of `no`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
