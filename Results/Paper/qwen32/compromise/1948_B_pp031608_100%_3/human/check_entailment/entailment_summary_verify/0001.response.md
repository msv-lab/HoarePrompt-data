Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Problem Recap

We need to determine if an array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits.

### Program Analysis

Here is the provided program again for reference:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Function Summary

The function summary suggests that the function processes multiple test cases, checks if the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence by potentially merging adjacent elements, and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Issues in the Program

The primary issue with the program lies in its approach to determining if the array can be sorted:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
   - The program only checks if the immediate sublist (digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`) can be sorted when `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`.
   - This approach does not account for the broader implications of splitting elements and how it affects the rest of the array.
   
2. **Lack of Comprehensive Checking:**
   - After splitting `arr[i-1]`, the program sets `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number and continues checking the next pair.
   - This does not ensure that the entire array can be sorted after these operations.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue

Consider the test case:

```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

- **First Test Case:** `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
  - The program correctly identifies that the array can be sorted by splitting `12` into `[1, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`.

- **Second Test Case:** `[12, 28, 5]`
  - When it reaches `i=2`, it finds `arr[2] < arr[1]` (5 < 28).
  - It splits `arr[1]` into `[2, 8]` and checks if `[2, 8, 5]` can be sorted, which it can.
  - However, this does not guarantee that the entire array can be sorted. The correct approach would involve more complex checks to ensure that all elements can be rearranged to form a sorted array.

- **Third Test Case:** `[0, 0]`
  - The array is already sorted, so the program correctly outputs "YES".

### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve a more comprehensive method to check if the array can be sorted by considering all possible splits and ensuring that the entire array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the program's logic, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
