The given code snippet creates a new list `nums` by taking the digits of the integer at index `i-1` from the list `a` and appending the integer at index `i` from the same list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99
- `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2
- `i` is 2

The code executes as follows:
- `nums` is assigned a new list which consists of the digits of `a[i-1]` (which is `a[1]` since `i` is 2) and the integer `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`).

Let's denote the value of `a[1]` as `a1` and the value of `a[2]` as `a2`. The digits of `a1` are extracted and converted to integers, and then `a2` is appended to this list.

Thus, the output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` remains the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50)
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99
- `m` remains an input integer that must be at least 2
- `i` remains 2
- `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `a[1]` followed by `a[2]`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `a[1]` followed by `a[2]`.**
