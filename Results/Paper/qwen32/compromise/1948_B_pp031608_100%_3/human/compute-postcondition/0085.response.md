Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 2. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `a[1]` followed by `a[2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. `arr[1]` is set to `nums[0]`. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
