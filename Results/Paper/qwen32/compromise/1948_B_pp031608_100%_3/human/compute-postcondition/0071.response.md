Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list where `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, and `ans` is either True or False based on the sorting condition. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `arr` remains unchanged and `nums` is not defined.**
