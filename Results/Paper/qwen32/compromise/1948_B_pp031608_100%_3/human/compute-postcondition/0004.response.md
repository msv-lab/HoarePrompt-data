Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` has been set to `True`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`) retain their initial values as they have not been modified by the given code snippet.
