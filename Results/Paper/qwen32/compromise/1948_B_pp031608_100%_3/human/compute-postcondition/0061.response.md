The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `arr`. This means that the list `arr` will now contain the integers from the input.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Only `arr` is modified to reflect the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is either True or False based on whether any `nums` was found to be unsorted.**
