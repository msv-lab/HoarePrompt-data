The code snippet provided modifies the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. This change impacts the `arr` list specifically at the index `i - 1`.

Given the initial state, the following variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
- `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.
- `ans` is a boolean that remains True unless `nums` is not sorted, in which case it is set to False and the loop is broken.

The only change is that `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `ans` is a boolean that remains True unless `nums` is not sorted, in which case it is set to False and the loop is broken.**
