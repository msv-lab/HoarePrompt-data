To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the existing variables:

Given Code:
```python
nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
```

This line of code does the following:
- Converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` to a string.
- Iterates over each character in the string representation of `arr[i - 1]`.
- Converts each character back to an integer and collects these integers into a list.
- Appends the integer `arr[i]` to the end of this list.

Let's break down the changes:
- `nums` is newly created and populated with the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.

Variables that remain unchanged:
- `t` (integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3)
- `n` (input integer 2 ≤ n ≤ 50)
- `a` (list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99)
- `m` (at least 2)
- `arr` (list of integers obtained from the input)
- `i` (incremented by 1, but its new value is not used in this snippet)

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
