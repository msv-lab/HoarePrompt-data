Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is either True or False based on whether the condition in the loop was violated**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated to the integer value of the input. All other variables remain unchanged.
