Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, `nums`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
