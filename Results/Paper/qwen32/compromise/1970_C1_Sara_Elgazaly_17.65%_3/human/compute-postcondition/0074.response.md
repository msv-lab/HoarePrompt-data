The code snippet `s = not s` inverts the boolean value of `s`. Therefore, if `s` was `False`, it becomes `True`, and if `s` was `True`, it becomes `False`. The values of the other variables (`x`, `y`, and `lst[x]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is a leaf node, `y` is the last node that was popped from `lst[x]` in the last iteration, `lst[x]` is an empty list, and `s` is `True` if the number of iterations is odd, and `False` if the number of iterations is even.**
