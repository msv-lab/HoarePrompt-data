Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is a leaf node, `y` is the last node visited before `x` became a leaf, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where the path from the starting node to the leaf node has all intermediate nodes' adjacency lists reduced, and `s` is False, `lst[x]` must be a non-empty list
Code of the loop:
while lst[x]:
    y = lst[x].pop()
    if lst[y] != []:
        x = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is a leaf node, `y` is the last node visited before `x` became a leaf, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where the path from the starting node to the leaf node has all intermediate nodes' adjacency lists reduced (and `lst[x]` has one less element), `s` is False. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is a leaf node, `y` is the last node visited before `x` became a leaf, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where the path from the starting node to the leaf node has all intermediate nodes' adjacency lists reduced (and `lst[x]` has one less element), `s` is False. If `lst[y]` is not empty, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is a node, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[x]` has one less element than before, and `s` is False. If `lst[y]` is not empty, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
