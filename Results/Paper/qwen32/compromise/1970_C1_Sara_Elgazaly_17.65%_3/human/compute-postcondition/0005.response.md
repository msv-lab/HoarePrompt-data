The given Python code snippet modifies the `defaultdict` `lst` by appending `a` to the list associated with the key `b`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2, `y` is assigned the value of the other integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` containing `b` and `lst[b]` containing `a`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000, `t` is 1, the tree structure with `n-1` edges and exactly two leaves remains the same, the starting node for each round is still `u_1`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `y` holds the value of the second integer read from the input, and `lst` now has `a` added to its list of values for the key `b` and `b` added to its list of values for the key `a`.
