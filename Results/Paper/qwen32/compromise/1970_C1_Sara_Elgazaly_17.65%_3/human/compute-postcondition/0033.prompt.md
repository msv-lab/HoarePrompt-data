Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2, `y` is assigned the value of the other integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where each key (node) has a list of its adjacent nodes representing the entire tree structure, `s` is True
Code of the loop:
while lst[x]:
    y = lst[x].pop()
    if lst[y] != []:
        x = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2 and x is not a leaf, `y` is the last adjacent node of `x` in the tree structure, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where each key (node) has a list of its adjacent nodes representing the entire tree structure excluding the node assigned to `y` for the key `x`, `s` is True. If the list of adjacent nodes for `y` in `lst` is not empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the variables.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is 1; the tree is represented by n-1 edges and has exactly two leaves; the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round; `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2 and x is not a leaf; `y` is the last adjacent node of `x` in the tree structure, which was the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where each key (node) has a list of its adjacent nodes representing the entire tree structure excluding the node assigned to `y` for the key `x` and `lst[x]` has one less element than before; `s` is True. If `lst[y]` is not empty, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no else part to execute.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is 1; the tree is represented by n-1 edges and has exactly two leaves; the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round; `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2 and x is not a leaf; `y` is the last adjacent node of `x` in the tree structure that was removed from `lst[x]`; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where each key (node) has a list of its adjacent nodes representing the entire tree structure excluding the node assigned to `y` for the key `x` and `lst[x]` now has one less element; `s` is True. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` becomes the value of `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
