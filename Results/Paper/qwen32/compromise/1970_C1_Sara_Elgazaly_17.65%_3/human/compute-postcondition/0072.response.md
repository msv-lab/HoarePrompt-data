Output State: **`x` is the last element of `lst[x]` that was popped in the last iteration, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` that was popped in the last iteration, `lst[x]` is an empty list, and `s` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been toggled from `True` to `False` due to the `s = not s` operation. All other variables retain their initial values.
