The code snippet `coord = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `coord`. This means that the previous sorted list with 8 elements is replaced by an empty list. The other variables (`n`, `res`, `p1`, `p2`) are not affected by this assignment.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

In natural language: `n` remains a non-zero value, `coord` is now an empty list, and `res`, `p1`, and `p2` retain their previous definitions but are based on the now-empty `coord` list, which means they are undefined or invalid in this context.
