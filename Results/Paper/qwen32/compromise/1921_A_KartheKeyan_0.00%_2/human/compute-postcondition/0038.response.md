Let's break down the given information and determine the output step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be a non-zero value.
- `coord` is a sorted list with 8 elements.
- `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`.
- `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
- `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.

### Analysis:
1. **`coord`**: This is a sorted list with 8 elements. Each element in the list is presumably a coordinate, likely in the form of a tuple (e.g., `(x, y)`).
2. **`p1`**: This is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first elements in the `coord` list.
   \[
   p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])
   \]
3. **`p2`**: This is the difference between the x-coordinates of the fourth and third elements in the `coord` list.
   \[
   p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])
   \]
4. **`res`**: This is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   \[
   res = abs(\sqrt{p1} \times \sqrt{p2})
   \]

### Calculation:
Since the exact values of `coord` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

### Output:
The `print(res)` statement will print the calculated value of `res`, which is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the differences between specific x-coordinates in the `coord` list.

Output: **res (where res is abs(math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])))**
