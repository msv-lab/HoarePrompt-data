The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `x` and `y`. The input is expected to be two integers separated by a space. The values of `n`, `coord`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input**.
