Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and we need to calculate its area.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of the square.

2. **Coordinate Storage and Sorting**:
    - The coordinates are stored in a list called `coord`.
    - The list is then sorted. Sorting helps in identifying the adjacent corners of the square.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
    - It calculates the squared distance between the first two sorted coordinates and the last two sorted coordinates.
    - These distances represent the squared lengths of two adjacent sides of the square.
    - The program then calculates the square root of these distances to get the side lengths.

4. **Area Calculation**:
    - The area of the square is calculated as the product of these side lengths.
    - The program prints the area for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Sorting and Distance Calculation**:
    - Sorting the coordinates does not guarantee that the adjacent corners are correctly identified for distance calculation.
    - The program assumes that the first two sorted coordinates and the last two sorted coordinates represent adjacent sides, which is not always true.
    - For example, if the coordinates are (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2), sorting them might not yield the correct pairs of adjacent corners.

- **Incorrect Area Calculation**:
    - The program calculates the area by multiplying the square roots of the distances, which is correct in terms of logic. However, the incorrect identification of adjacent corners leads to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
- Identify the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
- The side length of the square will be the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, as they should be the same).
- Calculate the area as the square of the side length.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly identify the adjacent corners of the square and therefore calculates the area incorrectly.

**Correctness: False**
