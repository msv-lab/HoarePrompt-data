Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires us to determine the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a binary string `s`, calculates the minimum cost to sort it, and prints the result.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases `t`, and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### `func_1()` Logic
- Initialize `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
- Iterate through the string `s`:
  - If the current character is '1', increment `n`.
  - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not 0, add `n + 1` to `ans`.
- Print `ans`.

#### Correctness Analysis
The provided program seems to be based on a specific observation:
- When encountering a '0' after some '1's, the cost to move those '1's to the right of the '0' is the number of '1's encountered so far plus one (to account for the cyclic shift).

Let's verify this logic with the example cases:

1. **Input: "10"**
   - `n` starts as 0.
   - First character is '1', so `n` becomes 1.
   - Second character is '0', so `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

2. **Input: "0000"**
   - `n` remains 0 throughout.
   - No '1's encountered, so `ans` remains 0.
   - Output: 0 (Correct)

3. **Input: "11000"**
   - `n` becomes 2 after the first two '1's.
   - First '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Second '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`.
   - Third '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `6 + 3 + 1 = 10`.
   - Output: 10 (Incorrect, Expected: 9)

4. **Input: "101011"**
   - `n` becomes 1 after the first '1'.
   - First '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Second '1' encountered, so `n` becomes 2.
   - Second '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - Third '1' encountered, so `n` becomes 3.
   - Fourth '1' encountered, so `n` becomes 4.
   - Output: 5 (Incorrect, Expected: 11)

5. **Input: "01101001"**
   - `n` becomes 1 after the first '1'.
   - First '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Second '1' encountered, so `n` becomes 2.
   - Second '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - Third '1' encountered, so `n` becomes 3.
   - Third '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `5 + 3 + 1 = 9`.
   - Fourth '1' encountered, so `n` becomes 4.
   - Fifth '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `9 + 4 + 1 = 14`.
   - Sixth '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `14 + 5 + 1 = 20`.
   - Output: 20 (Incorrect, Expected: 11)

From the above analysis, it is clear that the program does not produce the correct output for several test cases. The logic in `func_1()` does not correctly account for the minimum cost to sort the string in all cases.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect as it does not handle all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
