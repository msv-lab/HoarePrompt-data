### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided solution with a focus on the logic used in `func_1()` and compare it to the problem requirements.

#### Key Logic in `func_1()`
- The function iterates through the string `s`.
- It maintains a counter `n` that counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
- Whenever a '0' is encountered and `n` (the count of '1's seen so far) is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to the answer `ans`.

The logic of adding `n + 1` when encountering a '0' after `n` '1's is intended to account for the cost of moving that '0' past all the preceding '1's. However, this logic seems flawed based on the examples provided.

#### Example Walkthrough
Let's revisit the examples to see if the logic holds:

1. **Input:** `10`
   - `n = 1` (first character is '1')
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (second character is '0', and `n` is not zero)
   - Output: `2` (correct)

2. **Input:** `0000`
   - No '1's are encountered, so `ans` remains `0`.
   - Output: `0` (correct)

3. **Input:** `11000`
   - `n = 2` (first two characters are '1's)
   - `ans = 2 + 1 = 3` (third character is '0')
   - `ans = 3 + 2 = 5` (fourth character is '0')
   - `ans = 5 + 3 = 8` (fifth character is '0')
   - Output: `8` (incorrect, expected: `9`)

   The expected cost to sort `11000` to `00011` is indeed `9`, as shown in the problem statement. The provided solution seems to be off by one.

4. **Input:** `101011`
   - `n = 1` (first character is '1')
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (second character is '0')
   - `n = 2` (third character is '1')
   - `ans = 2 + 2 = 4` (fourth character is '0')
   - `n = 3` (fifth character is '1')
   - `ans = 4 + 3 = 7` (sixth character is '1')
   - Output: `7` (incorrect, expected: `5`)

5. **Input:** `01101001`
   - `n = 1` (second character is '1')
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (third character is '1')
   - `n = 2` (fourth character is '0')
   - `ans = 2 + 2 = 4` (fifth character is '1')
   - `n = 3` (sixth character is '0')
   - `ans = 4 + 3 = 7` (seventh character is '0')
   - `ans = 7 + 4 = 11` (eighth character is '1')
   - Output: `11` (correct)

### Analysis of `func_1()`
The logic in `func_1()` seems to be incorrect because it overestimates the cost for some cases. Specifically, the cost calculation `n + 1` for each '0' seems to be incorrect, as it does not accurately reflect the minimum cost required to sort the string.

### Conclusion
After a detailed analysis, it is clear that the provided solution is incorrect for some test cases. The logic for calculating the cost needs to be re-evaluated to ensure it correctly computes the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.

### Final Answer
Reasoning: The provided solution has incorrect logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
Final: **False**
