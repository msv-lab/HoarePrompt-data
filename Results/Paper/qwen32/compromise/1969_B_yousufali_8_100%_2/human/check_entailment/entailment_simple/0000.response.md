### Reasoning:
The provided code is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on its substrings. However, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost as described in the problem statement.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Logic Analysis**:
    - The function `func_1` iterates over the binary string `s`.
    - It increments `n` for each '1' encountered.
    - When it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
    - The logic does not account for the cost of cyclic shifts correctly. Specifically, it does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to minimize the total cost.

2. **Correct Approach**:
    - To sort the string in non-descending order, all '0's should be moved to the beginning, and all '1's should be moved to the end.
    - The cost of moving a '0' to the front (or a '1' to the end) depends on the position of the '0' (or '1') in the string.
    - The optimal strategy involves calculating the cost of each necessary shift and summing them up.

3. **Example**:
    - For the string "101011", the correct minimum cost is 5. However, the provided code does not compute this correctly. Instead, it might compute a different value based on its flawed logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the algorithm to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
