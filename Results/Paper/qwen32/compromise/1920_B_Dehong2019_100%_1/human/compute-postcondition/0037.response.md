Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus `a[i] * 2`, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` observed during the iterations**

Natural language: The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
