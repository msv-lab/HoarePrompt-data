The code calculates the sum of the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `ans1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a`.**
