The code snippet `ans2 = ans1` assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`. Therefore, `ans2` will now hold the same value as `ans1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **t remains the same; n is the first input integer; k is the second input integer; x is the third input integer; a is a sorted list in descending order; ans1 is the sum of all elements in the list a minus the sum of the first x elements of a multiplied by 2; ans2 is the sum of all elements in the list a minus the sum of the first x elements of a multiplied by 2.**
