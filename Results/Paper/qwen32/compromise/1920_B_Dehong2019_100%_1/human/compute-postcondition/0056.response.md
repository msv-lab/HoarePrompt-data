The code `ans1 += a[i]` adds the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the variable `ans1`. Given that `a` is a sorted list in descending order and `i` is incremented by 1, the value of `ans1` will be increased by the value at the new index `i`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`.**
