Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` multiplied by 2 plus `a[i]`, `ans2` is the same as `ans1` before the increment, and `i + x` is less than `n`**
