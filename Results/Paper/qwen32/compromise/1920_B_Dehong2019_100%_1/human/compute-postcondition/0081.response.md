The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` adds the value at index `i` of the array `a` to the variable `ans1`. Given the initial state that `i` is `i_end + 1`, the value of `ans1` will be updated by adding `a[i_end + 1]` to it. The other variables `k` and `i_end` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[i_end + 1]`**.
