The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. This changes the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` based on the input, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `ans1`, `ans2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same; `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `x` is the third input integer; `a` remains the same; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements plus the sum of the first `k` elements minus twice the sum of the elements from position `x` to `x + k - 1` (if these positions are within the bounds of the list); `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` observed during the iterations.**
