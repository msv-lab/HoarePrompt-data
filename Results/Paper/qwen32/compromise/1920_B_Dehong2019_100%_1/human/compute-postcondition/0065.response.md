The code snippet `ans1 = sum(a)` calculates the sum of all the elements in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `ans1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `ans2`) remain unchanged except for `ans1` which is now the sum of the elements in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is a sorted list in descending order of the integers from the latest input, `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` observed during the loop's execution.**
