The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i + x` in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and the original value of `ans1` remain unchanged except for `ans1` itself.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans1` is `ans1 + a[i] - a[i + x] * 2`, `ans2` is calculated as per the given conditions.**
