The code snippet `ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)` updates the value of `ans2` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `ans1`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is a sorted list in descending order. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` multiplied by 2 plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged. `ans2` is the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`.**
