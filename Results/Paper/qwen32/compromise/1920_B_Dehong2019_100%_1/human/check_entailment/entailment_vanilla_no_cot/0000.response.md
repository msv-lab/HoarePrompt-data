Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Alice's Optimal Strategy**: Alice should remove the k largest elements to maximize the sum. This is correctly handled by sorting the array in descending order and removing the first k elements.

2. **Bob's Optimal Strategy**: After Alice's move, Bob should flip the x smallest elements to minimize the sum. However, the program does not correctly implement this. It incorrectly assumes that flipping the first x elements after Alice's move is optimal, which is not necessarily true.

3. **Handling the Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum after Alice's move and then attempts to adjust it based on Bob's flips, but it does so in a way that does not account for the optimal choice of elements to flip.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice removes k largest elements
        a.sort()
        remaining = a[:n-k]
        
        # Bob flips x smallest elements among the remaining ones
        remaining.sort()
        for i in range(min(x, len(remaining))):
            remaining[i] = -remaining[i]
        
        print(sum(remaining))

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- Alice removes the k largest elements by sorting the array and keeping only the smallest `n-k` elements.
- Bob then flips the x smallest elements among the remaining elements to minimize the sum.
- The final sum is computed and printed for each test case.
