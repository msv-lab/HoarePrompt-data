### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This helps in easily accessing the largest and smallest elements.

3. **Initial Calculation (`ans1`):**
   - `ans1` is initialized to the sum of all elements in the array.
   - Bob can flip the sign of up to `x` elements. The optimal strategy for Bob would be to flip the `x` largest elements to minimize the sum. Thus, `ans1` is adjusted by subtracting twice the sum of the `x` largest elements (since flipping a positive number `a[i]` to `-a[i]` reduces the sum by `2 * a[i]`).

4. **Considering Alice's Moves (`ans2`):**
   - Alice can remove up to `k` elements. The optimal strategy for Alice would be to remove the `k` largest elements to maximize the sum.
   - For each possible number of elements Alice removes (`i` from `0` to `k`), the program adjusts `ans1` by adding back the `i` largest elements (since removing them increases the sum) and subtracting twice the next `x` largest elements if applicable.
   - The maximum value of `ans1` across all these scenarios is stored in `ans2`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans2` for each test case, which represents the optimal sum after both players have made their moves.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 1 1`, `1`
  - Output: `0`
  - Alice removes the only element, resulting in a sum of `0`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `4 1 1`, `3 1 2 4`
  - Output: `2`
  - Alice does not remove any elements. Bob flips `4` to `-4`, resulting in a sum of `3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2`.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `6 6 3`, `1 4 3 2 5 6`
  - Output: `0`
  - Alice removes `5`, `6`. Bob flips `4`, `3`, `3` to `-4`, `-3`, `-3`, resulting in a sum of `1 - 4 - 3 - 3 = -9`.

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `6 6 1`, `3 7 3 3 32 15`
  - Output: `3`
  - Alice removes `32`, `15`. Bob flips `7` to `-7`, resulting in a sum of `3 + 3 + 3 - 7 = -8`.

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `8 5 3`, `5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9`
  - Output: `-5`
  - Alice removes `9`, `9`. Bob flips `5`, `5`, `3` to `-5`, `-5`, `-3`, resulting in a sum of `-5 - 5 - 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = -5`.

- **Test Case 8:**
  - Input: `10 6 4`, `1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200`
  - Output: `-9`
  - Alice removes `200`, `9`, `8`, `5`. Bob flips `4`, `4`, `3`, `3` to `-4`, `-4`, `-3`, `-3`, resulting in a sum of `1 + 2 + 3 + 3 - 4 - 4 - 3 - 3 = -9`.

- **Test Case 9:**
  - Input: `2 2 1`, `4 3`
  - Output: `0`
  - Alice removes `4`, `3`. Bob flips `3` to `-3`, resulting in a sum of `0`.

- **Test Case 10:**
  - Input: `1 3`, `1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Alice does not remove any elements. Bob flips `1` to `-1`, resulting in a sum of `-1`.

The program correctly handles the provided test cases and adheres to the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob.
