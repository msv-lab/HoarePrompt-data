Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `x + (n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 4; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program execution will exit the most internal loop or if statement.
