Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is a non-zero integer and `n` has been updated to `n // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` was updated.**

In simpler terms, the value of `n` has been halved (using integer division), while the other variables remain unchanged except for `x`, which retains its value from before `n` was updated.
