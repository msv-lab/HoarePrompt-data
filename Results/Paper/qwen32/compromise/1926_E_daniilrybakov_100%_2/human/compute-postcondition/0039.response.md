Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is a non-zero integer that has been updated to `n // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `x`; `m` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` was updated**.

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be equal to the value of `x`. All other variables retain their previously described properties and values.
