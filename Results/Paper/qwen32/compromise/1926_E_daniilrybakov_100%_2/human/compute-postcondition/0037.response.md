Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is a non-zero integer that has been updated to `n // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` was updated. The condition `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged except for the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
