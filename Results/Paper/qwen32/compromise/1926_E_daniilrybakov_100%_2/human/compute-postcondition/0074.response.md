The code snippet `s += x` increments the variable `s` by the value of `x`. Given that `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `s` will be the previous value of `s` plus `(n + 1) // 2`. The conditions involving `s` and `k` (`if s < k and k <= s + x`) are not directly relevant to the calculation of the new state of `s` and `x`, but they will affect the flow of the program outside of this specific operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 1 (specifically, `n` is the floor of its original value divided by 2); `k` is the second input integer; `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 2; `_` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
