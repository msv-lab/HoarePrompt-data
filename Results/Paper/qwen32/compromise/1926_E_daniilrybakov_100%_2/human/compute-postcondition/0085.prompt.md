Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    m = 1
    while n:
        x = (n + 1) // 2
        n //= 2
        if s < k and k <= s + x:
            break
        s += x
        m *= 2
    print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` is 0; `k` is an input integer; `s` is the accumulated sum of `(n + 1) // 2` values from each iteration; `m` is `2^i`, where `i` is the number of iterations the loop executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is 0; `k` is an input integer; `s` is the sum of all (n_i + 1) // 2 values where n_i is the value of n at each iteration; `m` is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations the loop executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: - `t` remains the same as the initial input integer.
- `n` becomes 0.
- `k` remains the same as the initial input integer.
- `s` is the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- `m` is `2^i` where `i` is the number of iterations.
- `_` remains 1.

In simple terms, the loop runs until `n` becomes 0, doubling `m` each time, and adding the appropriate value to `s` in each iteration. The final state is when `n` is 0, `s` is the accumulated sum, and `m` is a power of 2.

Output State:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
