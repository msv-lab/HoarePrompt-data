The code snippet assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `x`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is an input integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
