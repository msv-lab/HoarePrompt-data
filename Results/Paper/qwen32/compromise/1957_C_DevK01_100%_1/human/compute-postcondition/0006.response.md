Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, representing the i-th move, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, `dp` is a list with the values [5, 9], `i` is 3.**
