To determine the output state, we need to compute the new value being appended to the `dp` list based on the provided formula and the current state of the `dp` list.

Given:
- `dp` is a list with the initial values `[1, (1 + 2 * (i - 1) * 1) % 17]`.
- `i` is 3.

First, let's compute the second element of `dp`:
- `dp[1] = (1 + 2 * (3 - 1) * 1) % 17 = (1 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 17 = (1 + 4) % 17 = 5`.

So, the current `dp` list is `[1, 5]`.

Now, we need to compute the new value to append to `dp`:
- `dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]`
- `dp[-1]` is the last element of `dp`, which is `5`.
- `dp[-2]` is the second last element of `dp`, which is `1`.
- Plugging in the values, the new element is `(5 + 2 * (3 - 1) * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9) = (5 + 2 * 2 * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9) = (5 + 4) % (7 + 10 ** 9) = 9 % (7 + 10 ** 9) = 9`.

So, the new `dp` list becomes `[1, 5, 9]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, representing the i-th move, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, `dp` is a list with the values [1, 5, 9], `i` is 3**.
