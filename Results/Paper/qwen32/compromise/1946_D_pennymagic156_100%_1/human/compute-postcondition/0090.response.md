Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list containing `ai` values appended whenever `op` was 0 if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` is an empty list. `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0. `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`. The value of `v` modulo 2 is not 0.`**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Thus, all variables retain their initial values.
