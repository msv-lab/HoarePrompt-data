Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`. If `v` is even and not zero, `ans` is `max(-1, cnt)` where `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, which is at least 1. If `v` is 0, `ans` remains -1.**
