The `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Given that no changes are made to the variables `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `u`, or `v`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]` and `v % 2` is not equal to 0.**
