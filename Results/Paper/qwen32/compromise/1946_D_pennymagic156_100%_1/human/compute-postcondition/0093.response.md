Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list containing `ai` values appended whenever `op` was 0 if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` is an empty list. `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0. `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`. `v` is even and non-zero. `op` is 0. `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they are the values returned by `func_3()`. The list `a` retains its original form, which depends on the conditions involving `u` and `op`. The list `t` remains empty. The variable `u` keeps its value as `(x >> i) & 1` and is still not equal to 0. The variable `v` remains the sum of the bitwise operations on the elements of `a` and is still even and non-zero. The variables `op` and `cnt` are both set to 0 by the given code snippet.
