Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains `ai` values where `op` was 0 during each iteration if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` remains an empty list. `i` is 28. `u` is the 28th bit of `x`. `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`. `op` is 0. `ai` is 0. If `u == v == 0`, the state remains as described above. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`. If `op` is False, then `t` is a list containing `val` and `ai` is 0. Otherwise, `t` remains an empty list and `ai` is `val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least 30 elements, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` was initially `False`, `t` is a list containing `val` and `ai` is `0`. If `op` was initially `True`, `t` remains unchanged and `ai` is `0`. `val` is the 30th element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop terminates as there are no more elements in `a` after the 30th element; `op` is updated to `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`; `ai` is 0 if `op` was initially 0, otherwise `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`; `t` now contains `ai` as its last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
