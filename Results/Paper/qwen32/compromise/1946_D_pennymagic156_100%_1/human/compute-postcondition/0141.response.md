Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains `ai` values where `op` was 0 during each iteration if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` remains an empty list. `i` is 28. `u` is the 28th bit of `x`. `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`. `u` is not equal to 0.**
