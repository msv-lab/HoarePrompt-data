The given line of code modifies the value of `op`. Specifically, it performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `op` and the result of `(val >> i & 1)`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` is a list containing at least one `ai` value.
- `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list.
- `u` equals 0.
- `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`.
- `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` retains its original value.
- `val` is the second element of `a`.

The line `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` by XORing it with the least significant bit of `val` shifted right by `i` positions.

Since `val` is the second element of `a`, and `i` is not specified, we can denote the new value of `op` as `op` XORed with `(val >> i & 1)`.

Therefore, the updated value of `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.

No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least one `ai` value, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list, `u` equals 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1) ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` retains its original value, `val` is the second element of `a`.**
