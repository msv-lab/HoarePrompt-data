The given code snippet modifies the variable `ai` using the XOR operation with `val`. Given that `ai` is initially 0 and `val` is the third element of the list `a`, the new value of `ai` will be `val` because `0 ^ val` equals `val`.

Here's the updated state:

- `n` and `x` are still the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` is still a list with at least two elements.
- `t` is still a list containing `ai` as its first element and `ai` as its second element, but since `ai` has changed, `t` will now be `[val, val]`.
- `ans` is still -1.
- `u` is still `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` still equals 0.
- `v` is still the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]` and `v` is still even.
- `op` is still `(val >> i) & 1`.
- `ai` is now `val`.
- `val` is still the third element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list with at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `val` as its first element and `val` as its second element, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` equals 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]` and `v` is even, `op` is `(val >> i) & 1`, `ai` is `val`, `val` is the third element of `a`.**
