You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, x is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\) representing the favorite number, and a is a list of n non-negative integers each less than \(2^{30}\).
def func_5():
    n, x = func_3()
    a = func_1()
    t, ans = [], -1
    for i in range(29, -1, -1):
        u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
        
        if u == v == 0:
            continue
        
        if u == 0:
            if v % 2:
                return ans
            else:
                op = ai = 0
                for val in a:
                    op ^= val >> i & 1
                    ai ^= val
                    if not op:
                        t.append(ai)
                        ai = 0
                a, t = t, []
        elif v % 2:
            continue
        elif v:
            op = cnt = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                if not op:
                    cnt += 1
            ans = max(ans, cnt)
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing the accumulated `ai` values where `op` was 0 during each iteration if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, and `ans` is the maximum count of times `op` became 0 during the loop when `u != 0` and `v` is even and non-zero.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, and `a`. It returns -1 in Case_1, `n` (a value from `func_3()`) in Case_2, `ans` in Case_3, and the maximum value between `ans` and the length of list `a` in Case_4.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns `n`, which is one of the values returned by `func_3()`

Case_3: The program returns `ans`, which is undefined based on the provided code snippet. The state remains unchanged if `u == v == 0`.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of list `a`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
