The given code modifies the variable `ai` using the XOR operation with `val`. The initial state specifies that `ai` is either 0 or `val` depending on the initial value of `op`. After the XOR operation, the new value of `ai` will be calculated as follows:

- If `op` was initially False, `ai` was 0. After `ai ^= val`, `ai` becomes `val`.
- If `op` was initially True, `ai` was `val`. After `ai ^= val`, `ai` becomes `0` because `val ^ val` equals `0`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least 30 elements, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `t` is a list containing `val` if `op` was initially False, otherwise `t` is an empty list, `ai` is `val` if `op` was initially False, otherwise `ai` is `0`, `val` is the 30th element of `a`.**
