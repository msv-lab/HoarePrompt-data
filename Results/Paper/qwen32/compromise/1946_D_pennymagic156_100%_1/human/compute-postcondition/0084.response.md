Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list containing at least two `ai` values where the first `ai` value is the original value before the first XOR operation with `val`. If `op` was 0, `t` contains `ai` and `ai` is set to 0. Otherwise, `t` remains an empty list and now includes `ai`. `u` equals 0, and `v` is the sum of the bitwise AND of each element in `a` right-shifted by `i` bits. `op` is the result of `op` XOR the bitwise AND of `val` right-shifted by `i` bits. `val` is the third element of `a`. If `op` was 0, `ai` is 0.**
