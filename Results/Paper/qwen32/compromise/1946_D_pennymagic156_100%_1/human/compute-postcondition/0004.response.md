To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

```python
u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
```

Here's what happens:
- `u` is assigned the value of `(x >> i) & 1`. This means `x` is right-shifted by `i` bits and then bitwise ANDed with 1, which effectively extracts the `i`th bit of `x`.
- `v` is assigned the sum of the `i`th bits of each element in the list `a`. This is done by iterating over each element `val` in `a`, right-shifting `val` by `i` bits, and then bitwise ANDing with 1 to get the `i`th bit, and finally summing these bits.

Given the initial state, the values of `n` and `x` are returned by `func_3()`, `a` is returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, and `ans` is -1. None of these values are directly modified by the given code snippet except for the introduction of `u` and `v`.

Therefore, the output state includes the new variables `u` and `v` with their respective calculated values, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`**.
