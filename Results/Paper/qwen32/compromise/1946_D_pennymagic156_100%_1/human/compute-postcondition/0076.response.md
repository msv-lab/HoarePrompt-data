The code snippet appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Given the initial state, `t` contains `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise it remains an empty list. After executing the code, `t` will definitely contain `ai` because the `append` operation adds `ai` to `t` regardless of its previous state.

Here's the updated state:

- `n` and `x` are still the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` is a list containing at least one `ai` value where the first `ai` value is now `ai ^ val`.
- `t` now contains `ai` (regardless of the initial value of `op`).
- `u` equals 0.
- `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`.
- `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- `ai` is `ai ^ val`.
- `val` is the second element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least one `ai` value where the first `ai` value is now `ai ^ val`, `t` contains `ai`, `u` equals 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `val` is the second element of `a`**.
