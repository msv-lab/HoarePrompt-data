The given code snippet performs a bitwise XOR operation between the variable `ai` and `val`. Initially, `ai` is set to 0. After executing `ai ^= val`, the new value of `ai` will be the result of `0 ^ val`, which is simply `val`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ai` will be `val`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the 28th bit of `val`, `ai` is `val`**.
