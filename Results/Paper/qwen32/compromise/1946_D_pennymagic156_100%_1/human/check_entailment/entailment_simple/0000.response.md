### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Overview of the Problem:
We need to partition the array `a` into the maximum number of contiguous subarrays such that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of these subarrays is less than or equal to `x`.

#### Key Points in the Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_3()` reads two integers `n` and `x`.
   - `func_1()` reads the array `a` of length `n`.

2. **Main Logic (`func_5`):**
   - The algorithm iterates over each bit position from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB) of `x` (from 29 down to 0).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`.
     - `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
   
   - **Case Analysis:**
     - If both `u` and `v` are zero, we skip this bit position.
     - If `u` is zero and `v` is odd, it is impossible to partition the array such that the condition holds, so we return `-1`.
     - If `u` is zero and `v` is even, we try to partition the array such that the XOR of each subarray has its `i`-th bit zero.
     - If `u` is one and `v` is odd, we skip this bit position.
     - If `u` is one and `v` is even and non-zero, we count the maximum number of subarrays whose XOR results in the `i`-th bit being zero.
   
   - The final result is the maximum count of such subarrays found during the iterations.

3. **Returning the Result:**
   - The function returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the array `a`. This ensures that if no valid partitions are found, the function will return `-1`.

#### Evaluation:
- The logic seems to correctly handle the constraints and conditions specified in the problem statement.
- The use of bitwise operations to check and manipulate the bits of `x` and the elements of `a` is appropriate.
- The handling of edge cases, such as when `x` is zero or when the array cannot be partitioned, appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program seems to correctly solve the problem as described. There are no apparent logical errors or issues in the implementation.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
