You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function processes a list of integers `a` and a favorite number `x` to determine a value based on bitwise operations. It returns either -1, the length of the list `a`, or the maximum count of certain conditions met during the processing.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to partition the array `a` into the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_k, r_k]` such that:
     - `l_1 = 1` and `r_k = n`.
     - Each segment `[l_i, r_i]` satisfies `l_i <= r_i`.
     - Consecutive segments must be contiguous: `r_i + 1 = l_{i+1}`.
     - The bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of these segments must be less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Approach in the Code:**
   - The code iterates over the bits of `x` from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It checks if the `i-th` bit of `x` (`u`) and the total count of `i-th` bits set in the array `a` (`v`) are both zero. If so, it skips to the next bit.
     - If the `i-th` bit of `x` is zero (`u == 0`), but the count of `i-th` bits set in `a` is odd (`v % 2`), it returns `-1` because it's impossible to partition the array to satisfy the condition.
     - If the `i-th` bit of `x` is zero and the count of `i-th` bits set in `a` is even, it tries to partition the array based on the `i-th` bit.
     - If the `i-th` bit of `x` is one (`u == 1`) and the count of `i-th` bits set in `a` is odd, it skips to the next bit.
     - If the `i-th` bit of `x` is one and the count of `i-th` bits set in `a` is even and non-zero, it counts how many segments can be formed such that the `i-th` bit of their XOR is zero.
     - It keeps track of the maximum number of such segments found (`ans`).

3. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all bits, it returns the maximum number of segments found (`ans`), or the length of the array `a` if no segments were found.

### Issues with the Code:

- **Logic Error:** The logic for partitioning based on the `i-th` bit seems flawed. Specifically, the way it handles the case when the `i-th` bit of `x` is zero and the count of `i-th` bits set in `a` is even is incorrect. It should ensure that the segments formed have a bitwise XOR that respects the constraints, not just count the bits.
- **Edge Cases:** The code does not handle some edge cases properly, such as when `x` is zero or when the array has only one element.
- **Complexity:** The approach might not be efficient enough for large inputs due to the nested loops and repeated calculations.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
