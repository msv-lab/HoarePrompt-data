### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments in the array `a` such that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of these segments is less than or equal to a given number `x`.

Let's break down the logic of `func_5()`:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `n, x = func_3()`: Reads the first two integers which represent the length of the array `a` and the favorite number `x`.
   - `a = func_1()`: Reads the array `a` of length `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `t, ans = [], -1`: Initializes an empty list `t` and sets `ans` to `-1`. `t` seems to be used to store intermediate results, and `ans` will hold the final answer.

3. **Processing Each Bit Position:**
   - The loop `for i in range(29, -1, -1):` iterates over each bit position from the most significant bit (29th bit) to the least significant bit (0th bit).

4. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - `u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`: 
     - `u` checks if the `i-th` bit of `x` is set.
     - `v` counts how many elements in `a` have the `i-th` bit set.
   
5. **Conditions Based on Bit Values:**
   - If both `u` and `v` are zero, it skips to the next iteration.
   - If `u` is zero and `v` is odd, it immediately returns `ans` because it's impossible to split the array under these conditions.
   - If `u` is zero and `v` is even, it processes the array to ensure the `i-th` bit condition is met:
     - `op` keeps track of the cumulative XOR of the `i-th` bits.
     - `ai` accumulates the XOR of the entire numbers.
     - When `op` becomes zero, it means a segment can be formed, and `ai` is added to `t`.
     - After processing, `a` is updated to `t` and `t` is reset.
   - If `u` is one and `v` is odd, it skips to the next iteration.
   - If `u` is one and `v` is even and non-zero, it counts the number of segments that can be formed without violating the condition and updates `ans`.
   - If `u` is one and `v` is zero, it breaks out of the loop.

6. **Final Output:**
   - `return max(ans, len(a))`: Returns the maximum of `ans` and the length of `a`. This ensures that if no valid segments were found (`ans` remains `-1`), the length of `a` is returned as the default answer.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_5()` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of segments in the array `a` such that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of these segments is less than or equal to `x`. The function handles all edge cases and constraints specified in the problem statement.
