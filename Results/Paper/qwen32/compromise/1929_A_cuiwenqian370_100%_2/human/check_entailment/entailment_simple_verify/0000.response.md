### Reasoning

Let's break down the program and the annotations to ensure the assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap

The goal is to maximize the beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

#### Program Breakdown

1. **`func_1(array)`**:
   - **Sorting**: The array is sorted. Sorting in either ascending or descending order will maximize the beauty because the largest differences will be between the smallest and largest elements, the second smallest and second largest, and so on.
   - **Beauty Calculation**: The function iterates through the sorted array, calculates the absolute differences between consecutive elements, and sums them up.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the entire input at once, splits it into a list of strings, and then processes each test case.
   - **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it extracts the number of elements, the elements themselves, and then calculates the beauty using `func_1`.
   - **Output**: It stores the results for each test case and prints them at the end.

#### Annotations

- **`func_1(array)`**:
  - **State Before Function Call**: `array` is a list of integers with length `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), and each element in the array is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
  - **State After Sorting**: `array` is a sorted list of integers.
  - **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty is correctly calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
  
- **`func_2()`**:
  - **State Before Function Call**: The input is read and split into a list of strings.
  - **Processing Each Test Case**: The function correctly processes each test case by extracting the number of elements and the elements themselves, then calculates the beauty using `func_1`.
  - **Output**: The results are correctly stored and printed.

#### Evaluation

The annotations and the original assessment both indicate that the program correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach is sound and aligns with the problem description.

- **Sorting**: Sorting the array in ascending or descending order will indeed maximize the beauty.
- **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty calculation is correctly implemented by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

#### Edge Cases

- **All Elements the Same**: If all elements are the same, the beauty will be 0, as the differences between consecutive elements will be 0.
- **Two Elements**: For two elements, the beauty is simply the absolute difference between the two elements.
- **Larger Arrays**: The program handles arrays up to the maximum size specified (100 elements).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. It also correctly handles multiple test cases.

**Final: True**
