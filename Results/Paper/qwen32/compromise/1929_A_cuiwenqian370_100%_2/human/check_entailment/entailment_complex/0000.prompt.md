Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each element in the array is an integer satisfying 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: `array` is a sorted list of integers with length `n` such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, and each element in the array is an integer satisfying 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the beauty, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, sorts the list, and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers with length n (2 <= n <= 100), and each integer a_i in array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: - After all iterations, `index` will have been incremented by `1` for each iteration (to get `n`), and by `n` for each iteration (to get the `array` elements). Therefore, `index` will be `1 + 2 * t + sum(n_i)`, where `n_i` is the value of `n` in the `i-th` iteration.
    #   - `results` will contain `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(array)` for the respective `array` in each iteration.
    #   - `array` will hold the last `array` that was processed in the loop.
    #   - `t` and `data` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    #
    #Given that `func_1(array)` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of the `results` list. However, we can describe the state of the variables as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `index` will be `1 + 2 * t + sum(n_i)`, where `n_i` is the value of `n` in the `i-th` iteration. `results` will contain `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(array)` for the respective `array` in each iteration. `array` will hold the last `array` that was processed in the loop. `t` and `data` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The loop provided (`for result in results: print(result)`) will print each element in the `results` list, but this does not change the state of the variables.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it processes the list of integers using an undefined function `func_1` and stores the result. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.
