You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it processes the list of integers using an undefined function `func_1` and stores the result. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the elements of the array in any way we like.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(array)`: This function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Function `func_1(array)`

- **Sorting the Array**: The function sorts the array. Sorting the array in ascending or descending order will maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements because the largest differences will be between the smallest and largest elements, the second smallest and second largest, and so on.
- **Calculating Beauty**: The function iterates through the sorted array and calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

### Function `func_2()`

- **Reading Input**: The function reads the entire input at once, splits it into a list of strings, and then processes each test case.
- **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it extracts the number of elements, the elements themselves, and then calculates the beauty using `func_1`.
- **Printing Results**: It stores the results for each test case and prints them at the end.

### Correctness Verification

The key idea here is that sorting the array in either ascending or descending order will yield the maximum beauty. The provided program sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the beauty correctly. The logic is sound, and it handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

### Edge Cases Considered

- **All Elements the Same**: If all elements are the same, the beauty will be 0, as the differences between consecutive elements will be 0.
- **Two Elements**: For two elements, the beauty is simply the absolute difference between the two elements.
- **Larger Arrays**: The program handles arrays up to the maximum size specified (100 elements).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. It also correctly handles multiple test cases.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program sorts the array and calculates the beauty correctly for all possible test cases, including edge cases like all elements being the same, arrays with only two elements, and larger arrays up to the maximum size specified.
