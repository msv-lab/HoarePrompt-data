Let's carefully analyze the provided program to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

### Problem Recap
The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The strategy to maximize this beauty is to sort the array in either ascending or descending order.

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1(array)`
- **Sorting**: The function sorts the array. Sorting in ascending or descending order will maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- **Beauty Calculation**: The function iterates through the sorted array and calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

#### Function `func_2()`
- **Input Reading**: The function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
- **Processing**: For each test case, it extracts the number of elements, the elements themselves, and then calculates the beauty using `func_1`.
- **Output**: It stores the results for each test case and prints them at the end.

### Function Summary
The summary for `func_2` indicates that it reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results, which aligns with the provided code.

### Verification
The key idea is that sorting the array in ascending or descending order will yield the maximum beauty. The provided program sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the beauty correctly. The logic is sound and handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

### Edge Cases
- **All Elements the Same**: If all elements are the same, the beauty will be 0, as the differences between consecutive elements will be 0.
- **Two Elements**: For two elements, the beauty is simply the absolute difference between the two elements.
- **Larger Arrays**: The program handles arrays up to the maximum size specified (100 elements).

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. It also correctly handles multiple test cases.

### Final Evaluation
**Final: True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.
