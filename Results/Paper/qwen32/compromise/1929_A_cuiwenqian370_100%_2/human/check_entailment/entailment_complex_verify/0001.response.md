### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution using the annotations and the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires maximizing the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any way. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in either ascending or descending order. This is because the absolute differences will be maximized when the elements are as far apart as possible, which happens in a sorted array (either ascending or descending).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - **Annotation**: The function sorts the array and then iterates through the sorted array to compute the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Correctness**: The annotation correctly describes the function's behavior. Sorting the array and then summing the consecutive differences is indeed a valid approach to compute the maximum beauty. Since the array is sorted, the absolute differences are maximized.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Annotation**: The function reads input from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and the elements of each array. It then processes each test case by reading the length of the array and the array elements, calling `func_1(array)` to compute the maximum beauty, and storing the result. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - **Correctness**: The annotation correctly describes the function's behavior. The function handles multiple test cases, reads the input correctly, and outputs the results as required.

#### Conclusion:
Both functions are correctly implemented according to the problem description and the annotations. The program sorts the array and computes the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array. The program also correctly handles multiple test cases and processes the input/output as specified.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and computing the sum of consecutive differences. It handles multiple test cases and processes the input/output as specified in the problem description.

**Final: True**
