To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and output against the problem requirements. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Graph Construction**: We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to vertices numbered from 1 to n. An edge is added between vertices i and j if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k.
2. **Clique Partitioning**: The graph must be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
    - Computes the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
    - Initializes two arrays: `arr` for vertex labels and `cliquess` for clique assignments.
    - Iterates over each clique and calls `make_array` to populate `arr` and `cliquess` for that clique.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
    - Assigns values from `left + 1` to `right + 1` to vertices in the range `[left, right]`.
    - Assigns the same clique number to all vertices in the range `[left, right]`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Arrays**: The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are used globally in `make_array`, but they are not declared as global in the function. This will lead to a `NameError` because Python treats variables defined in the outer scope as read-only unless explicitly declared as global.
   
2. **Vertex Labeling**: The function `make_array` assigns labels in a sequential manner within each clique, which might not guarantee that the edge condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k is satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. For example, if `k` is small, the labels might be too far apart, violating the edge condition.

3. **Clique Count**: The formula `ceil(n / k)` for the number of cliques may not always yield the minimum number of cliques required. The optimal partitioning strategy is not clearly defined in the program.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the results for each test case, but the format is not validated against the problem requirements.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the provided program with the first test case: `n = 2`, `k = 3`.
- The program calculates `cliques = ceil(2 / 3) = 1`.
- It assigns `arr = [1, 2]` and `cliquess = [1, 1]`.
- The edge condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ 3 is satisfied for the pair (1, 2), so the output is correct for this case.

However, the program may not work correctly for all test cases due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with global variable usage, the vertex labeling strategy, and the clique count formula, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
