Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the given program.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to vertices of a graph.
- We need to add edges between vertices (i, j) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).
- The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
- Each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. Here's what they do:
1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` to store the assignments and clique numbers.
   - It calls `make_array` for each segment of the array to fill it with values and assign clique numbers.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
   - It fills the segment of `arr` from `left` to `right` with values.
   - It assigns values to the first half of the segment in increasing order starting from `left + 1`.
   - It assigns values to the second half of the segment in decreasing order starting from `right + 1`.
   - It assigns the same clique number to all elements in the segment.

### Function Summary Recap
- The function `make_array` modifies a portion of the array `arr` between the indices `left` and `right` by setting the first half to increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half to decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. It also sets the corresponding elements in the `cliquess` array to the given `clique` number.

### Issues Identified
1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. This is problematic and can lead to undefined behavior if the variables are not properly initialized in the global scope before calling these functions.

2. **Logic Errors in `make_array`**:
   - The logic for filling the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays in `make_array` does not ensure that the values assigned to `arr` are distinct integers from 1 to n.
   - The way elements are assigned does not guarantee that the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) is satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

3. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
   - The function `make_array` does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when `k` is small relative to `n`.

4. **Example of Incorrect Output**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The program might output something like:
     ```
     1 2 3 4 5
     1
     1 1 1 1 1
     ```
     This output is incorrect because the graph with `n = 5` and `k = 4` can be partitioned into fewer than 1 clique. For example, a valid output could be:
     ```
     1 3 5 2 4
     2
     1 1 1 2 2
     ```
     Here, the vertices are partitioned into two cliques, and the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) is satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

5. **Lack of Input Handling**:
   - The provided code does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It only defines functions but does not read input or process multiple test cases.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality and fails to meet the problem description for various potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Final: **False**
