Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer from the input minus 1, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the input minus 1 and currently equals 0, `bm` is `a[b] * (k - 1)` and currently equals `a[b] * -1`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k - 1)` and currently equals `a[s] * -1`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `sp` is `a[s]`. The condition `bm > sm` holds if `a[b] * (k - 1) > a[s] * (k - 1)`, which simplifies to `a[b] < a[s]` given the current value of `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables do not change, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
