The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `t` must be at least 1 because the loop iterates `t` times. The variable `i` is the loop counter and is automatically initialized to 0 before the loop starts, so we don't need to adjust it manually.

State: **`t` is the integer value obtained from the input, which must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
