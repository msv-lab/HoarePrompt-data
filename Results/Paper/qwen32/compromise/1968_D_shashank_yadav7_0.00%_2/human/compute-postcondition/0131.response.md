The code snippet `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` updates the value of `sm`. To determine the new value of `sm`, we need to compare `sm` with `a[s] * k + sp` and then add the larger of the two to `sm`.

Given:
- `sm` is the current value of `sm`.
- `a[s]` is the element at index `s` in the list `a`.
- `k` is the second integer from the input minus 2.
- `sp` is the current value of `sp`.

The new value of `sm` will be `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sm` has been updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
