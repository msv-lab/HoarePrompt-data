The given initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the print statement in the code snippet is simply `print('Draw')`. This means that regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`, the output will be the string 'Draw'.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is initially set to `k`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `k` is 0.
- `b` and `s` are defined through nested indexing of the list `p`, but since `k` is 0, the nested indexing does not occur, and `b` and `s` would be equivalent to `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1` (nested 0 times), which simplifies to `b` and `s` being undefined or not used in the context of the print statement.
- `p` is a list of integers from the input.
- `a` is a new list of integers from the input.
- `bm` and `sm` are the maximum values accumulated over `k` iterations (which is 0, so no iterations occur).
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for `k` iterations (which is 0, so no iterations occur).
- `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for `k` iterations (which is 0, so no iterations occur).
- Additionally, `bm` is explicitly set to `sm`.

Since the print statement is `print('Draw')`, it will output the string 'Draw' directly.

Output: **Draw**
