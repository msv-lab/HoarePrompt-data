To determine what will be printed when the `print('Draw')` statement is executed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the context in which the print statement is placed.

The initial state describes several variables and their relationships:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `min(n, k_initial)`, where `n` and `k_initial` are integers from the input.
- `b` and `s` are updated `i` times based on `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively, where `p` is a list of integers.
- `a` is a list of integers from the new input.
- `k` is `max(0, k_initial - i)`.
- `bm` and `sm` are accumulated values after `i` iterations.
- `bp` and `sp` are accumulated values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` after `i` iterations.
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

The print statement is `print('Draw')`. This statement does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k_initial`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `k`, `bm`, `sm`, `bp`, or `sp`. It simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Given this, the output will be:
Output: **Draw**
