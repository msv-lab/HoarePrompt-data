The code snippet `sp += a[s]` modifies the value of `sp` by adding the value of `a[s]` to it. Given the initial state, `sp` is already defined as `sp + 2 * a[s]`. After executing the code, `sp` will be updated to `sp + 2 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `sp + 3 * a[s]`.

Here is the output state with all the necessary information:

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain as described in the initial state; `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is `sp + 3 * a[s]`; `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`.** 

In simple terms, `sp` has been increased by `3 * a[s]`, while all other variables retain their previous definitions and values.
