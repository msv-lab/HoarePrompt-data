The given code snippet modifies the variable `sm` by adding the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` to it. Let's break down the impact of this on the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is `k - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain as described in the initial state
- `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`
- `sp` is `sp + 2 * a[s]`
- `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`

The code snippet:
```python
sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
```

This line updates `sm` by adding the maximum value between the current `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` to `sm`. Therefore, the new value of `sm` will be:
- `sm = sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`

Since `sm` is already updated in the initial state, the new value of `sm` will be:
- `sm = (sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`

However, since `sm` is already the result of `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, the additional `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` term will not change the value of `sm` further.

Thus, the final value of `sm` remains as `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain as described in the initial state; `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is `sp + 2 * a[s]`; `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`.**
