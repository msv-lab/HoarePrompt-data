The code snippet `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. Given the initial state, the value of `sp` is updated, but other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value obtained from the input, which must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, and `sm` remain as described in the initial state; if `k` is 0, `bm` is `max(bm, bp)`; if `k` is not 0, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. `sp` is `sp + a[s]`.**
