Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`; a list `p` of `n` integers; and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates two cumulative scores, `bm` and `sm`, based on the provided values and rules, and prints "Bodya" if `bm` is greater, "Sasha" if `sm` is greater, or "Draw" if they are equal.**
