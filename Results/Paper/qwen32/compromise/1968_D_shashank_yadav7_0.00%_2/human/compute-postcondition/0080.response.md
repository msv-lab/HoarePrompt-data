To determine the new value of `sm`, we need to evaluate the expression `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `sm` is `max(0, a[s])`
- `a[s]` is a specific integer value from the list `a`
- `k` is -1
- `sp` is `2 * a[s]`

Let's break it down:

1. Calculate `a[s] * k + sp`:
   - `a[s] * k` is `a[s] * -1`, which is `-a[s]`
   - `-a[s] + sp` is `-a[s] + 2 * a[s]`, which simplifies to `a[s]`

2. Determine the new value of `sm`:
   - `sm` was initially `max(0, a[s])`
   - The expression to add to `sm` is `max(sm, a[s])`
   - Since `a[s]` is a positive integer (as `sm` is `max(0, a[s])` and `sm` is greater than 0), `max(sm, a[s])` is simply `a[s]`
   - Therefore, `sm` becomes `sm + a[s]`, which is `max(0, a[s]) + a[s]`

Given that `sm` is initially `max(0, a[s])` and `a[s]` is positive, `sm` is simply `a[s]`. Adding `a[s]` to `sm` results in `sm` being `2 * a[s]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`, `sm` is `2 * a[s]`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`.**
