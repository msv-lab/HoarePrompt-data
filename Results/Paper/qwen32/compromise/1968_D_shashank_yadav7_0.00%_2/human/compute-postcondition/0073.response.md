The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`, `sm` is `max(0, a[s])`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`**
