Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer from the input minus 1, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the input minus 1. If `k` equals 0, then `bm` is `a[b] * -1`, `sm` is `a[s] * -1`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `sp` is `a[s]`, and the condition `bm > sm` simplifies to `a[b] < a[s]`. If `a[b] < a[s]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
