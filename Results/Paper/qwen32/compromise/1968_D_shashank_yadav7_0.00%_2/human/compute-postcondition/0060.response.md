The code snippet `bm = a[b] * k` updates the value of `bm` to be the product of `a[b]` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is the number of iterations completed (min(n, number of iterations until `k` becomes 0)) + 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `b` is the third integer from the input minus 1; `s` is the fourth integer from the input minus 1; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `a` is a new list of integers from the input; `bm` is `a[b] * k`; `sm` is updated `i` times to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is either less than `sm` or greater than or equal to `sm`.**
