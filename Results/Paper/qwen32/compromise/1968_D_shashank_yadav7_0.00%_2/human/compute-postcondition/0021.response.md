The code snippet provided is `bp += a[b]`. This means that the value of `bp` is incremented by the value of `a[b]`. 

Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true.
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`.
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`.
- `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, and `sm` remain as described in the initial state.
- If `k` is 0, `bm` is `max(bm, bp)`.
- If `k` is not 0, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.
- `sp` is `sp + a[s]`.

The only change made by the code snippet is that `bp` is increased by `a[b]`. Therefore, the updated value of `bp` will be `bp + a[b]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `sm` remain as described in the initial state; if `k` is 0, `bm` is `max(bm, bp)`; if `k` is not 0, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is `sp + a[s]`; `bp` is `bp + a[b]`.**
