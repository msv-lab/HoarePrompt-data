Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of cases, and `cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each tuple in `cases`, the function generates a tuple `(25, sequence)` and appends it to a results list. The `sequence` is a predefined list of the first 25 powers of 2 starting from 2^0 up to 2^24. The function returns the results list containing these tuples for each case.**
