Reasoning: The provided program is designed to count the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in each test case string `s` and print their sum as the result. This approach is based on the assumption that each occurrence of "map" or "pie" can be removed independently to make the string beautiful. However, this logic is flawed because the removal of characters to make the string beautiful might involve overlapping substrings or require a more strategic removal of characters than simply counting the occurrences.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in an output of 2. However, the string can be made beautiful by removing just 1 character (either the 'm' from "map" or the 'p' from "pie"), not 2.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful, which might not align with simply counting non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". Therefore, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
