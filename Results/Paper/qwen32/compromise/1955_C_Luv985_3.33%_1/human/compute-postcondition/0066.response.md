Postcondition: **`l` is the smallest index such that `a[l]` is non-zero or `r + 1` if all elements from `l` to `r` are zero; `r` is the largest index such that `a[r]` is non-zero or `l - 1` if all elements from `l` to `r` are zero; `k` is the remaining value after all possible operations; `a` has reduced values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` based on the operations; `ans` is the count of elements that were fully consumed. Additionally, `l` is equal to `r`.**
