Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` retains its value or is reduced by 2 * `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`; `a` is a list of `n` integers, where `a[0]` and `a[r]` may be reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`; `l` is either 0 or 1 if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `l` remains 0; `r` is either `n-2` or `n-3` if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `r` remains `n-1` or `n-2`; `ans` is incremented by 1 if either `a[0]` or `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, or set based on `mi - t - k // 2` if `mi * 2 > k`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[r]` before or after the operation depending on the condition.**
