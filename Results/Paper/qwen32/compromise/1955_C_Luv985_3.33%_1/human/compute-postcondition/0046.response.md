Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` is 0; `r` is either `n-1` or `n-2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[r]`; `t` is either 0 or 1. If `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, `ans` is set to 3 if both `a[0]` and `a[r]` are 0, or 2 if only `a[0]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `mi - t - k // 2` does not equal 0, `ans` is set to 2.**
