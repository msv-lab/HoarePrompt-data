The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Given the initial state, `l` was 0, so after the increment, `l` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` and `a[r]` are decreased by `mi`, `ans` is 1, `T` is truthy and has been decremented by 1, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, and `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`. Additionally, `a[l]` is 0.**
