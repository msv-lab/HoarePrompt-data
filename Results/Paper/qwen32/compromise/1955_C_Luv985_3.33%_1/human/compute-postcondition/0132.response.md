Postcondition: **`l` is 2 if it was 1, or `l` is 3 if it was 2; `r` is `n - 3` if `l` was 1, otherwise `r` is `n - 4` if `l` was 2; `k` is greater than 0; `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[r]` was 0. Otherwise, `l` remains 1 if it was 0, or `l` remains 2 if it was 1; `r` remains `n - 2` if `l` is 1, otherwise `r` remains `n - 3` if `l` is 2; `k` is greater than `mi * 2`; `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`; `t` is `k % 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`.**
