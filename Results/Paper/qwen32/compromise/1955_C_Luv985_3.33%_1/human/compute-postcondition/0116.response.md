Postcondition: **`l` is 1 if it was 0, or `l` is 2 if it was 1. `r` is `n - 2` if `l` was 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 3` if `l` was 1, if `mi * 2 <= k`. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 or 1, and `r` remains `n - 1` if `l` is 0, or `r` remains `n - 2` if `l` is 1. `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`. `a` is a list of integers where `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` and `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` are decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`. `ans` is 4 if `a[l]` was 0 and `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is 3 if `a[l]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 3 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if `a[r] == 0` if `mi * 2 <= k`. If `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is 3 if `a[l]` was 0 and `a[r]` was 0 and `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, `ans` is 2 if `a[l]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 2 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `a[l]` was 0, then `a[l]` is 0. The current value of `a[r]` is 0 if `a[r]` was 0. `T` is truthy and has been decremented by 1. `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is `k % 2`.**
