Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `T` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. The current value of `a[r]` (which is `a[n - 2]`) is not specified. `l` is 1 and `ans` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` becomes `n - 2` instead of `n - 1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
