Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is 0, `T` is truthy and has been decremented by 1, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

In natural language: The variable `t` is now assigned the value of `k % 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
