Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is decreased by `mi` and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is 0, `T` is truthy and has been decremented by 1, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, and `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`. All other variables retain their previous states.
