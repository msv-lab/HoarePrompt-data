grid is a list of strings, where each string consists of '0' and '1' characters, representing a binary square grid. The length of grid (n) satisfies 2 <= n <= 10. Each string in grid has a length of n. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all the '1's, and the size of this shape (k) is greater than 1.
