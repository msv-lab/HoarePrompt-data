The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to the variable `n` based on the user input. This means the previous value of `n` (which was an input integer between 2 and 10) is replaced by whatever integer the user inputs next.

Since the new value of `n` is determined by the user input, we cannot specify a precise numerical value for `n` in the output state. However, we know that the new value of `n` will still be an integer between 2 and 10, inclusive, as per the precondition.

All other variables (`t`, `i`, the grid, `a`, `b`, `j`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10; the grid is an n x n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if there was at least one line with exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0; `b` is 'SQUARE'; `j` is n - 1; `s` is the last input string.**
