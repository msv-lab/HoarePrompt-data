You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: t
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the sorted list `a` and the integer `k`. The value is determined by distributing `k` across the elements of `a` in a particular manner and then computing a final result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum score for the described problem. Here are some issues with the code and a counterexample to demonstrate its incorrectness:

1. **Handling of Remaining Coins (`k`)**: The code does not correctly handle the remaining coins after making the array as balanced as possible. Specifically, the logic for distributing the remaining coins (`rem` and `y`) is flawed.

2. **Final Calculation**: The final calculation for the score is incorrect. The formula `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` does not accurately reflect the number of valid subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where `n` is small or `k` is large effectively. For example, when `n` is 1, the score should simply be the number of cards of type 1 plus the number of coins `k`, but the code does not handle this correctly.

### Counterexample:

Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3 4
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
- We have 3 types of cards, each with 1 card initially.
- We can buy 4 more cards to make the array `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`.
- The valid subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of `[1, 2, 3]` are:
  - `[1, 2, 3]`
  - `[1, 2, 3]`
  - `[1, 2, 3]`
  - `[1, 2, 3]`
- Thus, the maximum score is 4.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will output a different value, likely incorrect, due to the flawed logic for handling the remaining coins and the final calculation.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the logic and the incorrect handling of edge cases, the program is not correct. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
