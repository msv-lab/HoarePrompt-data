To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the range function `range(0, n - 1)` must generate at least one value. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than 0, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 1.

Here are the variables in the loop head that need to be adjusted:
- `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 by the range function, so no adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts.
- `n`: This variable must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop executes.

The other variables (`t`, `ii`, `k`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, `r`) are not mentioned in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[0]`**
