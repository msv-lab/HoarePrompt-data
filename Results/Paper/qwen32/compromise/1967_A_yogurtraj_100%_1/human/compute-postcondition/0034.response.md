The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is 2, `r` will now hold the value of `a[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), `y` is 0, `r` is `a[3]`.**

In natural language: The value of `r` has been updated to the third element of the sorted list `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
