Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `i` is 2, `y` is `n - 3`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
