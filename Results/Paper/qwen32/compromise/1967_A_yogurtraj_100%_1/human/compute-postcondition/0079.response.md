To determine the final output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how the variables `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k` change based on the conditions given.

Let's break down the loop's behavior:

1. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (since the range is `range(0, n - 1)`).
2. For each iteration, the loop checks if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`.
   - If true, it sets `r` to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` to `k % (i + 1)`, `y` to `n - 1 - i`, and `k` to 0, then breaks out of the loop.
   - If false, it updates `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and sets `r` to `a[i + 1]`.

The loop will terminate either when the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is met or when `i` reaches `n - 2`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

- If the loop does not break in the first 3 iterations, it means that `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` was not greater than `k` for `i = 0, 1, 2`.
- The loop will continue until either the condition is met or `i` reaches `n - 2`.

Let's consider the final state:

- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it means that for all `i` from `0` to `n - 2`, the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) <= k` was true.
- In this case, `k` will be reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n - 2`.
- The final value of `r` will be `a[n - 1]` because the loop sets `r` to `a[i + 1]` in each iteration.
- `rem` will be `0` because the loop only sets `rem` if it breaks out, which it doesn't in this scenario.
- `y` will be `0` because the loop only sets `y` if it breaks out, which it doesn't in this scenario.
- `k` will be the initial `k` minus the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n - 2`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, ii is 1, n and k are integers obtained from the input, a is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, rem is 0, y is 0, and r is a[n - 1].**

In natural language: The final state after the loop completes all iterations is that `t` remains unchanged, `ii` remains 1, `n` and `k` remain as initially provided, `a` remains the same sorted list, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is the last element of the list `a`.
