Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `i` is 1. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then `y` is `n - 2`, `r` is `a[1]`, and `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, and `k` is decreased by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]).**
