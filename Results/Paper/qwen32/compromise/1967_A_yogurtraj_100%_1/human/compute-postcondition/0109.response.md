Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is `a[3]`. `i` is 3, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
