The code snippet provided is `y = 0`. This line of code sets the variable `y` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `y` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[0]`.**
