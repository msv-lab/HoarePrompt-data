The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `r` will be assigned the value of `a[2]` (the third element in the list `a`).

The values of the other variables (`t`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, `i`, `k`) remain unchanged by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[2]`**.
