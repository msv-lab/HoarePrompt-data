Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. The current value of `i` satisfies the condition that ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
