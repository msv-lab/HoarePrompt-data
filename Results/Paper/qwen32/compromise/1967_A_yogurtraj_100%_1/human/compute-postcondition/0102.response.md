The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` updates the value of `r` to be the element at index `i + 1` in the sorted list `a`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[i + 1]`. Additionally, it holds that ((`i` + 1) * (`a[i + 1]` - `a[i]`) <= `k`)**

In natural language: The value of `r` is now the element at index `i + 1` in the sorted list `a`. All other variables retain their previous values.
