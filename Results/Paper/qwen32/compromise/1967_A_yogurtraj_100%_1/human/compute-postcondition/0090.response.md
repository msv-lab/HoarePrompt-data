The code snippet `r = a[0]` assigns the value of the first element of the sorted list `a` to the variable `r`. This change affects the value of `r` while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[0]`.**
