You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence by repeatedly replacing a pair of adjacent elements where the first is greater than the second, with a new element formed by concatenating the digits of the first element and the second element, followed by sorting the resulting digits. It prints 'YES' if such a transformation is possible for the list, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the transformation and sorting logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for transforming the array and checking if it can be sorted is flawed.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Transformation Logic**:
   - The code only checks if the current element and the previous element can be transformed such that they form a non-decreasing sequence after splitting the previous element. However, this logic does not consider the possibility of transforming multiple elements or the correct sequence of transformations needed to sort the entire array.

2. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - The code checks if the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order by only considering adjacent elements and their immediate transformations. This is insufficient because the transformation can affect multiple elements and the order of transformations can be complex.

3. **Incorrect Transformation Handling**:
   - The code attempts to transform the array by splitting the previous element and checking if the resulting sequence is sorted. However, it does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be transformed, and the transformations need to be applied in a specific order to achieve a sorted array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the array requires multiple transformations to be sorted. For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The code correctly splits `12` to `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but it does not handle cases where further transformations are needed to sort the array. For example, the array `[34, 12, 56]` should be transformed to `[3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 6]` to be sorted, but the code does not handle such cases.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input**:
```
1
3
34 12 56
```

**Expected Output**:
```
YES
```

**Actual Output**:
```
NO
```

In this example, the array `[34, 12, 56]` can be transformed to `[3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 6]` and then sorted to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. However, the code does not handle this transformation correctly and outputs `NO`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
