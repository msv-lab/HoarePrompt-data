The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the loop statement `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`, the loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `1`, decrementing `i` by `1` in each iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was a certain value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by `1` and still be greater than or equal to `1`.

Let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` (where `k` is some value from `m - 1` down to `2`).
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `1`.

Therefore, if `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will terminate in the next iteration because `i` would become `1` and the loop condition `i > 0` would still be true, but the next decrement would make `i` equal to `0`, which would terminate the loop.

So, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

Given that the loop decrements `i` by `1` in each iteration, if `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next (and final) iteration, `i` will be `1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers where if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then the integer at index `i - 1` is now `nums[0]` and `arr[i]` is less than the integer at index `i - 1` before the update, with `nums` being a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` before the update followed by `arr[i]`. `ans` remains unchanged unless previously set to `False`. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr` and other variables remain unchanged; `i` is 1**
