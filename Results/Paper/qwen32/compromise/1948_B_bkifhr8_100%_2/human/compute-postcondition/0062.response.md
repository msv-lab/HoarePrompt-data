The code snippet provided simply sets the variable `ans` to `True`. This does not affect the values of any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `True` to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is the new input integer; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is `True`**.
