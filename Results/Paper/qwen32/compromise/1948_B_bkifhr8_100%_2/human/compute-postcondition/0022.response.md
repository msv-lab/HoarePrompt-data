The code snippet takes the `i-1`th element from the list `arr`, converts it to a string, then to a list of its individual digits (each digit as an integer), and appends the `i`th element of `arr` to this list. The result is stored in the variable `nums`.

Given the initial state, `i` is incremented from its previous value, and `arr` is a list of integers. The variable `nums` is created based on the described operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99; `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
