Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`; `nums` is a list created by converting the digits of `arr[i - 1]` into a list and appending `arr[i]` to it; `ans` is a boolean that remains True if `nums` is sorted, otherwise it is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr[i - 1]` or `nums`, and `ans` remains True.**
