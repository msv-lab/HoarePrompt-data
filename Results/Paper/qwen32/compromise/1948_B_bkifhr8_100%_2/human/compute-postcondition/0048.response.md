The code snippet provided updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to the first element of the list `nums`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `arr[i - 1]` corresponds to `arr[0]`. Therefore, `arr[0]` is set to `nums[0]`.

The other variables remain unchanged unless `nums` is not sorted, in which case `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, the code snippet does not include any logic to check if `nums` is sorted or to set `ans` to `False` or break the loop. Thus, we only need to reflect the change in `arr[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0]` is `nums[0]` and the rest of the elements remain unchanged; `i` is 1; `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`.**
