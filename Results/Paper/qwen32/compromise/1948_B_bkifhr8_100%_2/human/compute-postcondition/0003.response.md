The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list called `arr`. This operation does not affect the existing variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `m`. The new list `arr` is created based on the input provided at runtime.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99.**
