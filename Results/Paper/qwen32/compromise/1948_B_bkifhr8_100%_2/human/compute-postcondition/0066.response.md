Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is `True`. At the current index `i`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`; `nums` is a list of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `nums` is not sorted.**
