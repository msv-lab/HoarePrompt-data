The code snippet creates a new list `nums` by converting the integer `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and then appending `arr[i]` to this list.

Given the initial state, `arr[i - 1]` is an integer, and `arr[i]` is an integer. The list `nums` will contain the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.

For example, if `arr[i - 1]` is 123 and `arr[i]` is 4, then `nums` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99; `ans` is True; `nums` is a list created by converting the digits of `arr[i - 1]` into a list and appending `arr[i]` to it.**
