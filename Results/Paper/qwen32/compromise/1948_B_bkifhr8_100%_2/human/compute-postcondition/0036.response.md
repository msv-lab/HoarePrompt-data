The code snippet provided creates a new list `nums` by combining the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` of `arr` with the integer at index `i` of `arr`. 

Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is less than the previous one, and each integer is between 0 and 99. The variable `nums` is newly created and not part of the initial state, so it does not affect the other variables except for being created.

Since `arr[i - 1]` is an integer, converting it to a string and then to a list of its digits (each digit becomes an integer) and appending `arr[i]` to this list forms the new list `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99 and the current integer at index `i` is less than the integer at index `i - 1`; `ans` is a boolean that is `True`; `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
