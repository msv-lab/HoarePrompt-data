The given code snippet initializes `sums` based on the initial state of the variables. Specifically, it calculates `sums` as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` when `i` is 0.

Here's the breakdown:
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`.
- `a[:x]` represents the first `x` elements of the list `a`.
- `sum(a[:x])` is the sum of these first `x` elements.
- `sums` is initialized to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Since the code snippet only affects the variable `sums` and does not modify `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `sum1`, those variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`, where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
