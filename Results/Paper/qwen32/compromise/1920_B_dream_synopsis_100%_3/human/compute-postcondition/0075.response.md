Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that now includes `sums` as its last element, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `ans` now contains the current value of `sums` as its last element. No other variables have been altered except for `ans`, which has been updated to include the new value of `sums`.
