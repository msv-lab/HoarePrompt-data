The given code snippet recalculates the sum of the elements in the list `a`. However, since `sum1` was already defined as the sum of all elements in the original list `a`, executing `sum1 = sum(a)` does not change the value of `sum1` because it is already the sum of the elements in `a`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the variables mentioned.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is the computed sums for each iteration of the loop.**
