In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `input()`. Since the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to run.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. The loop head only includes the variable `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and the `range(int(input()))` expression.
3. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(0)` would result in no iterations.

Given the constraints that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, we know that `t` is already within a valid range for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself since it is already guaranteed to be a positive integer within the specified bounds.

However, since the task specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head only involves `t` indirectly through `input()`, we can state that the input should provide a valid `t`.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the input provides a valid `t` such that the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
