The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `sums`, we will denote it as `sums` in the output state. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sums]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
