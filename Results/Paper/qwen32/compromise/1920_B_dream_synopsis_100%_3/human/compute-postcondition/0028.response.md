Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and, depending on the condition, either the newly appended `sums` or `sums + a[0]`; `i` is incremented by 1 if the condition `i + x - 1 < n` is true, otherwise `i` is set to 2; `sums` is recalculated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if the condition is true, otherwise `sums` is `sums + a[0]`. If `i` was initially 0, `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `ans` includes this new `sums`. Otherwise, `sums` is adjusted based on the condition involving `i` and `x`, and `ans` includes either the new `sums` or `sums + a[0]`.**
