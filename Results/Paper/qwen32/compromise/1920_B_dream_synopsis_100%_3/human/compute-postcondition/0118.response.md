To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses and updates the variables involved.

### Loop Analysis
The loop runs for `k + 1` iterations. Here's a breakdown of what happens in each iteration:

1. **Initialization (i = 0)**:
   - `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
   - This value is appended to the `ans` list.

2. **Subsequent Iterations (i > 0)**:
   - If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
   - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
   - The updated `sums` is appended to the `ans` list.

### Final Output State
After `k + 1` iterations, the `ans` list will contain `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration.

### Calculation of the Final State
Let's summarize the final state of the variables:
- `t`: Remains unchanged.
- `n`: Remains unchanged.
- `k`: Remains unchanged.
- `x`: Remains unchanged.
- `a`: Remains unchanged.
- `sum1`: Remains unchanged.
- `ans`: A list of `k + 1` elements where each element is the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.

### Natural Language Description
The final output state is such that the variable `ans` contains `k + 1` elements. The first element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Each subsequent element is derived by updating the previous `sums` value according to the rules specified in the loop: either adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or simply adding `a[i - 1]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`.

### Final Output State Format
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.**
