Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`; `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Explanation: The value of `sums` is recalculated to be `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. All other variables retain their initial values or states.
