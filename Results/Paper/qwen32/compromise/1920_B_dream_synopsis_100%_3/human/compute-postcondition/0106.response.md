The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is the last element in `ans` before the append operation, after appending, `ans` will contain two identical elements, both equal to `sums`.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `ans` now contains an additional element which is the same as the existing element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
