The code snippet `a.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `a`. This affects the list `a` directly, but does not change the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `ans`). Since `a` was initially a sorted list of integers, after reversing, `a` will be the same list but in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is the computed sums for each iteration of the loop.**
