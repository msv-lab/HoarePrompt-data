Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing three elements. If `i` was initially 0, the first two elements of `ans` are `sum1` and the third element is `sums` updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, the first two elements of `ans` are the initial value of `sums` and the third element is the updated value of `sums` which is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
