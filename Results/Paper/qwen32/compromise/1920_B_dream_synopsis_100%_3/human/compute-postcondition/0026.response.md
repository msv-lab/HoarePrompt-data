The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Therefore, `ans` now contains two elements: the original value of `sums` and the updated value of `sums` (which is `sums + a[0]`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the values [original `sums`, `sums + a[0]`]; `i` is 2; `sums` is `sums + a[0]`.**
