The given code snippet appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is the last element of `ans` before the append operation, after appending, `ans` will contain two identical elements at the end.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
