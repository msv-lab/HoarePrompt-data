The code calculates `sums` by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a` from `sum1`. Since `a` is already sorted in descending order, the first `x` elements are the largest `x` elements of the list.

Given the initial state, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `a[:x]` represents the first `x` elements of `a`.

The new variable `sums` is calculated as:
\[ \text{sums} = \text{sum1} - 2 \times \sum(\text{a}[:\text{x}]) \]

No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` is an integer such that k ≥ 0, `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
