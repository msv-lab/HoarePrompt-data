Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and the newly appended value of `sums`; `i` is incremented by 1; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `sums`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
