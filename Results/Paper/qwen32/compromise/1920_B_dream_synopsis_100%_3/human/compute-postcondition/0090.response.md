The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Given the initial state, `sums` is already defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. After executing the line `ans.append(sums)`, the list `ans` will contain `sums` as its first (and currently only) element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`; `i` is 0; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
