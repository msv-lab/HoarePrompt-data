### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not handle the overlap of fireworks correctly and therefore does not compute the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. The function summary and the original assessment both point out that the current implementation simply adds the number of fireworks from each installation and adds 2, which is not the correct logic.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the overlap of fireworks from both installations. The key steps involve:

1. **Counting the number of fireworks from each installation within the visibility period**: This is given by `m // a + 1` and `m // b + 1`.
2. **Considering the overlap**: The overlap occurs when the visibility periods of fireworks from both installations intersect. This requires finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when fireworks from both installations are visible at the same time. The number of overlapping fireworks within the visibility period is given by `m // lcm(a, b) + 1`.

The correct formula to compute the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is:

\[ \text{max\_fireworks} = \left(\frac{m}{a} + 1\right) + \left(\frac{m}{b} + 1\right) - \left(\frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} + 1\right) \]

The provided code does not include this overlap calculation and incorrectly adds 2 instead of subtracting the overlap.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate as the provided program does not correctly handle the overlap of fireworks and thus does not compute the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
