Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is either 0 or the total number of iterations the loop ran, `i` is `i + 1`. If `num2` is greater than 10000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `op` is the total number of iterations the loop ran, `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median > median`, where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the last increment, and `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is greater than `median`.**
