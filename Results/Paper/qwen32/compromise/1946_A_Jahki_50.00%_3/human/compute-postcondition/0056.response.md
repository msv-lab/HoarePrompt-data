To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `new_median <= median`.

From the problem statement:
- `median` is `b[ma]` before increment.
- `new_median` is `b[ma]` after increment.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `new_median <= median` must be true. However, since `new_median` is `b[ma]` incremented by 1, and `median` is `b[ma]` before the increment, `new_median` will always be greater than `median` after the increment. Therefore, to satisfy the condition `new_median <= median`, we need to adjust the states such that the condition holds true.

Given this, the only way to ensure that `new_median <= median` is to adjust `new_median` or `median` directly. Since `new_median` is derived from `median` by incrementing `b[ma]`, the only feasible adjustment is to change `median` to be greater than `new_median` after the increment, which means adjusting `median` to be less than or equal to its current value minus 1.

Thus, we need to adjust `median` to be less than `new_median` before the increment, which means setting `median` to be less than `b[ma]` before the increment.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` must be less than `b[ma]` before increment, `new_median` is `b[ma]` after increment**
