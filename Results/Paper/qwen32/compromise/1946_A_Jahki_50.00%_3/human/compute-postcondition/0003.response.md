The code snippet provided only includes an input statement, which assigns the input value to the variable `case`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`) are modified by this code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `num` must be greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string.**
