Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the `case` string, `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer such that `ma` is a valid index in `b`, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 1`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the variable `op` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
