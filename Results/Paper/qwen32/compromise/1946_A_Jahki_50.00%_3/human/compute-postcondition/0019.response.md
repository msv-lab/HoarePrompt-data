To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `new_median <= median`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`
- `num` is greater than 0
- `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0
- `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a`
- `ma` is calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `(num2 - 1) // 2` if `num2` is odd
- `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`
- `new_median` is equal to `median`

The loop condition `new_median <= median` will always be true because `new_median` is initialized to `median`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to make the loop execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a`, `ma` is calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `(num2 - 1) // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, `new_median` is equal to `median`**
