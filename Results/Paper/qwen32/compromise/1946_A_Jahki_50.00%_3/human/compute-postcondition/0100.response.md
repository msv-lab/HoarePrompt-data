Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`. If `num2` is greater than 10000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `a` is derived from the digits in the `case` string, `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by `k` (where `k` is the smallest integer such that `b[ma] + k > median`), `op` is `k`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, and `new_median` is `b[ma] + k`.**
