The given code snippet assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Since `b[ma]` is already defined as the median value of the list `b` after incrementing the element at index `ma`, the value of `new_median` will be the same as `b[ma]`.

Therefore, the value of `new_median` is updated to be equal to `b[ma]`, which is the incremented median value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is `b[ma]` before increment, `new_median` is `b[ma]` after increment**.
