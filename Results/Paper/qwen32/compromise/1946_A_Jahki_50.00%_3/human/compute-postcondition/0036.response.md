Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, and `op` is 0. If `num2` is greater than 10000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `a` is transformed into a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `op` is the number of increments needed to make `b[ma]` greater than the original median, `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with the element at index `ma` incremented to `median_original + 1`, `ma` is calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `(num2 - 1) // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the original sorted list `b`, and `new_median` is `median_original + 1`.**
