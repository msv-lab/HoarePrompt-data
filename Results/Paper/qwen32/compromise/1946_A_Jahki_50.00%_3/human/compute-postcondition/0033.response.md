The given Python code snippet updates the value of `new_median`. Initially, `new_median` is set to `b[ma] - 1`. However, the code changes this to simply `b[ma]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 3, `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with the element at index `ma` incremented by 3, `ma` is calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `(num2 - 1) // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is `b[ma] - 3`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `new_median` has been updated to be the same as `b[ma]`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
