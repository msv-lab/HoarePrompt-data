Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`num`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`num2`) and the array elements (`case`).

2. **Handling Large Inputs:**
   - There's a conditional check `if num2 > 10000:` which is not part of the problem constraints. This seems like an unnecessary optimization or a mistake since the problem states `n â‰¤ 10^5`. This check and the subsequent `print` statements will cause incorrect results for arrays with sizes greater than 10000.

3. **Parsing and Sorting:**
   - The array elements are parsed into integers and stored in list `a`.
   - The list `a` is then sorted to get list `b`.

4. **Finding Median:**
   - The median index `ma` is calculated correctly based on whether `num2` is even or odd.
   - The current median (`median`) is set to the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.

5. **Increasing the Median:**
   - The program enters a loop where it increments the element at index `ma` in `b` until the new median is greater than the old median.
   - After each increment, the list `b` is re-sorted to find the new median.
   - The number of operations (`op`) is incremented each time the median is increased.

6. **Output:**
   - The number of operations required to increase the median is printed for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Handling of Large Inputs:** The conditional check `if num2 > 10000:` is incorrect and will lead to wrong outputs for valid inputs.
- **Inefficient Sorting:** Re-sorting the entire list after each increment is inefficient. A more efficient approach would involve maintaining a heap or using a selection algorithm to find the median without sorting the entire list multiple times.
- **Logic Error:** The logic for increasing the median is correct, but the inefficiency and incorrect handling of large inputs make the program incorrect overall.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect handling of large inputs and inefficient sorting, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
