### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The key observation here is that the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes. Therefore, the side length of the square can be determined by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, as they will yield the same result for a square).

The provided program correctly implements this logic. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of one corner of the square. These coordinates are stored in a list `a` of lists.

2. **Extracting x-coordinates:**
   - The program extracts the x-coordinates from the list of coordinates into a separate list `x`.

3. **Calculating Side Length:**
   - The side length of the square is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`max(x) - min(x)`).

4. **Calculating Area:**
   - The area of the square is then calculated as the square of the side length (`dx * dx`).

5. **Output:**
   - The area of the square is printed for each test case.

The program assumes that the input guarantees the points form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it correctly computes the area based on this assumption.

### Correctness:
The program correctly calculates the area of the square for each test case based on the given input format and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
