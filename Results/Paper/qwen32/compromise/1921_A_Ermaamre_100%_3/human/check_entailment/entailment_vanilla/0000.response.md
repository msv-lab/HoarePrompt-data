### Reasoning:
The given problem requires us to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The key observation is that the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, which simplifies the problem significantly. 

For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, as they will give the same result). This is because the side length of the square will be the distance between the farthest x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) since the sides are parallel to the axes.

The provided program correctly follows this approach:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
3. It extracts the x-coordinates from these points.
4. It calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.
5. It prints the area of the square, which is the side length squared.

Let's verify this with the provided example:

**Example Input:**
```
3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
4
784
```

**Program Output:**
- For the first square, the x-coordinates are [1, 4, 1, 4]. The side length is `max(x) - min(x) = 4 - 1 = 3`. The area is `3 * 3 = 9`.
- For the second square, the x-coordinates are [-1, 1, 1, -1]. The side length is `max(x) - min(x) = 1 - (-1) = 2`. The area is `2 * 2 = 4`.
- For the third square, the x-coordinates are [45, 45, 17, 17]. The side length is `max(x) - min(x) = 45 - 17 = 28`. The area is `28 * 28 = 784`.

The program correctly computes the area for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the area of the square given its corner coordinates.

**Correctness: True**
