You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
    return res



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns the count of unique numbers in the list `a` that were not previously encountered when they were first seen.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to divide non-negative integers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share any matching bits in their binary representations from the 1st to the 31st bit. The goal is to find the minimum number of groups required.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a dictionary `count` to track the numbers. However, the logic in the program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of numbers `a`.
3. It calls `func_1(n, a)` to determine the minimum number of groups.
4. `func_1` initializes `res` (the result) to 0 and an empty dictionary `count`.
5. For each number `num` in the list `a`:
   - It checks if `num` is not in `count`.
   - If `num` is not in `count`, it increments the count of `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` (which is the bitwise NOT of `num` within the 31 bits) and increments `res`.
   - If `num` is in `count`, it decrements the count of `num`.
6. Finally, it returns `res`.

### Issues with the Program
The program's logic is flawed for several reasons:
- The use of bitwise NOT (`num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`) is not appropriate for the problem. The problem requires checking the bits of the numbers directly, not their bitwise NOT.
- The program does not correctly track the groups or ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.
- The decrement operation on `count[num]` when `num` is found in `count` does not logically fit the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, one approach is to use a bit manipulation technique to determine the minimum number of groups. Specifically, we can use a bitmask to track which bits are used in the current group. Here’s a correct approach:
- For each number, determine the bits that are set.
- Use a greedy algorithm to assign numbers to groups based on the bits they have. If a number cannot be added to any existing group (i.e., it shares bits with all existing groups), create a new group.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
