To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
Let's break down the program and see if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes `ans` to `n`. This is likely an attempt to account for pairs where `b=1`, since for any `a`, `a + 1` is always a multiple of `1 * gcd(a, 1) = 1`.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of `b`:**
   - The loop iterates from `b=2` to `min(n, m)`.
   - For each `b`, it increments `ans` by `(n + b) // (b * b)`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Issues in the Program:
The logic `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs for each `b`. Here's why:

- The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is more complex than what the current formula accounts for.
- The program does not correctly iterate over all possible values of `a` for each `b` to check the condition.
- The formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` seems to be an incorrect simplification or approximation of the problem.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective bounds and checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, this naive approach would be too slow given the constraints (\(n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)).

Instead, optimizations involving mathematical properties or precomputation might be necessary, but the provided code does not implement such optimizations correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
