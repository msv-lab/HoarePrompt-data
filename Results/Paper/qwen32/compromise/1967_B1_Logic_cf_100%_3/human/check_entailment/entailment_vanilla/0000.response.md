Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Analysis of the Given Program:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\). It initializes `ans` to \(n\) and then iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\). For each \(b\), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`. Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The program initializes `ans` to \(n\). This is incorrect because it does not account for the pairs where \(b = 1\). For \(b = 1\), the condition simplifies to checking if \(a + 1\) is a multiple of 1, which is always true. Therefore, there are \(n\) valid pairs when \(b = 1\).

2. **Condition Check:** The program uses \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to count the valid pairs for each \(b\). However, this formula does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of \(a\) and checking the condition directly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we should iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), iterate over possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\). For each pair \((a, b)\), check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
