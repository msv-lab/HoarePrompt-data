To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet in the context of the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is equal to `n`.
- `T` is `T + 1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
```

The code modifies the value of `ans`. Here's the updated value of `ans`:

- The new value of `ans` is calculated as `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`.
- Since `ans` was initially `n`, the new value of `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`.

Note that `b` is not defined in the initial state, so we'll keep it as `b` in our expression.

The other variables (`t`, `m`, and `T`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is `T + 1`.**
