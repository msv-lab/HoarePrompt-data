The given code snippet sets the variable `ans` to the value of `n`. This means that the previous value of `ans` is overwritten by the value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer representing the first number from the input, `m` is an integer representing the second number from the input, `ans` is equal to `n`, `T` is `T + 1`.**

In natural language, this means that `ans` now holds the same value as `n`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
