To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. The loop iterates over `b` starting from 2 up to `min(n, m)` inclusive.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is equal to `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`.

From the loop statement:
```
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know that `b` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `b` was some value `k` where `2 <= k < min(n, m)`. At the start of the next iteration, `b` will be `k + 1`.

Since `n` and `m` do not change within the loop, their values remain the same. The value of `ans` is recalculated in each iteration based on the new value of `b`, but since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration and not recalculating `ans`, we do not need to change its value in the state description.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`**.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
