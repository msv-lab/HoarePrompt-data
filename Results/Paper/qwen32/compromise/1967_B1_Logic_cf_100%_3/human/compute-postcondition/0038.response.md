Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer. For each iteration, `n` and `m` are read as integers from the input, and `ans` is calculated as `n + Î£((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`. After each iteration, the result `ans` is printed.**

In simpler terms, the loop runs `t` times. In each run, it reads two numbers `n` and `m`, computes the value of `ans` using the given formula, and prints `ans`. This process repeats until all `t` iterations are completed.
