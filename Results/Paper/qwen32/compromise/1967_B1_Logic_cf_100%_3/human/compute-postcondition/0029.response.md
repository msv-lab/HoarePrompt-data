To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `b` and the range parameters `2`, `min(n, m) + 1`.

Given the loop:
```python
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `b` starts from 2 and goes up to `min(n, m) + 1`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `min(n, m) + 1` must be greater than 2. This implies that `min(n, m)` must be at least 2.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `n` and `m` should both be at least 2 to ensure that `min(n, m)` is at least 2, making the range non-empty and allowing the loop to execute.
- `b` does not need to be explicitly set before the loop because it is initialized by the `range` function.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is `n`, `T` is `T + 1`**
