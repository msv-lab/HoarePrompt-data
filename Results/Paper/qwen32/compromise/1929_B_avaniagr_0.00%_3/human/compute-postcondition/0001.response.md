To determine the output state after executing the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the code inside the loop. The loop processes each line of input, which contains two integers `n` and `k`, and computes a value based on these integers.

Here's the code inside the loop:
```python
print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```

Let's break down the expression:
- `(k // 2 + k % 2)` computes the ceiling of `k / 2`. This is because `k // 2` is the integer division of `k` by 2, and `k % 2` adds 1 if `k` is odd.
- `(k < 4 * n - 3)` evaluates to 1 if true, 0 if false.
- `(k >= 4 * n - 3)` evaluates to 1 if true, 0 if false.
- `(k == 4 * n - 2)` evaluates to 1 if true, 0 if false.

The expression can be interpreted as follows:
- If `k < 4 * n - 3`, the output is the ceiling of `k / 2`.
- If `k == 4 * n - 3`, the output is `2 * n`.
- If `k == 4 * n - 2`, the output is `2 * n + 1`.
- If `k > 4 * n - 3`, the output is `2 * n`.

Given the constraints, the output for each pair `(n, k)` will be one of these values.

The output state will be a series of integers, each corresponding to the result of the expression for each pair `(n, k)` in the input.

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the computed value for each pair (n, k) from the input.**
