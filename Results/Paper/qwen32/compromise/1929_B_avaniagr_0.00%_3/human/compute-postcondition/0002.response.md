Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each of the next `t` lines, it receives two integers `n` and `k` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k` for each test case.**
