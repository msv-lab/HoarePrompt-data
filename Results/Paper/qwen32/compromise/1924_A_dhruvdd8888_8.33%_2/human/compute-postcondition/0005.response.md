The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ps` to 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; the string `s` is the input string of length `m` and consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list; `ps` is 0.**
