### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly address the problem statement. The task is to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. If not, the program should output one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not attempt to check all possible strings of length `n`. Instead, it seems to be trying to find sequences of `k` distinct characters in `s` and then checking if the count of such sequences is at least `n`. This approach is not aligned with the problem requirements.

Here are the key issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The code attempts to find sequences of `k` distinct characters in `s` and checks if there are enough such sequences to match `n`. This does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` are checked as subsequences.

2. **Output for NO Case**: The code prints a string that is not guaranteed to be a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`. It simply appends characters from `us` and pads with 'a', which may not be a valid counterexample.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic for constructing a string that does not occur as a subsequence is flawed. It does not consider all possible combinations of length `n` and does not verify if the constructed string is indeed not a subsequence of `s`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. A correct solution would involve generating all possible strings of length `n` from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and checking if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not found, that string should be output as the counterexample.
