Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `S` is a list of length `n+1` where the last element is a list containing the count of '0's and '1's in another list `a`.
- `ans` is initialized to 0.
- `satisfy` is initialized to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is explicitly initialized to 0 in the initial state.
- The `print` statement will output the value of `ans`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `ans` is explicitly set to 0, the output of the `print` statement will be the integer 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
