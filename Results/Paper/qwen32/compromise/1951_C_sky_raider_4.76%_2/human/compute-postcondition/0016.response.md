The code snippet `k -= s` means that the value of `k` is decreased by the value of `s`. Given that `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, the value of `k` will be reduced by this minimum value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is `k - s`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` has been reduced by the smaller of its original value and `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
