The code snippet assigns the variable `s` the minimum value between `m` and `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is min(m, k), `c` is `k * k / 2`.**
