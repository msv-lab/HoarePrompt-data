To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This represents the number of test cases or iterations.
- `n` is the first integer from the input, which likely indicates the number of elements in the list `l`.
- `m` is the second integer from the input, which could represent a limit or a threshold value.
- `k` is the remaining value after all iterations, but its specific role isn't described clearly in the initial state.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `s` is the value of `s` in the last iteration, but its specific role isn't described clearly in the initial state.
- `c` is the cumulative value after all iterations.
- `i` is initialized to `n`.

Given this information, the key variable we need to focus on is `c`, which is described as the cumulative value after all iterations. Since the exact operations that modify `c` are not provided, we can only infer that `c` is some accumulated result from processing the list `l` and possibly other inputs.

Without the specific logic that modifies `c`, we can only describe it as the cumulative value after all iterations. Therefore, the output will be the integer value of `c`.

Output: **c (where c is the cumulative value after all iterations)**
