The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. This means that `l` will now hold the new list of integers provided in the input, replacing its previous value.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is the value of `s` in the last iteration, `c` is the cumulative value after all iterations, `i` is 0**.
