The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again, so `i` becomes `i + 2`.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 2` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the smaller of `m` and `k`, `i` is `i + 2`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`**
