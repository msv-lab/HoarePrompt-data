Let's break down the loop to understand the transformation of the initial state to the final state.

The initial state includes:
- `n`: an integer value obtained from user input (though `n` is not used in the loop, so it remains unchanged).
- `a`: a string input from the user.
- `S`: a list initialized with `[[0, 0]]`.

The loop iterates over each character in the string `a`. For each character, it checks if the character is '0' or not:
- If the character is '0', it increments the first element of the last sublist in `S` by 1.
- If the character is not '0', it increments the second element of the last sublist in `S` by 1.

After each iteration, a new sublist with the updated values is appended to `S`.

Let's assume the string `a` contains `m` characters. The final state of `S` will be a list with `m + 1` sublists (since we start with `[[0, 0]]` and append a new sublist for each character in `a`).

The final sublist in `S` will contain the count of '0's and non-'0's in the string `a` respectively. Specifically, the first element of the last sublist will be the count of '0's in `a`, and the second element will be the count of non-'0's in `a`.

For example, if the string `a` is "01010", the final state of `S` will be `[[0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 2]]`.

Thus, the output state in the required format is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value obtained from user input, `a` is the string input from the user, `S` is `[[0, 0], [count of '0's after first character, count of non-'0's after first character], ..., [final count of '0's, final count of non-'0's]]`.**
