In this task, the for loop depends on the value obtained from `int(input())`. Since there are no variables in the function signature that can be directly adjusted, the only thing we can control is the input to the `input()` function, which will then be converted to an integer and used to determine the number of iterations of the loop.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer.**
