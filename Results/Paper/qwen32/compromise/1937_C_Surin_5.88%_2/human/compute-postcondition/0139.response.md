The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer to ensure that all output is written to the standard output immediately. However, this operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `v2`, `r`, `prev`, `v1`) are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is n-1, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the newly read input from the current iteration. If `r` equals '>', `prev` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0. `v1` is the largest index j for which the input `r` was '<'.**
