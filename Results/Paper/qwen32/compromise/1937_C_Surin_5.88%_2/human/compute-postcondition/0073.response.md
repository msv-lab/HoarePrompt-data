To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer read from the input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, ..., n-1\}\).
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is set to `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0.
- `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`.
- `kp` is incremented by 1 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `kp` remains unchanged.
- `v2` is initialized to 4.
- `r` is the newly input string.
- `i` is initialized to 4.

### Analysis of Variables:
- `v1`: According to the description, `v1` is set to `i` if `r` is `'<'`. Since the value of `r` is not specified, we assume it is not `'<'` (otherwise, `v1` would be 4). Therefore, `v1` remains 0.
- `v2`: `v2` is explicitly set to 4.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Given the values of `v1` and `v2`:
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is 4.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output:
Output: **? 0 0 4 4**
