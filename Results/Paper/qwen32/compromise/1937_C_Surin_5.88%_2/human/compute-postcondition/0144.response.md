To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable represents the number of test cases but does not affect the current print statement directly.
   - `n`: A newly read integer from the input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - `i`: Defined as `n - 2`.
   - `v2`: Defined as `n - 1`.
   - `r`: The newly read input from the current iteration, which can either be '>' or '<'.
   - `prev`: Set to `n - 1` if `r` equals '>', otherwise set to 0.
   - `v1`: The largest index \(j\) for which the input `r` was '<'. Since the problem doesn't specify any previous iterations or inputs, we assume `v1` is determined based on the current context. Given the lack of specific context, we'll assume `v1` is initialized to 0 unless specified otherwise in the problem constraints.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`

Given the definitions and the lack of specific values for `r` and previous iterations, we can infer the following:
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `v1` is assumed to be 0 unless specified otherwise.
- `prev` is `n - 1` if `r` is '>', otherwise it is 0.

Let's consider both scenarios for `r`:
- If `r` is '>', then `prev` is `n - 1`.
- If `r` is '<', then `prev` is 0.

Since the problem doesn't specify the value of `r`, we need to account for both possibilities. However, without loss of generality, we can describe the output in terms of these possibilities.

### Output Scenarios:
1. **If `r` is '>':**
   - `prev` = `n - 1`
   - Output: `? 0 {n-2} 0 {n-1}`

2. **If `r` is '<':**
   - `prev` = 0
   - Output: `? 0 {n-2} 0 0`

Since we don't have a specific value for `r`, we can provide the output in terms of the possible values of `prev`.

### Final Output Description:
The print statement will output a formatted string with `v1` as 0, `i` as `n-2`, and `prev` as either `n-1` if `r` is '>', or 0 if `r` is '<'.

Output: **? 0 {n-2} 0 {prev} (where prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise 0)**
