The given Python code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `r`, `i`) are modified by the `sys.stdout.flush()` command. Therefore, the output state remains identical to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`, `prev` is 4 if `r` was `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `r` is the newly input string, `i` is 5**.
