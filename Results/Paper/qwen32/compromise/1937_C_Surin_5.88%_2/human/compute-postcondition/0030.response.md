To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the variables `i` and `n` are the ones we can adjust.

### Analysis:
- **`i`**: This variable is initialized to 1 and will increment by 1 until it reaches `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.
- **`n`**: This variable is already given as an integer read from the input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\). Since this condition is already satisfied (as per the problem statement), no adjustment is needed for `n`.

### Conclusion:
The only variable in the loop head that needs to be considered for the loop to execute is `i`. However, since `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop head itself, there's no need to adjust its value before the loop starts. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1, which is already ensured by the problem statement.

Therefore, the state remains as provided, with the understanding that the loop will execute because `n` is within the required range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`, `prev` is 0**
