The code snippet provided is `v1 = v2`. This means the value of `v2` is being assigned to `v1`.

Given the Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴
- The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0
- `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`
- `kp` is incremented by 1 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `kp` remains unchanged
- `v2` is `i`
- `r` is the newly input string
- `i` is incremented by 1

After executing `v1 = v2`, the value of `v1` is now equal to the value of `v2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`, `kp` is incremented by 1 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `kp` remains unchanged, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the newly input string, `i` is incremented by 1**.
