The code assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Since `v2` is initially 1, `v1` will also become 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is the newly read input and `r` equals '<', `v1` is 1**.
