To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (This variable does not directly influence the print statement).
- `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴ (This variable also does not directly influence the print statement).
- The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} (This sequence is not directly used in the print statement).
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers (This function is not used in the print statement).
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it (This function is not used in the print statement).
- `g` is initialized to 0 (This variable is not used in the print statement).
- `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`.
- `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

We need to determine the values of `prev` and `v1` based on the initial state description. Since the exact values of `prev` and `v1` depend on the input `r` which is not provided, we can only describe them based on their definitions:

- `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`.
- `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`.

Thus, the output will be the formatted string with these values.

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where prev is the largest index i for which the input r was '>', and v1 is the largest index i for which the input r was '<')**
