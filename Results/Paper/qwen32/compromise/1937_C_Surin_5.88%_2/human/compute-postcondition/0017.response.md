The provided Python code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the console. However, this operation does not affect any of the variables in the given initial state.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, `I`, `R`, `i`, `v2`) are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `i` is 4, `v2` is 4.**
