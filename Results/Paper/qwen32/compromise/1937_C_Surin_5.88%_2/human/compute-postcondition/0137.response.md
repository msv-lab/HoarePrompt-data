To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.

Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, it means that the loop condition `i < n` is no longer satisfied, and the loop would terminate if we did not adjust the state.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `i` so that it is less than `n`. The natural progression in a `for` loop is to increment `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 1`.

The variable `n` does not need adjustment because it defines the upper bound of the loop and is not modified within the loop head.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is n-1, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the newly read input from the current iteration. If `r` equals '>', `prev` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0. `v1` is the largest index j for which the input `r` was '<'.**

Note: The values of `t`, `v2`, `r`, `prev`, and `v1` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not specified to change based on the loop iteration.
