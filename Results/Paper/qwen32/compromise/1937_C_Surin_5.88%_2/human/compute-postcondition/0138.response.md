Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴.
- `i` is initialized to `n-1`.
- `v2` is also initialized to `n-1`.
- `r` is the newly read input from the current iteration.
  - If `r` equals '>', `prev` is set to `n`.
  - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.
- `v1` is the largest index `j` for which the input `r` was '<'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: 
   - `i` is explicitly set to `n-1`.

2. **Value of `v1`**:
   - `v1` is described as the largest index `j` for which the input `r` was '<'. Since no specific iterations or inputs are given, `v1` could be any value from 0 to `n-1` depending on the sequence of inputs. However, without specific input data, we can only say it is the largest index where `r` was '<'.

3. **Value of `prev`**:
   - `prev` is set to `n` if `r` is '>', otherwise it remains 0. Again, without knowing the specific value of `r`, we can only say that `prev` is either `n` or 0.

4. **Formatted String**:
   - The print statement constructs a string in the format `'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}'`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the lack of specific input values, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? [v1] [n-1] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the largest index j for which r was '<', n is the newly read integer from the input, and prev is n if r is '>', otherwise 0)**
