The code assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Given that `i` is 3, `v2` will now be 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is the newly read input. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `v1` remains unchanged.**
