The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `v1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10⁴, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0.**
