### Reasoning:

The provided code aims to solve the problem of counting the number of initial arrays `a` such that the sorted prefix sums of `a` match the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Here's a detailed analysis of the approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The code uses dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the number of ways to achieve each possible prefix sum at each step.
   - `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `j - n` after considering some elements of `a`.
   - The `offset` variable is used to shift the range of possible prefix sums from `[-n, n]` to `[0, 2n]` to avoid negative indices.

2. **Transition**:
   - For each element in `a`, the prefix sum can either increase by 1 (if the element is 1) or decrease by 1 (if the element is -1).
   - The DP table is updated accordingly: `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` are incremented based on the current state `dp[j]`.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the final answer is the number of ways to achieve the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p`, which is stored in `dp[p[-1] + n]`.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo `998244353`.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is read in one go and parsed into individual test cases.
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` is called with the appropriate parameters, and the results are collected and printed.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Initialization**: The DP table is initialized correctly with `dp[n] = 1`, indicating one way to achieve a prefix sum of 0 (by having an empty prefix).
- **Transition Logic**: The transition logic correctly accounts for both possible increments (+1 and -1) in the prefix sum.
- **Final Result**: The final result is correctly extracted from the DP table based on the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p`.
- **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation ensures that the results remain within the required range.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the intended algorithm to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the logic aligns with the problem description.
