You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the number of possible arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that when the prefix sums of `a` are calculated and sorted, they match the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The result should be given modulo `998,244,353`.

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum `p_i` is calculated as the cumulative sum of elements from `a_1` to `a_i`.
2. **Sorting**: After calculating the prefix sums, they are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum at each step.
4. **Offset Handling**: Since prefix sums can be negative, an offset (`n`) is used to map these values to indices in the `dp` array.
5. **Modulo Operation**: All operations are performed modulo `998,244,353` to handle large numbers.

### Detailed Reasoning

- **Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with a size of `2*n + 1` to accommodate all possible prefix sums (from `-n` to `n`). The offset `n` is used to shift these values to non-negative indices.
- **Transition**: For each element in `a`, the current state of the `dp` array is updated based on the previous state. If the current prefix sum is `j`, the next prefix sum can either be `j+1` (if the current element in `a` is `1`) or `j-1` (if the current element in `a` is `-1`).
- **Final State**: After processing all elements, the value at the index corresponding to the final prefix sum in `p` (adjusted by the offset) gives the number of valid arrays `a`.

### Checking the Code

Let's verify if the code correctly implements the above logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
   offset = n
   dp[offset] = 1
   ```
   This correctly initializes the `dp` array with an offset to handle negative prefix sums.

2. **Transition**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
       for j in range(2 * n + 1):
           if dp[j] > 0:
               if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                   new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
               if j - 1 >= 0:
                   new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
       dp = new_dp
   ```
   This correctly updates the `dp` array for each element in `a`.

3. **Result Extraction**:
   ```python
   final_sum = p[-1] + offset
   return dp[final_sum]
   ```
   This correctly extracts the result from the `dp` array using the final prefix sum adjusted by the offset.

### Conclusion

The code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases, including negative prefix sums, and performs all operations modulo `998,244,353`.
