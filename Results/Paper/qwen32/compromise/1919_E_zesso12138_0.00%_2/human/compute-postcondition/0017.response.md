Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `index` is updated to `3 + 2*n`. All other variables retain their original values as specified in the initial state.
