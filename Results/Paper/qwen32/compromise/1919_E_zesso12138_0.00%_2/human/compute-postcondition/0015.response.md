Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `3 + n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**

Natural Language: The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, making it `3 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
