The code assigns the value of `p[-1] + offset` to the variable `final_sum`. Given that `p` is a list of integers of length `n` and `offset` is `n`, the value of `final_sum` will be the last element of `p` plus `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1); `p` is a list of integers of length `n`; `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where each element `dp[j]` is the binomial coefficient `C(n, j-n) % MOD`; `offset` is `n`; `i` is `n + 1`; `final_sum` is `p[-1] + n`.**
