Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1); `p` is a list of integers of length `n`; `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1`; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1`. If `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. `i` is 3; `j` is 2. If `j + 1` is not less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp` remains unchanged.**
