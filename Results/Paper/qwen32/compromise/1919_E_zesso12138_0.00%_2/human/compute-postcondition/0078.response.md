Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1); `p` is a list of integers of length `n`; `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where each element `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of `dp[k]` for `k` such that `k + 1 = j` or `k - 1 = j`, all taken modulo `MOD`; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1`; `i` is 3; `j` is `2 * n`.**

Explanation: The value of `dp` is updated to be equal to `new_dp`. All other variables retain their initial values.
