The code appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified. The value of `result` is the return value of the function `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace, `index` is `2 + n`, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `result`, `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
