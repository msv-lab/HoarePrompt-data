The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means `n` will now hold the value of the integer input. The other variables (`t` and `a`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
