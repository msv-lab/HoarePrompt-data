Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing a series of operations where each operation can change a subarray to its MEX (minimum excluded value). The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. We need to output the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to handle subarrays and seems to attempt to fill subarrays with their MEX.
   - The function is recursive and calls itself with `l + 1` to process the subarray starting from the next element.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if the element is not zero and sets it to zero, appending the operation.
   - If `l != r`, it recursively processes the subarray and then checks if the MEX of the current subarray (which is `r - l + 1`) is different from the current elements. If so, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation.
   - This approach seems flawed because setting all elements to `r - l + 1` might not always maximize the sum correctly, and the MEX calculation seems incorrect.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - However, `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within the scope of `func_2`, leading to a `NameError`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function is supposed to maximize the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
   - It checks if the current sum `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If so, it calls `func_1` and then sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - If the sum is already greater than this value, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum element.
   - The logic here is flawed because it doesn't correctly compute the MEX and apply it to maximize the sum.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and then prints the results.
   - The issue with `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` would cause this function to not work correctly.

### Conclusion
The provided code has several issues:
- `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within the scope of `func_2`, leading to a runtime error.
- The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is not correctly implemented to achieve the goal of maximizing the sum using the MEX operation.
- The approach of setting all elements to `r - l + 1` is not always optimal for maximizing the sum.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Final: **False**
