Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a); `s` is the sum of `a[l:r + 1]` and is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1); `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. The current value of `pos` is not equal to `l`.**
