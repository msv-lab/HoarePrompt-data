You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c

    bb
    
    aa

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is the number of iterations, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the strings from the last iteration, `slength` is the integer input from the last iteration, and `no` is True if `c` is neither equal to `a` nor `b` and all characters in `c` are in `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `no` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it checks if a third string `c` is either equal to the first string `a` or the second string `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in either `a` or `b`. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if `c` meets one of these conditions, otherwise it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Here's a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2
aa
ab
ac
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For the template "Aa", both `a` ("aa") and `b` ("ab") match it because:
  - The first character 'A' in the template requires `a` and `b` to have different characters from 'a' (lowercase 'a'). Since `a` and `b` both have 'a' as the first character, this condition is not violated.
  - The second character 'a' in the template requires `a` and `b` to have the same character as 'a'. Both `a` and `b` have 'a' as the second character, so this condition is satisfied.
- The string `c` ("ac") does not match the template "Aa" because:
  - The second character 'a' in the template requires `c` to have the same character as 'a'. However, `c` has 'c' as the second character, which does not match 'a'.

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
- The provided program incorrectly prints "NO" for the above test case because it does not correctly implement the logic for checking whether a template exists that satisfies the conditions.

The program's logic is flawed in the following ways:
- It checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, which is not the correct condition for the problem.
- It checks if any character in `c` is not in `a` or `b`, which is also not the correct condition for the problem.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
