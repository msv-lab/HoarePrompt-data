Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a new input string, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the new input string, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, and `no` is True.
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a and x not in b:
        print('YES')
        no = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string that must have at least one character, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, and `no` is False if `x` is not an element of `a` and `x` is not an element of `b`. Otherwise, `no` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string that must have at least two characters, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, and `x` is the second character in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, then `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` and `b` are input strings, `c` is an input string with at least three characters, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, and `x` is the third character in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, then `no` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `no` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
