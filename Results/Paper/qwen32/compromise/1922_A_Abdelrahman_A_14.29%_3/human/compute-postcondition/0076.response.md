The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `tests`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `slength`), but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely dependent on the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `tests`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `slength`) are referenced in the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output will be the exact string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
