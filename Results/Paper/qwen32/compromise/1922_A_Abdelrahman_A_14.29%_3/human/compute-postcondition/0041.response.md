Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string that must have at least one character, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, and `no` is True. Additionally, `x` is not an element of `a` and `x` is not an element of `b`.**
