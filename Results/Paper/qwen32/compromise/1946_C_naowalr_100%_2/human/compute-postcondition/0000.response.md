In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the value read from standard input and converted to an integer. The loop will execute based on this integer value. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The loop head contains `_` and `range(int(sys.stdin.readline()))`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted.
2. The loop will execute if the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` is greater than 0.

Since no variables are present in the function signature for `func_1`, we only need to ensure that the input read from standard input is a positive integer.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` is greater than 0.

State: **The integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than 0**.
