Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not provide a valid partitioning strategy for all possible inputs. Specifically, the program fails to correctly identify when a string can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Handling of Strings with Repeated Characters:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if a string has repeated characters, it cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings. For example, the string "aaab" can be partitioned into "aa" and "ab", both of which are not palindromes.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Non-Palindrome Partitions:**
   - The logic used to identify non-palindrome partitions is flawed. For example, the program attempts to find a point where the string can be split into two non-palindrome substrings, but it does not correctly handle cases where more than two substrings are needed.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - The program does not correctly handle strings that are palindromes but can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings. For example, the string "abccba" can be partitioned into "abc" and "cba", both of which are not palindromes.

4. **Inefficient and Incorrect Partitioning Strategy:**
   - The program uses a flawed strategy to identify partition points, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program may incorrectly identify a partition point that results in a palindrome substring.

To correctly solve the problem, a more robust strategy is needed to identify valid partitions. One possible approach is to iteratively split the string into the smallest possible non-palindrome substrings. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        parts = []
        start = 0
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if not is_palindrome(string[start:j]):
                parts.append(string[start:j])
                start = j
        if start == n:
            print('YES')
            print(len(parts))
            print(' '.join(parts))
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected program checks each possible substring starting from the beginning of the string and adds it to the partition if it is not a palindrome. It continues this process until the entire string is partitioned or determines that no valid partition exists.
