Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is the first character of `string`; not all characters in `s` are equal to `x`. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, then if `n` is odd and the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` of `s` is not equal to `x`, `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is not equal to `x`. Otherwise, either `n` is even, or `n` is odd and the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` of `s` is equal to `x`. If `s.count(x) != n - 1`, the state of `done` remains unchanged.**
