Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
   - `string` is the input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1.
   - `x` is the first character of `string`.
   - `s.count(x) == n - 1`, meaning that the first character `x` appears `n - 1` times in the string.
   - Not all characters in `s` are equal to `x`.
   - `n` is odd.
   - `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is not equal to `x`, meaning the middle character of the list `s` is not the same as the first character `x`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, or any other conditions provided in the initial state.
   - The conditions given in the initial state are not used in the print statement itself, so they do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **NO**
