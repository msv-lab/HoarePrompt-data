To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the logic described for the variables involved.

### Initial State and Variables:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `string` is a newly input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1.
- `x` is the first character of the newly input string.
- `j` is initialized to 2.
- `count` is set to 1 if `s[j] != x` and `count` was less than 1, otherwise `count` remains unchanged.
- `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` equals `x` and `count` is greater than 0.
- `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False. If `count > 0`, then additional conditions are checked to set `done` to True based on the values of `count`, `count2`, and `s[j]`.

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('YES')` is executed regardless of the conditions described for `count`, `count2`, and `done`. The logic described for these variables affects whether `done` is set to True or not, but it does not influence the execution of the `print('YES')` statement. Therefore, the output will always be 'YES' as long as the code reaches this point.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
