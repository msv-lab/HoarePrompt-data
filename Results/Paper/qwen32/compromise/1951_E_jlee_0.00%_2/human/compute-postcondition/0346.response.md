Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count` is greater than 1, `count` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, `count2` is equal to `count`, and `done` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `count` is 1, `count2` is 0, and `done` is not set to `True`.**
