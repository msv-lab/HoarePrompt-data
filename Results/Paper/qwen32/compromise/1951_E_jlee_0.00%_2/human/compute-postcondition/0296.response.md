The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables directly. Therefore, none of the variables `string`, `n`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, `done`, `i`, or `s` are changed by this statement.

Output State: **`string` is the input string, `n` is the length of `string`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is the index of the first character not equal to `x` if such a character exists before the midpoint of the string, `count2` counts the number of characters equal to `x` after `count` up to the midpoint of the string, `done` is `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`.**
