To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions described.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `string` is the input string with at least 1 character.
3. `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character.
4. `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1.
5. `x` is the first character of `string`.
6. `j` is initialized to 2.
7. The code includes conditions involving `count`, `count2`, and `done`, but their initial values are not explicitly given. However, the print statement is outside any conditional blocks and will execute regardless of the values of these variables.

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement is not conditioned on any variable or calculation within the provided initial state.
- The statement will execute as long as the code reaches that point, which it will do regardless of the values of `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print('YES')` statement is not dependent on any variable or condition that might prevent its execution, it will execute and print "YES".

Output: **YES**
