Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `string` is the input string.
2. `n` is at least 1.
3. `j` is 0.
4. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. `x` is `s[0]`.
6. `i` is incremented by 1. (Note: This does not affect the print statement directly since `i` is not used in the print statement.)
7. The condition checks if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If true, `count` is set to 0, `count2` remains unchanged, and `done` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `count`, `count2`, and `done` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print('YES')` is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `string`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `x`, `i`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`.
- The condition described in the initial state does not influence the output of the print statement because the print statement is simply outputting the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values or states of the other variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
