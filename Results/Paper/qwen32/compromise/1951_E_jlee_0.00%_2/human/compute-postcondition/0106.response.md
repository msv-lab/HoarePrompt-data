Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `string` is the input string with at least 1 character, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is 1, `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged.**
