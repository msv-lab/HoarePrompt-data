The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print(2)`. This statement simply prints the integer value `2`.

The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count2`, `j`, and `count`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values and conditions of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
