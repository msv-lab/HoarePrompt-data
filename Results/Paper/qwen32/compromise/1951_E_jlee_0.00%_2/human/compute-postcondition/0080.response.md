Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `string` is the input string with at least 1 character.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `j` is initialized to 1.
- `count` is either 0 or a positive integer indicating the first index `j` where `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is 0 unless `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, in which case `count2` is set to 1.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('YES')` directly outputs the string `'YES'`. The variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, and `count2` are defined in the initial state, but they do not influence the output of this specific print statement. The print statement is independent of these variables.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
