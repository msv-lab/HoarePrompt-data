Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `string` is the input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and `n` equals 1.
- `done` is False.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, or `done`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
