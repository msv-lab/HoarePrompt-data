The `continue` statement in Python is typically used within loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, in the given context, there is no loop, so the `continue` statement has no effect on the flow of the program. Therefore, none of the variables are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and `n` equals 1; `done` is False.**
