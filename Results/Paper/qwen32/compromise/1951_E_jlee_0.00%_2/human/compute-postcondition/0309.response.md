To determine what will be printed by the `print(string)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `string` is the input string.
   - `n` is the length of `string`.
   - `j` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the midpoint of the string (rounded up if `n` is odd).
   - `count` is the index of the first character not equal to `x` if such a character exists before the midpoint of the string.
   - `count2` counts the number of characters equal to `x` after `count` up to the midpoint of the string.
   - `done` is initialized as `False`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (though its exact initial value is not provided, it's mentioned that it is incremented).
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `x` is the first character of `string` (`s[0]`).

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `n` is equal to 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
   - If `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`, the state of the variables remains unchanged as per the if part description.

Given these conditions, the `print(string)` statement will print the original `string` unless the conditions specified in the if statements are met and change the state of `string`. However, the description does not indicate that `string` itself is modified in any way under these conditions. Therefore, `string` remains the same.

**Output**:
Output: **string (where string is the input string)**
