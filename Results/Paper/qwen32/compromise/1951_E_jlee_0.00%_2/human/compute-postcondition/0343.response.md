Postcondition: ***`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count2` is equal to `count`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`. `count` is greater than 0. The state of `count` and `done` remains as per the previous conditions. `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. `count` is equal to 1 and `done` is not set to `True`.***
