Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement is executed.

### Initial State Description:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable represents the number of test cases, but it is not used in the provided code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output of the print statement.
- `string`: A newly input string.
- `s`: A list of characters from the newly input string.
- `n`: The length of `s` and must be at least 1.
- `x`: The first character of the newly input string.
- `j`: Initialized to 2.
- `count`: Initially not defined in the provided description, but it seems to be set to 2 if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `count2`: Incremented by 1 if `s[j]` equals `x` and `count` is greater than 0.
- `done`: A boolean variable set to `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. Otherwise, it remains `False`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The value `'YES'` is explicitly given in the print statement and does not depend on any of the variables defined in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
