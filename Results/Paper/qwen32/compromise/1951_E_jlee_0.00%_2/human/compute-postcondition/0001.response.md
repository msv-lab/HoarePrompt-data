The only variable in the loop head of the given for loop is `i` and the range is determined by `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so there's no need to adjust it before the loop starts. The state of `t` is already given as an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, which means the loop will execute at least once.

Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to consider the states of any variables inside the loop. The only requirement is that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
