Output State: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, `done` is True.**

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `done` has been set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
