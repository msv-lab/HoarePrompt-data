Postcondition: **The loop will run for `(n + 1) // 2` iterations unless `done` is set to `True` and the loop breaks early. After the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. `count` will be the index of the first character not equal to `x` if such a character exists before the midpoint of the string. `count2` will count the number of characters equal to `x` after `count` up to the midpoint of the string. `done` will be `False`, indicating the loop did not break early due to one of the conditions being met.**
