arr is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, representing the length of the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that needs to be constructed. The function solve is called for each test case, with the first call having n elements in arr. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
