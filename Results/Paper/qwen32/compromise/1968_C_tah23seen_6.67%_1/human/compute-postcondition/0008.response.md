The provided code snippet modifies the `ans` list by adjusting each element starting from the second element (`ans[1]`) to be the sum of itself and the previous element (`ans[i]`). This operation is performed for all indices `i` from `0` to `n-2`.

Given the initial state, `ans[0]` is already set to `arr[0] + 1`. The code then updates `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it, effectively creating a cumulative sum starting from `ans[0]`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `ans[1]` becomes `ans[1] + ans[0]`
- `ans[2]` becomes `ans[2] + ans[1]` (which now includes the previous `ans[0]` contribution)
- This pattern continues until `ans[n-1]`.

Since the exact values of `arr` and `n` are not specified, we can only describe the transformation in terms of the relationships between the elements.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, the length of `arr` is `n-1`, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `arr[i] + ans[i]` for i in the range from 0 to `n-2`**

In simpler terms, `ans` now contains cumulative sums starting from `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`, with each subsequent element being the sum of the current `arr[i]` and the previous cumulative sum in `ans`.
