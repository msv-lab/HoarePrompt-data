Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, the length of `arr` is `n-1`, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` for i in the range from 0 to `n-2`. The current value of `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`**
