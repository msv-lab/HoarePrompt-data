The given code snippet updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` to be `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This means that the next element in the `ans` list is calculated based on the current element in the `arr` list and the previously computed element in the `ans` list.

Given the initial state, `ans[i + 1]` was either `arr[i + 1]` or a computed value based on the conditions provided. After executing the code snippet, `ans[i + 1]` is directly set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, the length of `arr` is `n-1`, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is now `arr[i] + ans[i]`. `i` is `i + 1`.**
