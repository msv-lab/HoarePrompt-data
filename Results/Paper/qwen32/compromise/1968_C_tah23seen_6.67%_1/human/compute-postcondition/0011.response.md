To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior and how the `ans` list is updated.

The loop:
```python
while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
    ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
```
This loop runs as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. In each iteration, `ans[i + 1]` is incremented by `ans[i]`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`
- `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` for `i` in the range from `0` to `n-2`

The loop modifies `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it repeatedly until `ans[i + 1]` exceeds `arr[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes all the iterations:**
The final state of `ans[i + 1]` will be the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be obtained by adding multiples of `ans[i]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.

In simpler terms, `ans[i + 1]` will be the smallest multiple of `ans[i]` added to `arr[i] + ans[i]` such that the result is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.

Let's formalize this in the output state format:

Output State: **`ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i + 1]` of the form `arr[i] + k * ans[i]` where `k` is a positive integer.**

In natural language:
The final output state is that `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each subsequent element `ans[i + 1]`, it is the smallest number greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + k * ans[i]` for some positive integer `k`. This ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is just large enough to exceed `arr[i + 1]` after adding multiples of `ans[i]`.
