The code modifies the last element of the `ans` list by setting `ans[-1]` to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This means the last element of `ans` is now the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.

Output State: **`ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `1` to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i-1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i-1] + k * ans[i-1]` for some positive integer `k`; `ans[n-1] = ans[n-2] + arr[-1]`.**
