To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`.

2. **Loop Body**:
   - For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-3`:
     - Compute `ans[i + 1]` as `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
     - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then increment `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` repeatedly until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

### Final Output State:
- The final state of `ans` is such that each element `ans[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n-1` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i-1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i-1] + k * ans[i-1]` for some positive integer `k`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
- **Iteration 0**:
  - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`
  - `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1) = 2 * arr[0] + 1`
  - If `ans[1] < arr[1]`, increment `ans[1]` by `ans[0]` until `ans[1] >= arr[1]`.

- **Iteration 1**:
  - `ans[2] = arr[1] + ans[1]`
  - If `ans[2] < arr[2]`, increment `ans[2]` by `ans[1]` until `ans[2] >= arr[2]`.

- **Subsequent Iterations**:
  - This pattern continues for all `i` from `2` to `n-2`.

### Final Output State:
- `ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`.
- For each `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i-1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i-1] + k * ans[i-1]` for some positive integer `k`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state of the `ans` array is such that each element `ans[i]` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i-1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i-1] + k * ans[i-1]` for some positive integer `k`.

**Output State: **`ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i-1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i-1] + k * ans[i-1]` for some positive integer `k`.**
