The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to adjust only `i` for the next iteration of the loop. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i` (where `i` ranges from `0` to `n-3`), and the loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted. The state of `arr`, `n`, `t`, and `ans` should remain as they are.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, the length of `arr` is `n-1`, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` of the form `arr[i] + k * ans[i]` where `k` is a positive integer. If `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to the smallest integer greater than `arr[i + 1]` of the form `arr[i] + k * ans[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i + 1]` remains as `arr[i] + ans[i]`. `i` is `i + 1`**
