The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` modifies the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is `0`, so `ans[i + 1]` refers to `ans[1]` and `ans[i]` refers to `ans[0]`. Therefore, `ans[1]` is updated to `ans[1] + ans[0]`.

Given:
- `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`
- `ans[1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[1]`
- `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`
- `i` is `0`

After the code execution:
- `ans[1]` becomes `ans[1] + ans[0]` which is `ans[1] + (arr[0] + 1)`

Since `ans[1]` was previously less than or equal to `arr[1]`, and `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, the new value of `ans[1]` will be `ans[1] + arr[0] + 1`. This new value of `ans[1]` must still be considered in the context of the precondition that `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.

Output State: **`ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is `0`, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `ans[1] + arr[0] + 1`**
