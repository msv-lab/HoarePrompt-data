The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `i` (which means it was some value from `0` to `n-3`), and it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

So, if `i` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

State: **`ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + k * ans[i]` for some integer `k`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it is updated to the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + k * ans[i]`. `i` is `i + 1`**
