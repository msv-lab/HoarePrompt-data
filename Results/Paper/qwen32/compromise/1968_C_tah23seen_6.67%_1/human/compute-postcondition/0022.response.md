Postcondition: **`ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + k * ans[i]` for some integer `k`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it is updated to the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + k * ans[i]`.**
