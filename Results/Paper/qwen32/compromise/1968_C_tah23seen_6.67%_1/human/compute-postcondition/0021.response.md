To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the transformation applied to the `ans` list within the loop. The loop modifies `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it repeatedly until `ans[i + 1]` exceeds `arr[i + 1]`.

Starting from the initial state:
- `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`.
- For each subsequent `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is initially set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.

The loop condition `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is incremented by `ans[i]` until it exceeds `arr[i + 1]`. This means that `ans[i + 1]` will be the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + k * ans[i]` for some integer `k`.

After all iterations, the final state of `ans` will be:
- `ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`.
- Each subsequent `ans[i + 1]` will be the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + k * ans[i]` for some integer `k`.

In simpler terms, `ans[i + 1]` will be adjusted to be just above `arr[i + 1]` by adding multiples of `ans[i]` as needed.

Given the pattern observed from the first three iterations, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + k * ans[i]` for some integer `k`.**

This means that after all iterations, `ans[i + 1]` will be just above `arr[i + 1]` and will have been incremented by `ans[i]` as many times as necessary to satisfy the loop condition.
