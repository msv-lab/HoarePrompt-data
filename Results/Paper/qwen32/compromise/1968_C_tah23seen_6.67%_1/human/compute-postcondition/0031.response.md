To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `ans` array based on the `arr` array.

Given:
- `ans[0]` is initialized to `arr[0] + 1`.
- For each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is initialized to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
- The loop `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` increments `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce the pattern:
- After 1 iteration: `ans[1]` is `ans[1] + ans[0]`
- After 2 iterations: `ans[1]` is `ans[1] + ans[0] + 1`
- After 3 iterations: `ans[1]` is `ans[1] + ans[0] + ans[0] + 1`

This suggests that `ans[1]` keeps increasing by `ans[0]` until it surpasses `arr[1]`. The loop will continue to execute until `ans[1]` is greater than `arr[1]`.

Let's generalize this:
- Initially, `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0] = arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1) = 2 * arr[0] + 1`.
- The loop increments `ans[1]` by `ans[0]` each time until `ans[1]` exceeds `arr[1]`.

The final value of `ans[1]` after the loop will be the smallest value greater than `arr[1]` that can be expressed as `2 * arr[0] + 1 + k * ans[0]` for some integer `k`.

Given the pattern, if `arr[1]` is `2 * arr[0] + 1 + k * ans[0]` for the smallest integer `k` such that `2 * arr[0] + 1 + k * ans[0] > arr[1]`, then `ans[1]` will be `arr[1]` plus the smallest multiple of `ans[0]` that makes it greater than `arr[1]`.

Since the exact value of `arr[1]` is not provided, we can say that the loop will run until `ans[1]` is just greater than `arr[1]`.

Therefore, the final state will be:
- `ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`.
- `ans[1]` will be the smallest value greater than `arr[1]` that can be expressed as `2 * arr[0] + 1 + k * ans[0]` for some integer `k`.

Given the pattern and the provided output states, the final state can be described as:
Output State: **`ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is the smallest value greater than `arr[1]` that can be expressed as `2 * arr[0] + 1 + k * (arr[0] + 1)` for some integer `k`.**

In simpler terms, `ans[1]` will be the smallest multiple of `ans[0]` added to `2 * arr[0] + 1` that is greater than `arr[1]`.
