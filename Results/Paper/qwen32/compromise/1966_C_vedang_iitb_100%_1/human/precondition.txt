t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
