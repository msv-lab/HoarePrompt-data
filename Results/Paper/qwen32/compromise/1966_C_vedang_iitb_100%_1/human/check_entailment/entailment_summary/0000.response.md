### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the winner of the game based on the MEX (minimum excludant) of the pile sizes. However, the logic used in the program does not align with the optimal strategy for the game described in the problem statement.

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where the winning strategy is determined by the XOR-sum (Nim-sum) of the pile sizes, not the MEX. In Nim, if the XOR-sum of all pile sizes is zero at the start of a player's turn, that player is in a losing position if the opponent plays optimally. Otherwise, they are in a winning position.

Here's how the program should work based on the Nim game strategy:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the number of piles and their sizes.
3. Compute the XOR-sum of the pile sizes.
4. If the XOR-sum is zero, Bob wins because Alice starts in a losing position.
5. Otherwise, Alice wins because she starts in a winning position.

The provided program instead calculates the MEX of the pile sizes and uses it to determine the winner, which is not the correct approach for this game.
