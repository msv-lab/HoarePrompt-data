The only variable in the loop head is `tc`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `tc` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then no change is made to `mexsize` or `maxsize`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
