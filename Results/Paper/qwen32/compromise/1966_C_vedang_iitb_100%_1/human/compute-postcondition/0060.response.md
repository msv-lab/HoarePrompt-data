Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is `a[1]`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1.**
