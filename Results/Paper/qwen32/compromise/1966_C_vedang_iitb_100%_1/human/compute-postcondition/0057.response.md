Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `sz` (which is `a[1]`) equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**
