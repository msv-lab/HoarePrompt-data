The code increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Initially, `mexsize` is 1, so after the operation, `mexsize` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 2, and `sz` is `a[1]`.**
