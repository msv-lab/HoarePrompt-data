Let's analyze the given problem, the provided code, the function summary, and the initial assessment to determine if the program is correct or incorrect.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in a queue. Kirill can bribe people in front of him, paying `a_i` coins to swap with the person at position `i` and `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and `i` if he swaps with the person at position `j`.

### Provided Code and Function Summary
The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend. The function iterates through the queue from the end to the beginning, calculating a cumulative cost `x` which is the sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each position `i`. The function then updates the minimum cost `pergunta` if the current position `i` is less than `m` by considering the cost `x + a[i]`.

### Function Summary
The function summary correctly describes the logic of `func_1`: it calculates the cumulative sum of the minimums of `a[i]` and `b[i]` in reverse order and finds the minimum value of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the cumulative cost of bribing multiple people in sequence. However, let's verify this by analyzing the logic of the program.

### Detailed Analysis
The provided program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the cost of bribing multiple people in sequence. The function `func_1` only considers the minimum cost of bribing a single person and the immediate cost of bribing people between the current position and the target position, but it does not correctly accumulate the costs when bribing multiple people in sequence.

Let's consider the provided example:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
7 3 6 9 1
4 3 8 5 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10
```

**Explanation:**
- Kirill starts at position 6.
- To reach position 3, he can bribe the person at position 5 for 1 coin, then the person at position 4 for 5 coins, and the person at position 3 for 3 coins, which totals to 10 coins.

The provided program will not correctly calculate this because it does not consider the sequence of bribes and their cumulative costs properly.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` does not properly account for the cumulative cost of bribing multiple people in sequence.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
