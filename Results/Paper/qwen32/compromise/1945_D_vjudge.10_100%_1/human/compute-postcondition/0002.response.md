To determine the output state after the execution of the given loop, let's break down the logic step by step.

The loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `0` with the variable `i`. Here's what happens inside the loop:

1. **Condition Check**: `if i < m`
   - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.

2. **Increment x**: `x += min(a[i], b[i])`
   - `x` is incremented by the smaller value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

Let's understand the effect of this loop:

- `x` accumulates the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` from the end of the list to the beginning.
- `pergunta` is updated only when `i` is less than `m`, and it keeps track of the smallest value encountered in the expression `x + a[i]` during these iterations.

After the loop completes, the value of `x` will be the sum of the minimum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` from `i = n-1` to `i = 0`.

The value of `pergunta` will be the smallest value of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m` during the loop iterations.

So, the output state after the loop finishes will be:

- `pergunta` will hold the smallest value of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`.
- `x` will be the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.

Output State: **pergunta is the smallest value of x + a[i] for all i < m, x is the sum of min(a[i], b[i]) for all i from n-1 to 0.**
