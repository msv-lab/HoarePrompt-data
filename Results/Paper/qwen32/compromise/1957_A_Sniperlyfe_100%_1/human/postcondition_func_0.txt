The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where the first element represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements for each test case. Each pair consists of a number of sticks and their respective lengths. The function calculates the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length by 3 across all test cases and returns this sum. However, due to the specific implementation details, the function always returns 0.
