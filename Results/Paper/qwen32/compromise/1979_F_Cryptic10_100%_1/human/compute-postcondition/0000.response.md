The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `q` that takes an integer `d` as input, prints a query in the format "? d" to the standard output, and then reads a line of input from the standard input, which is split into integers and converted into a map object. This map object is implicitly returned by the lambda function.

Since the code does not execute the lambda function or alter any other variables, only the definition of `q` is present. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the lambda function `q` into the program's state.

Output State: **The function `func()` does not take any input parameters. The input for the function is provided interactively through standard input, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in the graph. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function must interact with the interactor by making queries of the form "? d" (0 ≤ d ≤ n - 1) and receiving responses, and finally output the Hamiltonian path in the format "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n". The lambda function `q` is defined to take an integer `d`, print '? d', and return a map of integers read from the input.**
