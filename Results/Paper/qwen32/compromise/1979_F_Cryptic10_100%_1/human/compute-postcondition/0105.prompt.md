Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (where `n` is the integer input by the user); `ops` is an empty list; `p1` and `p2` retain their initial states.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v1`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`, `vx` also excludes `v3`, and `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. In both cases, `p1` and `p2` retain their initial states, and `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)` and `q(0)` respectively.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v1` and optionally `v3` (if `v2` is not greater than 0). `v1` is the value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before removal, `v2` is the value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before removal, and `n` must be at least 5. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`, and `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `vx` has at least 1 element after the removals; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the removal. If `v2 > 0`, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)` at the end. Otherwise, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`, and `ops` includes the additional tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
