Postcondition: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive) with `v1` removed, `v2` removed if `v2` was originally in the set and not equal to `v1`, and `v3` removed if `v2 <= 0`; `vx` still has more than two elements; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before `v1` was removed; `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` if `v2 <= 0`; `ops` is updated to include `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise `ops` is updated to include `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.**
