To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and how it affects the variables based on the initial state provided.

The initial state is:
- `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers.
- `p1` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, 3, and `v1`.
- `p2` is an empty list.
- `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples.
- `v1` and `v2` are unpacked from the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list.

The code snippet is:
```python
(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
```

The code checks if the last element of `p1` (which is `v1`) is equal to `v2`. If they are equal, it appends `v1` to `p2`; otherwise, it appends `v1` to `p1`.

Since `v1` and `v2` are unpacked from the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list, their specific values are not provided, but we can still describe the output state in terms of these variables.

Let's consider the two possible scenarios:

1. If `v1 == v2`, then `p2.append(v1)` is executed. This means `p2` will now contain `v1`.
2. If `v1 != v2`, then `p1.append(v1)` is executed. This means `p1` will now contain `1, 2, 3, v1, v1`.

Thus, the output state can be described as:
- `vx` remains a set containing exactly 2 integers (unchanged).
- `p1` will be `[1, 2, 3, v1, v1]` if `v1 != v2`, otherwise it will be `[1, 2, 3, v1]`.
- `p2` will be `[v1]` if `v1 == v2`, otherwise it will remain an empty list.
- `ops` remains a list containing at least two tuples (unchanged).
- `v1` and `v2` are unpacked from the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list (unchanged).

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers; `p1` is `[1, 2, 3, v1, v1]` if `v1 != v2`, otherwise `p1` is `[1, 2, 3, v1]`; `p2` is `[v1]` if `v1 == v2`, otherwise `p2` is an empty list; `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples; `v1` and `v2` are unpacked from the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list.**
