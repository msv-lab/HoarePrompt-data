The code snippet appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `vx`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ops` now contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`.

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive) except `v1`; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(t - 2)`; `v2` is greater than 0.**
