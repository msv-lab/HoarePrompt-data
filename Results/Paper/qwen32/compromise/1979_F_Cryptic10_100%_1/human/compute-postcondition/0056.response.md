The code snippet removes the value `v3` from the set `vx`. Given that `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`, and `vx` initially contains integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v2`, the set `vx` will no longer include `v3` after the removal.

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`; `n` must be at least 5; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 3)`; `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`**.
