The code snippet creates two new lists, `p1` and `p2`. The list `p1` is initialized with the elements of `vx`, and `p2` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state specifies that `vx` contains either 1 or 2 elements, and `ops` contains all the operations performed during the loop. The value of `ops` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`vx` contains 1 or 2 elements; `ops` contains all the operations performed during the loop; `p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx`; `p2` is an empty list.**
