The code snippet simply appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `vx`, `v1`, `v2`, and `n` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ops` now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` where `n > 2`; `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(n - 4)`, and the current value of `v2` is greater than 0; `ops` now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`.**
