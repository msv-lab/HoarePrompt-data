Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`; `n` must be at least 5; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 3)`; `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`. `ops` has been updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.**

In simpler terms, the set `vx` remains unchanged, still missing `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`. The variable `ops` now includes the additional tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. The values of `n`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` remain as they were initially.
