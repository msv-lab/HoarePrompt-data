Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements after removing `v1`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the removal; `ops` now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)` at the end.**

Natural language: The list `vx` still has at least 2 elements remaining after `v1` has been removed. The values `v1` and `v2` were obtained from the function `q` with the argument `len(vx) - 2` before `v1` was removed. The list `ops` has been updated to include the tuple `(v1, v2)` at its end.
