The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v1` and `v2`, and they come from the `ops` list. The loop iterates over `ops` in reverse order. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to identify the next pair `(v1, v2)` from `ops` in reverse order.

Given that the previous iteration has already processed the last pair in `ops`, the next iteration will process the second-to-last pair in `ops`.

Let's denote the state at the end of the previous iteration as follows:
- `p1[-1] == v2` is `True` or `False`
- Depending on the condition, `p2` is the original `p2` with `v1` appended, or `p1` is the original `p1` with `v1` appended.

Now, for the start of the next iteration:
- We need to move to the previous pair `(v1, v2)` in the `ops` list.

State: **`p1` and `p2` are in the states after the last iteration, `ops` is the original list, and `(v1, v2)` is the second-to-last pair in `ops`**

However, since we are only concerned with the loop head variables `v1` and `v2`, we need to specify the exact values of `v1` and `v2` from the second-to-last pair in `ops`.

Let's assume the original `ops` list is `[(a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an-1, bn-1), (an, bn)]`. After the last iteration, `(v1, v2)` was `(an, bn)`. The next iteration will process `(an-1, bn-1)`.

State: **`v1` is `an-1`, `v2` is `bn-1`**

Since the exact values of `an-1` and `bn-1` are not provided, we express the state in terms of the second-to-last pair in `ops`.

Final Answer:
State: **`v1` is the first element of the second-to-last pair in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the second-to-last pair in `ops`**
