Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. The program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" and then calculates `x + y - z`, which does not accurately determine the minimum deletions required.

To solve the problem correctly, one must find the longest subsequence of the string that does not contain the substrings "map" or "pie". This is a more complex task that involves dynamic programming or another approach to ensure that the minimum number of deletions is calculated properly. The given program does not address this requirement and thus is incorrect.
