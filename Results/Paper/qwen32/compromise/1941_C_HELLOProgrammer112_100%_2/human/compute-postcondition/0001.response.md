Output State: **The output state consists of t lines, each containing an integer. Each integer represents the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string s of the corresponding test case, minus the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'mapie'. The values of t, n, and s from the initial state remain unchanged except that s is used in each iteration to compute the output for that iteration.**
