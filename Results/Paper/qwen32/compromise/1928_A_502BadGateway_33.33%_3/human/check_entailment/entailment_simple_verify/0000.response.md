### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. Let's break down the problem and the given code to understand why.

#### Problem Understanding:
Bob can form another rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle that is different from the original (ignoring rotations).

#### Key Insight:
- If either dimension (`a` or `b`) of the rectangle is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
  - For example, a rectangle of size `2 x 6` can be cut into two `2 x 3` rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a `4 x 3` rectangle.
- If both dimensions (`a` and `b`) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because he will end up with two rectangles of size `1 x (a*b/2)`, which can only form the same `a x b` rectangle when rearranged.

#### Given Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

#### Annotations:
The annotations correctly state that the function `func_1` returns `'yes'` if `b` is even and `'no'` otherwise. However, this logic is incomplete.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the program does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle. It suggests that the program should check if either `a` or `b` is even, which is correct.

#### Correctness Analysis:
The provided program only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient. The correct logic should be to check if either `a` or `b` is even.

However, the original assessment incorrectly identifies a specific test case (`3 2`) where the output would be "No" based on the current logic, which is incorrect. The correct output for `3 2` should indeed be "Yes" because `b` is even.

The original assessment also correctly points out that the logic should be modified to check if either `a` or `b` is even. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate in its conclusion that the program is incorrect, as it does not fully explain why the current logic is insufficient and provides a correct suggestion for improvement.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is inaccurate in its conclusion that the program is incorrect, given that it fails to recognize the specific test case where the current logic is correct (`3 2`). However, the assessment correctly identifies the need to check if either `a` or `b` is even.

Given the problem description and the analysis, the correct logic should indeed check if either dimension is even. Since the current program only checks if `b` is even, it is not fully correct.

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not check if `a` is even, which is necessary to determine if Bob can form another rectangle.
