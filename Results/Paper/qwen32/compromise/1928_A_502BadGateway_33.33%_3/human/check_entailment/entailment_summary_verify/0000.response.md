Let's analyze the problem and the provided code systematically.

### Problem Analysis

Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and then try to form a different rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. The key point is that the new rectangle should be different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

### Key Insight

For Bob to form a different rectangle, at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) must be even. Here's why:
- If \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size \(a/2 \times b\). These two rectangles can be combined to form a rectangle of size \(b \times a\), which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle unless \(a = b\).
- Similarly, if \(b\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size \(a \times b/2\). These two rectangles can be combined to form a rectangle of size \(a \times b\), but rearranged to form \(b \times a\), which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle unless \(a = b\).

Thus, the correct condition is that at least one of \(a\) or \(b\) must be even.

### Provided Code Analysis

The provided code is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

The `func_1` function only checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, otherwise 'no'. This logic is insufficient because it does not consider the case where `a` is even.

### Function Summary

The function summary states that the function checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, otherwise 'no'. This aligns with the provided code but does not reflect the correct logic for solving the problem.

### Original Assessment

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code is incorrect. The correct logic should check if either `a` or `b` is even, not just `b`.

### Corrected Code

The corrected version of the function should be:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle, as it only checks if `b` is even.

**Final: False**
