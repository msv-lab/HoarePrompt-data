Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `l` is assigned the value 0, and `r` is assigned the value `n - 1`.**

In simple terms, the variables `l` and `r` have been set to 0 and `n - 1` respectively. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a`) remain unchanged.
