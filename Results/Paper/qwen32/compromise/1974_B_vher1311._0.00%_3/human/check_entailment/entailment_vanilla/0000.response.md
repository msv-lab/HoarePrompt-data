Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
   
2. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - This function is supposed to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`.
   - It starts by creating a sorted list `unique_chars` of unique characters from the string `b`.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j`, where `i` starts at the beginning of `unique_chars` and `j` starts at the end.
   - The function then iterates over the string `b`:
     - For each character in `b`, it checks if the character is in `unique_chars`.
     - If the character is in `unique_chars`, it replaces all occurrences of that character in `b` with the character at position `j` in `unique_chars` and then decrements `j`.
     - If the character is not in `unique_chars`, it inserts the character at position `i` in `unique_chars` and increments both `i` and `j`. This part of the logic is incorrect because it assumes characters not in `unique_chars` can appear, which contradicts the problem statement.

3. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The function incorrectly modifies the string `b` within the loop, which can lead to incorrect replacements and an incorrect final string.
   - The insertion of characters not in `unique_chars` is incorrect since all characters in `b` should be in `unique_chars` by construction.
   - The function does not actually decode the string `b` back to `s` as intended. Instead, it attempts to replace characters in `b` with characters from `unique_chars` in reverse order, but the implementation is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach to decode the string `b` back to `s` would involve:
  - Creating a sorted list `unique_chars` of unique characters from `b`.
  - Mapping each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character in `unique_chars` in reverse order.
  - Using this mapping to replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the original string `s`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The logic for replacing characters and handling the unique characters is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
