Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` contains two occurrences of `a` if `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing the single element `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing `[a]` if `x` is 1 or 2, and `[a, a]` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` and `a` are the two integers read from the input, `iterable2` is 2.**
