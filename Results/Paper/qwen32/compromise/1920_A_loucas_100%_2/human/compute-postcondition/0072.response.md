Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` equals 2, otherwise `less` is a list (either empty or containing the value of `a` depending on the initial value of `less`), `big` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` equals 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, otherwise `no` is an empty list, `iterable2` is incremented by 1.**
