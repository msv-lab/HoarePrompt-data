The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables or any other conditions outside of the loop. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `loop`, `less`, `big`, `no`, `num`, `innerLoop`) will be altered by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is a list containing all `a` where `x` was 2, `big` is a list containing all `a` where `x` was 1, `no` is a list containing all `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` and `num` is less than 1, `innerLoop` is greater than 0.**
