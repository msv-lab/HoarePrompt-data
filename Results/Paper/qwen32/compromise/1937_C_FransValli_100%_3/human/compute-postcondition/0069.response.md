Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This represents the number of test cases or iterations.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 1. This might represent the number of elements in a list or some other data structure.
3. **`maxi`**: Initialized to 0. This variable seems to store a maximum value based on some condition.
4. **`arr`**: A list that contains:
   - All values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`.
   - If `maxi` is not 0, `maxi` is also included as the last element of `arr`.
5. **`mini`**: The largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```
Let's analyze each variable in the print statement:
- **`'?'`**: A literal string.
- **`maxi`**: As per the initial state, `maxi` is initialized to 0. It will only change if it is explicitly set in the code (not shown in the initial state).
- **`maxi`**: Since it appears twice, it will be printed twice.
- **`i`**: This variable is not defined in the initial state. It is likely a loop variable or some other variable that is used within the code (not shown in the initial state). Since it is not defined, we can only describe it as `i`.

### Output Description:
Given the initial state, we know:
- `maxi` is 0 unless explicitly set otherwise.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value.

Thus, the output will be:
- The literal string `'?'`.
- The value of `maxi` which is 0, printed twice.
- The value of `i`, printed twice.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we describe it as `i`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
