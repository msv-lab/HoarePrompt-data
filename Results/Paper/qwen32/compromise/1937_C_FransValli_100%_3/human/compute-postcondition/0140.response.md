To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables are defined.

### Given Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3.
2. `n` is greater than 1.
3. `maxi` is `n-1` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise `maxi` remains 0.
4. `arr` is reset to `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise `arr` remains unchanged.
5. `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found.
6. `i` is `n-1`.
7. `res` is the value of the user's input.

### Key Points:
- The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is `'<'`, then `maxi` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `maxi` is 0.
- The value of `i` is explicitly set to `n-1`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

- The first argument is a literal string `'?'`.
- The second and third arguments are both `maxi`.
- The fourth and fifth arguments are both `i`.

Since `i` is explicitly set to `n-1`, the fourth and fifth arguments will both be `n-1`.

The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`:
- If `res` is `'<'`, then `maxi` is `n-1`.
- If `res` is not `'<'`, then `maxi` is 0.

### Possible Outputs:
1. If `res` is `'<'`:
   - `maxi` will be `n-1`.
   - The output will be: `'?'`, `n-1`, `n-1`, `n-1`, `n-1`.

2. If `res` is not `'<'`:
   - `maxi` will be 0.
   - The output will be: `'?'`, `0`, `0`, `n-1`, `n-1`.

### Final Output:
Since we don't know the exact value of `res` (it's the user's input), we need to consider both possibilities. However, the problem asks for the most precise description based on the given information.

Given that `i` is explicitly `n-1`, and `maxi` is either `n-1` or `0` based on `res`, the output will be one of these two formats.

Output: **'? [maxi] [maxi] [n-1] [n-1]' (where maxi is n-1 if res is '<', otherwise maxi is 0)**
