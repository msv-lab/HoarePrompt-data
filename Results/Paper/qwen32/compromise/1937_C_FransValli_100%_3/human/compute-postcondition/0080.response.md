To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variable `maxi`**: The problem states that `maxi` is not 0 and `arr` includes `maxi` as its last element if `maxi` is not 0. Therefore, `maxi` is a specific integer value that the user's input was `'='` for, and it is the last element of `arr`.

2. **Variable `i`**: The problem states that `i` is `k + 2`, where `k` is not specified in the initial state. However, `i` is used directly in the print statement, so its value is `k + 2`.

3. **Print Statement**: The statement `print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)` will print the question mark `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi` twice, followed by the value of `i` twice.

Given the above analysis, the output will be:
Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where maxi is the last element of arr and i is k + 2)**

This output reflects the exact values of the variables as described in the initial state.
