To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the variables.

The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` generates numbers from 1 to `n-1`), and for each iteration `i`, it performs the following:
1. It prints a query and flushes the output.
2. It reads the user's input stored in `res`.
3. If `res` is `'<'`, it updates `maxi` to the current value of `i`.

The loop continues until `i` reaches `n-1`. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `n-1`.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the range of the loop.
- `maxi` will be the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or it will remain 0 if no such input was received.
- `arr` and `mini` are not modified within the loop, so they remain as per their initial state unless `maxi` is updated to a non-zero value, in which case `arr` will include `maxi` as its last element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and if `maxi` is not 0, `arr` also includes `maxi` as its last element; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists; `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `maxi` will hold the largest index where the response was `'<'`, and `i` will be `n-1`. The other variables remain as per their initial state unless `maxi` is updated.
