The code snippet `arr = [i]` assigns a new list containing the single element `i` to the variable `arr`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine a specific value for `arr`. However, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is `[i]`, `res` is the input string and its current value is `'<'`.**
