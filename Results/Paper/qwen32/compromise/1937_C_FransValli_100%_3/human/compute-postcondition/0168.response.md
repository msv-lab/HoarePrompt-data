The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented and should be less than `n`.

Let's break down the state adjustments:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it equal to `n`. However, since the loop condition is `i in range(1, n)`, `i` should be set to the next valid value in the range, which is `1` if `n-1` was the last iteration. But given that `i` was `n-1` and we need to increment it, it implies that `i` should be set to `1` if it was the last iteration, but since we are adjusting for the next valid iteration within the range, `i` should be set to `1` if it was `n-1` and we are restarting from the beginning of the range. However, typically, if `i` was `n-1`, the loop would have ended. So, we need to consider the next valid `i` within the range, which would be `1` if `i` was `n-1` and we are restarting, but since the loop is designed to go from `1` to `n-1`, the next valid `i` after `n-1` would be `1` if we are restarting the loop, but typically, the loop would end if `i` was `n-1`.

Given the typical behavior of the loop, if `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have ended. However, if we need to adjust for the next valid iteration within the range, we should consider the loop starting from `1` again if `i` was `n-1`.

But considering the typical behavior and the loop condition, the next valid `i` after `n-1` would be `1` if we are restarting the loop, but typically, the loop would end if `i` was `n-1`.

So, the correct adjustment would be to set `i` to `1` if we are restarting the loop, but typically, the loop would end if `i` was `n-1`.

However, if we need to adjust for the next valid iteration within the range, we should consider the loop starting from `1` again if `i` was `n-1`.

Given the loop condition `for i in range(1, n)`, the next valid `i` after `n-1` would be `1` if we are restarting the loop, but typically, the loop would end if `i` was `n-1`.

So, the correct adjustment would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found, `i` is 1, and `res` is the user input. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[n-1]`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` has `n-1` appended to it.**

However, since the loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`, and `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have ended. So, the correct adjustment would be to consider the loop starting from `1` again if `i` was `n-1`.

If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[n-1]`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` has `n-1` appended to it.**

However, since the loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`, and `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have ended. So, the correct adjustment would be to consider the loop starting from `1` again if `i` was `n-1`.
