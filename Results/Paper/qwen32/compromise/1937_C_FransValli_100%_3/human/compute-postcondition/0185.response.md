The code snippet `res = input()` updates the variable `res` with the new input string value. This does not affect any other variables. The other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `arr` contains at least two elements, `mini` is equal to `item` if `res` is `'>'`, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, and `res` is the new input string.**
