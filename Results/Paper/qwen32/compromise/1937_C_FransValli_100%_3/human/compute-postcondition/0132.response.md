The code snippet sets `maxi` to 0. This change only affects the value of `maxi` and does not impact the other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `mini`, and `i`). 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` is the new input integer; `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and is reset to `[i]` if the user's input was `'<'`; `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found; `i` is `n-1`.**
