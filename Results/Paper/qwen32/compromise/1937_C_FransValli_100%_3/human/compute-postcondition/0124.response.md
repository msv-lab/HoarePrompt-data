To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Variables and Their Values:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3. This value does not affect the print statement directly.
2. **`n`**: An input integer. This value is used to determine the index `i`.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received. This value does not affect the print statement directly.
4. **`arr`**: A list containing at least two elements. The specific elements of this list are not provided, but we know there are at least two.
5. **`mini`**: This variable is set based on the value of `res`:
   - If `res` equals `'>'`, then `mini` is the next element in `arr[1:]` (i.e., `arr[1]`).
   - Otherwise, `mini` remains the first element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`).
6. **`i`**: This is set to `n-1`. This value does not affect the print statement directly.
7. **`res`**: The user's new input, which can be either `'<'` or `'>'`.
8. **`item`**: This is the next element in `arr[1:]`. Since `arr` contains at least two elements, `item` will be `arr[1]`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

- **`'?'`**: A literal string.
- **`mini`**: This will be either `arr[0]` or `arr[1]` depending on the value of `res`.
- **`mini`**: This is repeated, so it will be the same as the previous `mini`.
- **`item`**: This will be `arr[1]`.
- **`item`**: This is repeated, so it will be the same as the previous `item`.

### Determining `mini`:
- If `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is `arr[1]`.
- If `res` is `'<'`, then `mini` is `arr[0]`.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will depend on the value of `res`:
- If `res` is `'>'`, the output will be: `? arr[1] arr[1] arr[1] arr[1]`.
- If `res` is `'<'`, the output will be: `? arr[0] arr[0] arr[1] arr[1]`.

Since the exact value of `res` and the elements of `arr` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `arr` and `res`.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where mini is arr[0] if res is '<' or arr[1] if res is '>', and item is arr[1])**
