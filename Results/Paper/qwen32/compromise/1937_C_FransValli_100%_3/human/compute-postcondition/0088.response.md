The code snippet `res = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state except for introducing `res` with the value of the user's input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` is `[0]`; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists; `i` is `n-1`; `res` is the user's input.**
