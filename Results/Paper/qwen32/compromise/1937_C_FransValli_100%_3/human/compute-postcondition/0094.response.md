Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` is `[0]` if `res` is not equal to `'='`, otherwise `arr` is `[0, n-1]`; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists; `i` is `n-1`; `res` is the user's input. If `res` is equal to `'='`, then `arr` is updated to `[0, n-1]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains `[0]`.**
