To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved in the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown of the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement, so we don't need to consider its value.
- `n` is an input integer. This variable is used to determine the value of `i`, which is `n-1`.
- `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received. This variable is not used in the `print` statement, so we don't need to consider its value.
- `arr` contains at least two elements. `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
- `i` is `n-1`. This variable is not used in the `print` statement, so we don't need to consider its value.
- `item` is a variable that is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, based on the `print` statement, it seems that `item` should be a value that is relevant to the context, possibly derived from the input or the list `arr`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

We know:
- `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
- `item` is a variable whose value is not explicitly given, but it is printed twice.

Since `mini` is explicitly defined as the first element of `arr`, we can denote it as `arr[0]`. However, the exact value of `arr[0]` is not provided, so we will refer to it as `mini`.

The variable `item` is not defined in the initial state, but it is printed twice in the `print` statement. Without additional context, we can only describe `item` as it is, a variable whose value is not explicitly known from the given information.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the first element of the list `arr` and [item] is the value of the variable `item`)**
