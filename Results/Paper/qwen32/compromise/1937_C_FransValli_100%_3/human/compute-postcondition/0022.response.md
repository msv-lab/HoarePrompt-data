Let's break down the given information and determine what each variable represents and what will be printed.

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). However, `t` is not used in the provided print statement.
2. **Variable `n`**: It must be greater than 1. However, `n` is also not used in the provided print statement.
3. **Variable `maxi`**: It is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given. Since there is no indication that any user input has been given, we can assume `maxi` is `0`.
4. **Variable `arr`**: It is initialized as a list containing a single element, `0`. Therefore, `arr[0]` is `0`.
5. **Variable `i`**: This variable is mentioned in the print statement but is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined, it will raise a `NameError` if the code is executed as is. However, for the purpose of this task, we will assume that `i` is intended to be `maxi` based on the pattern of usage in the print statement.

Given these points, the print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is `0` (as no user input indicating `'<'` has been given).
- `arr[0]` is `0`.
- `maxi` is `0` (repeated).
- `i` is assumed to be `maxi` which is `0`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
