Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` contains at least two elements; `mini` is the next element in `arr[1:]`; `i` is `n-1`; `res` is the user's new input; `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`**

Explanation: The value of `mini` has been updated to be equal to `item`. All other variables retain their initial state values.
