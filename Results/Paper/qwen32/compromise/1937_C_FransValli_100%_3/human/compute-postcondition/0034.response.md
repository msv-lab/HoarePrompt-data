The code snippet `arr = [i]` assigns a new list containing only the value of `i` to the variable `arr`. This means that any previous value of `arr` is overwritten.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is `[i]`, and `res` is the new input string.**
