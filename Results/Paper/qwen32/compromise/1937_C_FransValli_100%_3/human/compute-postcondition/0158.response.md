The code appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given that `arr` was initially `[0]` and `i` is `n-1`, after appending `i` to `arr`, `arr` becomes `[0, n-1]`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `arr` is `[0, n-1]`, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the user input, `res` is not `'<'`, and `res` is `'='`.**
