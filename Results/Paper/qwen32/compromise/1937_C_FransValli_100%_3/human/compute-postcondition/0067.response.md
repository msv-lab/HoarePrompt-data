Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and if `maxi` is not 0, `arr` also includes `maxi` as its last element; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.**

Explanation: The value of `maxi` has been set to 0, while the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `mini` remain unchanged.
