The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`.

The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 1. The initial value of `i` is set to `n-1` before the loop starts, but this value of `i` is not used before the loop starts; it will be overwritten by the `range` function. Therefore, the only requirement for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 1.

So, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 1. The values of `t`, `maxi`, `arr`, and `mini` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and is reset to `[i]` if the user's input was `'<'`; `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found; `i` is `n-1`**
