To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t`: An integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3. This variable does not directly influence the print statement.
- `n`: The input integer. This variable is used to set the value of `i` to `n-1`, which does not directly influence the print statement.
- `maxi`: The largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`. If no such response was given, `maxi` is 0.
- `arr`: A list containing all indices `i` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'`.
- `mini`: The largest index in `arr` that resulted in a `'>'` response during the loop iterations.
- `i`: Set to `n-1`. This variable does not directly influence the print statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

This statement will print the string `'!'` followed by the values of `maxi` and `mini`.

To determine the exact values of `maxi` and `mini`:
- `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`. If no such response was given, it defaults to 0.
- `mini` is the largest index in `arr` that resulted in a `'>'` response. If no such response was given, `mini` would be undefined based on the description, but for the purpose of this task, we assume it retains its last assigned value or defaults to 0 if no `'>'` responses were given.

Given the initial state, we don't have specific values for `maxi` and `mini`, but we can describe them based on the conditions provided.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where maxi is the largest index i for which the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was given, and mini is the largest index in arr that resulted in a '>' response, or 0 if no such response was given)**
