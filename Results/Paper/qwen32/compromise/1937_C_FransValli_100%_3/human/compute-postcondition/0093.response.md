Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` is `[0, n-1]`; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists; `i` is `n-1`; `res` is the user's input, and `res` is equal to `'='`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `i` is `n-1`, the new value of `arr` is `[0, n-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
