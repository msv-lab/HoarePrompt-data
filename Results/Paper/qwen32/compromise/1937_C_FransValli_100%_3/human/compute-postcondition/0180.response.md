Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `arr` contains at least two elements, `mini` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the input string, and the current value of `res` is `'>'`.**
