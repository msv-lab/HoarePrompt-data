The code snippet `res = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `arr`, `mini`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `arr` is `[0]`, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the user input.**
