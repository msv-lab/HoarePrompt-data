Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `res` is an input string.**

Explanation: The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 1000. The value of `n` is still greater than 1. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. A new variable `res` is introduced and assigned the value of an input string.
