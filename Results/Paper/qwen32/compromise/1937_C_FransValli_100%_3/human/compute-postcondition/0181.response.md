The code snippet `mini = item` assigns the value of `item` to the variable `mini`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `arr`, `i`, `res`) remain unchanged. Since the value of `item` is not specified in the initial state, we will denote `mini` as being equal to `item` in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `arr` contains at least two elements, `mini` is equal to `item`, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the input string, and the current value of `res` is `'>'`.**
