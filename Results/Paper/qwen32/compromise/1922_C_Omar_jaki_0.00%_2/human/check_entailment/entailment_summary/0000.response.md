### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the cumulative distances to the closest city from the midpoint between two specified cities. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation of the program that make it incorrect.

1. **Initialization and Calculation of Closest Cities:**
   - The program initializes `a` with sentinel values `-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0` at the beginning and end of the list of city positions. This is intended to handle edge cases but does not correctly address the calculation of closest cities.
   - The list `b` is initialized with `[0, 0]`. The subsequent loop attempts to populate `b` with cumulative distances, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. Specifically, the expression `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` does not correctly compute the distances to the closest city.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - When handling queries, the program uses indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` to access elements in `b` for forward queries and `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` for backward queries. This indexing is incorrect and does not reflect the intended computation of the minimum coins required to travel between cities.

3. **Incorrect Distance Calculation:**
   - The core issue is that the program does not correctly calculate the minimum coins required to travel between cities using the closest city rule. Instead, it seems to be trying to calculate some form of cumulative distance, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to accurately determine the closest city for each city and does not properly compute the minimum coins required for each query.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
