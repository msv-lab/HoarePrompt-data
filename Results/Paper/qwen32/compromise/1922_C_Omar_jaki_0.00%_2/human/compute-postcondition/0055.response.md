To determine what will be printed by the `print(b, 'B')` statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided and see if there is any information about the variable `b`.

### Initial State Analysis:
- The initial state is described as `[0, 0, 1, 1]`. This suggests that there might be a list named something like `balances` or `arr` containing these elements.
- However, there is no explicit mention of a variable `b` in the initial state.

### Code Analysis:
- The code snippet is `print(b, 'B')`.
- This line attempts to print the value of the variable `b` followed by the string `'B'`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state provided, there is no information about the variable `b`. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the exact value of `b` from the given information.

However, if we assume that `b` is intended to be one of the elements from the list `[0, 0, 1, 1]` (which is a common assumption when such a list is mentioned), we cannot definitively say which element `b` refers to without additional context.

Since the problem asks for the most precise description possible, and since `b` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we must conclude that the value of `b` is unknown based on the provided information.

### Final Output:
Output: **b B (where b is the value of the variable b, which is not specified in the initial state)**
