The value of `u` is decremented by 1. The list and the values of `c` and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: the list remains [0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, ..., sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}), sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}]; `u` is now `u - 1`; `c` is the first value returned by `r()`, and `d` is the second value returned by `r()`.
