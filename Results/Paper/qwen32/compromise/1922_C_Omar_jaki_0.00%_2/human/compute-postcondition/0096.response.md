The code `u -= 1` decrements the value of `u` by 1. Since `u` is initially a value that evaluates to `True`, it is treated as `1` in arithmetic operations. After decrementing by `1`, `u` becomes `0`, which evaluates to `False`.

The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `a` is (-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0); `b` is [0, 0]; `u` is 0**
