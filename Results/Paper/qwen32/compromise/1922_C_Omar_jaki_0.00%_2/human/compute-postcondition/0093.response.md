Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- `t` is initialized to `0`.
- `a` is a tuple with the values `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0)`.
- `b` is a list containing two zeros `[0, 0]`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(b, 'B')
```

Here, `b` is explicitly defined as `[0, 0]`. Therefore, the value of `b` is known and can be directly used in the output.

The string `'B'` is a literal string and will be printed as it is.

Combining these, the output of the print statement will be the list `b` followed by the string `'B'`.

Output: **[0, 0] B**
