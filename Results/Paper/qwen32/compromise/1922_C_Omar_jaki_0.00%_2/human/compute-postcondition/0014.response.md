The given code snippet assigns the value of `y - x` to the variable `v`. No other variables are modified in the snippet. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `v` with the value `y - x`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value returned by `r()`, which satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4-1\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of `n+2` integers where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the last element is `2000000000.0`, and the middle `n` elements are the original integers in increasing order; `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n+2\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\); `r` is a lambda function that maps input to integers; `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, (y - x) + v]`; `v` is `y - x`.**

In simpler terms, the output state includes all the initial conditions except that a new variable `v` has been introduced with the value `y - x`.
