To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. These variables are derived from the `zip` function applied to slices of the list `a`.

Given the loop:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` were derived as follows:
- `w` was `a[0]` (which is `0`)
- `x` was `a[1]` (which is `1`)
- `y` was `a[2]` (which is `2`)
- `z` was `a[3]` (which is `3`)

For the next iteration, the indices will shift by one position:
- `w` should be `a[1]` (which is `1`)
- `x` should be `a[2]` (which is `2`)
- `y` should be `a[3]` (which is `3`)
- `z` should be `a[4]` (but since `a` only has 4 elements, there is no `a[4]`)

Since there is no `a[4]`, the loop will terminate after this iteration.

However, if we consider the state just before the loop terminates, the state would be:
- `w` is `1`
- `x` is `2`
- `y` is `3`
- `z` would be undefined because there is no `a[4]`, but for the sake of understanding the pattern, we can say it would attempt to be `a[4]`.

The other variables `a`, `u`, and `t` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of what would be the next iteration (if it were to exist) is:
State: **`a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, `u` is `0`, `t` is `0`, `b` is `[0, 0, v]`, `w` is `1`, `x` is `2`, `y` is `3`**

But since the loop will terminate, the actual state right before termination is:
State: **`a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, `u` is `0`, `t` is `0`, `b` is `[0, 0, v]`**
