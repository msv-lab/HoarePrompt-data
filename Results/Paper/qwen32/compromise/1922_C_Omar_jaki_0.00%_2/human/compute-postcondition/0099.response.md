To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is 0.
- `a` is a tuple `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0)`.
- `b` is a list `[0, 0]`.
- `u` is 0.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()` such that `c` is less than `d`.

### Key Points:
- The function `r()` returns two values `c` and `d` where `c < d`.
- `b` is a list with two elements, both set to 0.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

Let's break down the indices used in the list `b`:
- `(d - 1) * 2`: Since `d` is an integer greater than `c` and both are returned by `r()`, this expression will evaluate to an even number.
- `(c - 1) * 2`: Similarly, this will also evaluate to an even number, but it will be less than `(d - 1) * 2` because `c < d`.

Given that `b` only has two elements (`b[0]` and `b[1]`), the valid indices for `b` are 0 and 1. Therefore, the expressions `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` must result in either 0 or 1.

However, since `b` has only two elements and the indices are calculated as `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`, the only feasible values for these indices within the bounds of the list `b` are 0. This implies that both `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` must be 0 because any other value would exceed the list's bounds.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
```python
print(b[0] - b[0])
```

Since `b[0]` is 0 (as per the initial state):
```python
print(0 - 0)
```

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output `0`.

Output: **0**
