To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `u` is 0.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function `r()`**: Since the function `r()` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. We will represent them as `c` and `d` respectively.
2. **List `b`**: The list `b` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]`. We will represent these as `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` respectively.
3. **Expression `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`**: These expressions will evaluate to indices into the list `b`.

### Calculation:
- The expression `c * 2 - 1` calculates an index into the list `b`.
- The expression `d * 2 - 1` calculates another index into the list `b`.
- The `print` statement subtracts the value at index `d * 2 - 1` from the value at index `c * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `c`, `d`, and the list `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical result. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the values at the specified indices in the list `b`.

Therefore, the output can be described as follows:
Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`, and `b` is the list from which elements are being accessed)**
