To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variable `u`**: It is mentioned that `u` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1. This means if `u` was initially `n`, now it is `n-1`. However, `u` is not used directly in the print statement, so we can ignore this detail for determining the output.

2. **Variables `c` and `d`**: These are the values returned by a function `r()`. We know that `c` is greater than or equal to `d` (`c >= d`). However, without knowing the specific implementation of `r()`, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`.

3. **List `b`**: The print statement involves accessing elements of a list `b` using indices derived from `c` and `d`. Specifically, it computes `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]`.

Given these points, let's analyze the print statement:
- `c * 2 - 1`: This expression calculates an index into the list `b`.
- `d * 2 - 1`: This expression calculates another index into the list `b`.
- The print statement then subtracts the value at the second index from the value at the first index in the list `b`.

Since we don't have the specific values of `c`, `d`, and the contents of the list `b`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are the values returned by r(), c >= d, and b is a list)**
