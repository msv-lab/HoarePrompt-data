Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000. The string s is of length m and contains only the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**
