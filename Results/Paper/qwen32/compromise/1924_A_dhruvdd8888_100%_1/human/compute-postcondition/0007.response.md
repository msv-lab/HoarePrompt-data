To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the given loop and how it modifies the variables `win`, `ans`, and `ps`.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `win` is an empty set.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `ps` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is in the set `us` (which contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets):
       - Add `i` to the set `win`.
       - If the length of `win` equals `k` (meaning all first `k` alphabets have been encountered):
         - Append `i` to the list `ans`.
         - Increment `ps` by 1.
         - Clear the set `win`.

3. **Termination:**
   - The loop stops once all characters in `s` have been processed.

4. **Final State:**
   - `win` will be empty because it gets cleared every time its length reaches `k`.
   - `ans` will contain the last character of each complete set of the first `k` alphabets found in `s`.
   - `ps` will be the number of complete sets of the first `k` alphabets found in `s`.

**Output State:** **`win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the last character of each complete set of the first `k` alphabets found in `s`; `ps` is the number of complete sets of the first `k` alphabets found in `s`.**
