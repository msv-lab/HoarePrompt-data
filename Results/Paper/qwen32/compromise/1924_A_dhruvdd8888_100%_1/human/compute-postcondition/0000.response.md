Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, where 1 <= `n` <= 26, 1 <= `k` <= 26, and 1 <= `m` <= 1000; the string `s` is of length `m` and contains only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; the sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` remains unchanged, while `n`, `k`, and `m` are assigned specific integer values from the input, adhering to the given constraints. The string `s` is not affected by this snippet and retains its initial description.
