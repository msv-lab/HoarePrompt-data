Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, then no changes are made to `n` or `k`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the relationship between `k - 1` and `n - k + 1` is determined, where either `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1` or `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.**
