Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`. If no such pair exists, we output `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads:
     - The length of the array `N`.
     - The array `nums` of `N` integers.
     - The number of queries `q`.
     - `q` queries, each consisting of two integers `l` and `r`.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program creates an array `arr` that stores segments of the array `nums` where each segment consists of consecutive equal elements.
   - The segments are stored as tuples `(start_index, end_index, value)`.
   - For example, if `nums` is `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`, `arr` will be `[(1, 2, 1), (3, 3, 2), (4, 5, 1)]`.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks if the segment found overlaps with the range `[l, r]`.
   - If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if there is a valid pair `(s-1, s)`.
   - If the segment ends before `r`, it checks if there is a valid pair `(s, e+1)`.
   - If no valid pair is found, it outputs `-1 -1`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Segments:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple segments within the range `[l, r]`.
   - It only checks the first segment found and does not consider other segments that might have different values.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array has only one unique element in the range `[l, r]`.
   - It might incorrectly output `-1 -1` even when there are valid pairs.

3. **Incorrect Output:**
   - The program might output incorrect indices because it does not correctly determine the indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**
