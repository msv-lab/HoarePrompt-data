The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `nums`. This means that `nums` will now contain the integers that were provided in the input.

The initial state mentioned includes the integer `N` representing the length of the array `a`, and the number of queries `q` along with their boundaries `l` and `r`, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is the integer input representing the length of the array `a`. The initial state regarding the number of queries `q` and the query boundaries `l` and `r` remains unchanged. `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.**

In simpler terms, `nums` now holds the integers from the input, while `N`, `q`, `l`, and `r` retain their original values.
