The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, it starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array a. The following line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of queries. The next q lines each contain two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of each query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
