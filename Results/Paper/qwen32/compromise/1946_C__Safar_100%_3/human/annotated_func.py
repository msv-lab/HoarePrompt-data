#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple \((a, b)\) represents an edge between vertices `a` and `b` in the tree, `g` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `g[a]` contains all vertices `b` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b`.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: 
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is the value of the variable r)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, the number of edges to be removed such that \(1 \leq k < n\); and `edges`, a list of tuples representing the edges between vertices. The function performs a binary search to determine a value `r` and prints it. The purpose of the function is to compute and print a value related to the structure of the tree after hypothetical edge removals, but it does not return the modified tree structure.
