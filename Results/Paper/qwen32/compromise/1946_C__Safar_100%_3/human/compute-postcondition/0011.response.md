The code snippet `stack.append((node, x))` appends a tuple `(node, x)` to the `stack` list. The values of `node` and `x` are not specified in the initial state, but we know that `x` is initially 1. After the execution of this line, `stack` will have an additional element.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where `g[1]` must have at least one element, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, x)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is in `visited`. Additionally, `node` is not equal to `p`.**

In natural language: The `stack` now contains an additional tuple `(node, x)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
