Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; and `edges`, a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree. The function returns the resulting structure of the tree after removing `k` edges, which may result in multiple disjoint trees or a single tree with fewer edges.**
