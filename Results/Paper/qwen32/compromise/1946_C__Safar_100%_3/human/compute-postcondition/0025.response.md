The code snippet `r += 1` increments the variable `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial state, the value of `r` was 0, so after the increment, `r` becomes 1.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is 1, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is in the `visited` set. Additionally, `x` is equal to 1. The current value of `d[x]` is greater than or equal to `A`.**
