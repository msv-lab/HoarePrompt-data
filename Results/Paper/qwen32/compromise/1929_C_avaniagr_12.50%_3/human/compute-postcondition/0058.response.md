Let's analyze the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This suggests that `t` is being decremented by 1, but the initial value of `t` is not provided. This operation does not affect the `print` statement directly.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided in the input: These integers are mentioned but are not used in the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.
- None of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a` are used in the print statement, so their values do not influence the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
