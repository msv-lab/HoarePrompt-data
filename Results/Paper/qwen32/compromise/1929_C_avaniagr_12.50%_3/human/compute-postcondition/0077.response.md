Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided in the input. If `x == k - 1`, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `z` is calculated as \((x + 1) + \frac{(k-1) \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{k-1}\right)^{x+1}\right)}{k-2}\), `i` is set to `x`, and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `z` and `i` are calculated only if the condition `x != k - 1` is true.**
