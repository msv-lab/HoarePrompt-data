The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. It does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a` as described in the initial state. The code directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but none of these variables are used in the print statement.
2. The print statement is `print('NO')`, which explicitly prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
