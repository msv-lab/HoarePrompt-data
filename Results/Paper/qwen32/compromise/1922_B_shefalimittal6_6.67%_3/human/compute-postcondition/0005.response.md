The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is the loop variable that iterates over the elements of the list `nums`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least one element. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `num_of_lens` are not directly involved in the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

So, the state needs to be adjusted such that `nums` is a list with at least one integer.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer**
