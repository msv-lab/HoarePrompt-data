The code calculates the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` that are not equal to `cnt`. This sum is stored in the variable `total_sum`.

Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `nums` is a list of integers.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where keys are unique elements from `nums` and values are their respective counts.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
- `cnt` is an integer with a value of at least 2.
- `res` is updated only if `cnt` is at least 3, otherwise it remains unchanged.

The only variable that changes is `total_sum`, which is computed as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` that are not equal to `cnt`.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state, `cnt` is an integer with a value of at least 2, `res` is unchanged if `cnt` is less than 3 or `res` is the original value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is at least 3, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` that are not equal to `cnt`.**
