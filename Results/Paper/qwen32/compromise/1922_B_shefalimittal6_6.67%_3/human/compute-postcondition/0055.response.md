The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, which iterates over the values in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to identify the next value that `cnt` will take from `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `res` has been updated based on the value of `cnt` from the previous iteration.
- `t` has been decremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
- `num_of_lens` remains unchanged as a dictionary.
- `nums` remains unchanged as a list of integers from the input.

Since `cnt` is the only variable that changes with each iteration and it takes values from `num_of_lens.values()`, the state at the start of the next iteration will involve `cnt` taking the next value from this collection.

Let's denote the current value of `cnt` at the end of the previous iteration as `cnt_current`. The next value of `cnt` at the start of the next iteration, `cnt_next`, will be the subsequent value in the iteration over `num_of_lens.values()`.

State: **`res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` was greater than or equal to 3, and plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, and `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.**

Without knowing the specific values in `num_of_lens`, we can't determine the exact next value of `cnt`, but we know it will be the next value in the iteration sequence.
