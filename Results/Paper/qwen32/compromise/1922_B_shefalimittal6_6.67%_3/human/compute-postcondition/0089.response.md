The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `cnt` to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a list of integers.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`.
- `t` remains in its initial state.
- `n` remains in its initial state.
- `res` is adjusted based on the value of `cnt` and the values in `num_of_lens`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` had a specific value, and now we need to set `cnt` to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is at least 2, and `res` is also increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is at least 3, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**
