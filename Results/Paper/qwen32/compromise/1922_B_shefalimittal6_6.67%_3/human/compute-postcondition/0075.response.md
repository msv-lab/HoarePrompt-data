The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. If there are more elements in `nums` to process, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the current element being processed, and `num_of_lens[x]` was incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least one more element.

Let's assume that the current element `x` was the last element processed in the previous iteration. Therefore, `x` needs to be updated to the next element in the list `nums`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements; `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, where `x` is the next element in the list `nums` to be processed.**
