To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it affects the variables.

The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `nums` and increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. This means that after the loop completes, `num_of_lens` will contain the count of each unique element in `nums`.

Let's break down the final state step-by-step:

- `nums`: This list remains unchanged as it is only being read, not modified.
- `num_of_lens`: This dictionary will have keys as the unique elements from `nums` and values as their respective counts in `nums`.
- `res`, `t`, `n`: These variables are not affected by the loop body and remain in their initial state.

Given the initial state and the loop body, the final state of `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary where each element in `nums` is a key, and its value is the number of times it appears in `nums`.

Let's put this into the required format:

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`; `res`, `t`, and `n` remain in their initial state.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary that counts how many times each number appears in the list `nums`. The list `nums` itself and the variables `res`, `t`, and `n` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
