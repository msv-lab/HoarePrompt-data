The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` calculates the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time and adds this value to `res`. Given that `cnt` is an integer with a value of at least 3, the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` will be a specific integer based on the value of `cnt`. The other variables (`nums`, `num_of_lens`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must contain at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `res` is the original value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state, and `cnt` is an integer with a value of at least 3.**
