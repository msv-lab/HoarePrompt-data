The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The variables `t` and `n` retain their initial values, and `num_of_lens` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.**
