To determine the necessary state adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `num_of_lens.values()`, so we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` contains at least one value for the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop iterates over `num_of_lens.values()`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair.
2. **Adjust the state of `num_of_lens`**: Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` is not empty.
3. **Adjust the state of `nums`**: To ensure `num_of_lens` is not empty, `nums` must contain at least one integer. This will automatically populate `num_of_lens` with at least one key-value pair.
4. **Other variables**: The variables `res`, `t`, and `n` are not mentioned in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this reasoning, the adjusted state should ensure that `nums` contains at least one integer, which will in turn ensure that `num_of_lens` is not empty.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must contain at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `res` is 0, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state**.
