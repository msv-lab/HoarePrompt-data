Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state. If `cnt` is an integer with a value of at least 2, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` that are not equal to `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. If `cnt` is at least 3, `res` is also increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` as per the initial condition.**
