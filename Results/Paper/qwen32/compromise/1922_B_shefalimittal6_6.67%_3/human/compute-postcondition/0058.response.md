The code calculates `total_sum` by summing all the values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary except for the current `cnt` value. The values of `res`, `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by this snippet.

Output State: **`res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` again if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, and `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` value.**
