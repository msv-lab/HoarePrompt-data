Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` is 0, `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with counts of each unique element in `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` was greater than or equal to 3, and plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration. `n` is an input integer. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. `nums` is a list of integers from the input. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` again if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers from the input; `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` value. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged from its initial value plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if applicable.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and an additional `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is further incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration. `n` is an input integer. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. `nums` is a list of integers from the input. `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
