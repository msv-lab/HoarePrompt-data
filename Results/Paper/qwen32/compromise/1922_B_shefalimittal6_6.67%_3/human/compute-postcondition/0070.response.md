The code provided is `n = int(input())`, which reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `res`, `total_sum`, `num_of_lens`, or `t`. The only change is the introduction of the variable `n` with the value provided by the user.

Output State: **`res` is the cumulative sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt >= 3` and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt >= 2` where `total_sum` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt`, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer.**
