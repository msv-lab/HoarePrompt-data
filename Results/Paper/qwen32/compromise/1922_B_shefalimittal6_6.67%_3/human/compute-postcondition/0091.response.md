Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is at least 3, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.**
