The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next value that `cnt` will take from `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer.
- `cnt` is `cnt_next` at the end of the previous iteration.
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is further increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` excluding those equal to `cnt`.
- Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

Since `cnt` iterates over `num_of_lens.values()`, at the start of the next iteration, `cnt` will take the next value from this collection. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `res`) do not change in the loop head.

Let's denote the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` as `cnt_next`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `cnt` set to this next value.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is unchanged from the previous iteration**.
