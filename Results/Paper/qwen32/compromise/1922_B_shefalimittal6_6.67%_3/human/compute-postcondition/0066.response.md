Postcondition: **`res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and an additional `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is further incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration. `n` is an input integer. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. `nums` is a list of integers from the input. `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` value.**
