You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

        print(res)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the cumulative sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt >= 3` and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt >= 2` where `total_sum` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` for each test case. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `n` and `nums` are reinitialized for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the triangle inequality theorem, which is crucial for forming a non-degenerate triangle. The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)) of a triangle, the following must hold: \(a + b > c\).

The program currently only checks combinations of sticks based on their counts and sums, but it does not ensure that the chosen sticks can form a valid triangle. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 2 2 3 3
```

The lengths of the sticks are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^3 = 8\), and \(2^3 = 8\).

The program will count combinations like (2, 4, 4) and (4, 8, 8) as valid, but these do not satisfy the triangle inequality:
- For (2, 4, 4): 2 + 4 > 4 is true, 2 + 4 > 4 is true, 4 + 4 > 2 is true. This combination is valid.
- For (4, 8, 8): 4 + 8 > 8 is true, 4 + 8 > 8 is true, 8 + 8 > 4 is true. This combination is valid.

However, the combination (2, 4, 8) is not valid because 2 + 4 is not greater than 8.

The program does not check for the triangle inequality condition when considering all possible combinations of three sticks. Therefore, it can incorrectly count invalid combinations as valid triangles.

To fix this, the program should iterate over all combinations of three sticks and explicitly check if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.
