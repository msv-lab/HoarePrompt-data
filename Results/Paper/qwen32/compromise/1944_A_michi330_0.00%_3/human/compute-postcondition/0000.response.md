The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases. The initial state mentions that `t` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided, and the conditions on `n` and `k` (from the initial state) remain unchanged as they pertain to the test cases themselves, not to the variable `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; Each test case contains two integers n and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.**
