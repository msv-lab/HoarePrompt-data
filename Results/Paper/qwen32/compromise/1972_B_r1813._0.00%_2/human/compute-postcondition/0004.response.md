The code snippet `index += 1` increments the value of the variable `index` by 1. The initial value of `index` is 0, so after the increment, `index` becomes 1. The other variables (`input`, `data`, and `t`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`input` is assigned the entire input string from standard input; `data` is a list containing all the input values split by whitespace; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.**
