Precondition: **The function `func_1` does not take any direct input parameters. However, it is expected to read input from standard input where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", representing the state of each coin (facing up or down).**
