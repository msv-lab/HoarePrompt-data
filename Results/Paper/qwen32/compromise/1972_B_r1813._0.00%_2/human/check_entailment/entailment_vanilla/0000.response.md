Reasoning:
The problem at hand revolves around a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins left. The task is to determine if Alice can win the game given the initial configuration of the coins, assuming both players play optimally.

The key insight to solving this problem is based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always win by ensuring that she leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob on his turn. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always respond in such a way that an even number of facing-up coins remains for Alice, leading to Bob's victory.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It reads the input, counts the number of 'U' (facing-up coins) in the string for each test case, and then checks the parity of this count. If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating that Alice will win. If the count is even, it appends 'NO', indicating that Bob will win. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided program, the program accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

Correctness: **True**
