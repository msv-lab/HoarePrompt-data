### Reasoning:

The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of coins `n` and a string `s` of length `n` representing the state of each coin ("U" for up and "D" for down). The program then determines if Alice will win the game based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ("U") in the string `s`.

The key insight here is that Alice wins if the number of "U" coins is odd, and Bob wins if the number of "U" coins is even. This is because the game can be reduced to a problem of parity: each move flips the parity of the number of "U" coins, and the player who faces a situation with no "U" coins loses. Since the game ends in a finite number of moves, the player who starts (Alice) will win if the initial number of "U" coins is odd, as she can always force the game into a state where Bob faces an even number of "U" coins, eventually leading to a win for Alice.

The program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of "U" coins in each test case and appending "YES" to the results list if the count is odd, and "NO" if the count is even. Finally, it prints the results.

Given the problem description and the provided execution states, the program appears to be correctly implemented and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

### Correctness: **True**
