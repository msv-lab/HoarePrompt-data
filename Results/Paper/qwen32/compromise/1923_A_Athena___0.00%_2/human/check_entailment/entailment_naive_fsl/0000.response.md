Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. Let's analyze the program and find a counterexample:

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Moves**: The program simply counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip in the list. However, this does not account for the actual minimum number of moves required to move chips into a contiguous block.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Edge Cases**: The program removes leading and trailing zeros but does not correctly handle the placement of chips within the remaining segment.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
7
0 0 1 0 1 0 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- The chips are at positions 3, 5, and 7.
- To form a single block, we need to move the chips to positions 3, 4, and 5.
- The chip at position 7 needs to move 2 steps to position 5.
- The chip at position 5 needs to move 1 step to position 4.
- Total moves = 2 + 1 = 3.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
3
```

While this particular example might seem to work, let's consider another case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
1 0 0 0 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The chips are at positions 1, 5, and 6.
- To form a single block, we need to move the chips to positions 1, 2, and 3.
- The chip at position 5 needs to move 1 step to position 2.
- The chip at position 6 needs to move 1 step to position 3.
- Total moves = 1 + 1 = 2.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
3
```

In this case, the program incorrectly counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which does not reflect the actual minimum number of moves required.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of moves required to form a contiguous block of chips. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
