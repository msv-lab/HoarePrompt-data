Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the minimum number of operations required to move chips so that they form a single block without any free cells (0s) between them. The program first removes leading and trailing zeros from the list of cells, then counts the number of zeros remaining in the list, which represents the minimum number of operations needed.

However, the logic to determine the minimum number of operations is flawed. The current implementation simply counts the number of zeros in the trimmed list, which does not accurately represent the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a contiguous block.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the optimal position for the block of chips and calculate the number of moves required to bring all chips to that position. The optimal position for the block of chips is the position where the sum of distances from all chips to that position is minimized. This is typically the median position of the chips. 

Given the constraints, a simpler approach is to consider the leftmost and rightmost positions of the chips and calculate the number of moves required to bring all chips to the leftmost or rightmost position, whichever is smaller.

Here is a corrected version of the program logic:

1. Identify the positions of all chips.
2. Calculate the total number of moves required to bring all chips to the leftmost chip.
3. Calculate the total number of moves required to bring all chips to the rightmost chip.
4. The minimum of the two values is the answer.

The provided program does not implement this logic, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
