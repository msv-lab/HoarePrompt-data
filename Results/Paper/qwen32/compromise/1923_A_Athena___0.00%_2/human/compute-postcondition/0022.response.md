The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. The initial value of `res` is 0, so after the execution of this line, `res` becomes 1. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and the current value of `a[i]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with all leading zeros and trailing zeros removed and must have at least 1 element; `res` is 1; `i` is 0; the current value of `a[i]` is 0**.
