The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `i` is not adjusted, `res` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, and the current element at index `i` of `a` is 0.**
