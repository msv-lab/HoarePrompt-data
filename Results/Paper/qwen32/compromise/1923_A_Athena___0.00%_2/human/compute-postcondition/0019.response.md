To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. This variable represents the number of test cases, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` is an input integer. This variable likely represents the number of elements in the list `a`, but it is not used in the provided code snippet either.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with all leading zeros and trailing zeros removed. This means that if the input list had leading and/or trailing zeros, they have been removed in the list `a`.
- `res` is initialized to 0. This variable is not used in the provided code snippet.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(a)
```

Since `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with all leading zeros and trailing zeros removed, the exact content of `a` depends on the input provided. However, based on the initial state, we know that `a` will be a list of integers with no leading or trailing zeros.

Therefore, the output will be this list `a`.

Output: **a (where a is a list of integers derived from the input with all leading zeros and trailing zeros removed)**
