Output State: **`a` is a list with the last element removed**

Explanation: The `pop()` method removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the initial state mentioned that the last element was already removed and `0` was added, executing `a.pop()` will remove the `0` that was added, reverting `a` to its state before the `0` was appended.
