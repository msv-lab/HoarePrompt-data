Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with all leading zeros and trailing zeros removed; `res` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `a` will have all the trailing zeros removed from the list derived from the input, while `t`, `n`, and `res` will remain unchanged.
