The code snippet creates a new variable `vis` and assigns it an empty set. This does not affect the values of `arr`, `nums`, or `start`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < n, and the length of `arr` is `n`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of each integer in `arr`; `start` is 0; `vis` is an empty set.**
