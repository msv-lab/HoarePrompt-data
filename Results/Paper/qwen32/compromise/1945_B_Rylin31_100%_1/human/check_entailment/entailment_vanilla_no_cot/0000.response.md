Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The logic used in the function does not account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods or the correct intervals at which fireworks are launched.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within a certain period and then find the maximum overlap of their visibility periods. The period to consider should be the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, because within this period, the pattern of fireworks launches will repeat.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    def lcm(x, y):
        return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        period = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 0
        
        # Count fireworks from the first installation
        for start in range(0, period, a):
            end = start + m
            count = (end // b) - (start // b)
            if start % b == 0:
                count += 1
            max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, count)
        
        # Count fireworks from the second installation
        for start in range(0, period, b):
            end = start + m
            count = (end // a) - (start // a)
            if start % a == 0:
                count += 1
            max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, count)
        
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This program calculates the least common multiple of `a` and `b` to determine the repeating period. It then counts the number of fireworks from each installation within this period and checks for overlaps in their visibility periods to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
