You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it computes a list of integers based on specific operations involving `k` and prints the length of this list followed by the list itself. The list is constructed by manipulating powers of two and the value of `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **No subsequence of `a` should sum to `k`.**
2. **For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.**
3. **The sequence `a` should have a size of at most 25.**

### Program Analysis:
The program creates a sequence `nums` based on powers of 2 (up to `2^23`), which is a common strategy to ensure that all sums up to a certain point can be achieved by selecting subsequences. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23]`.
   - This list ensures that any sum up to `2^24 - 1` can be achieved by selecting a subsequence of these numbers.

2. **Adjusting for `k`:**
   - It calculates the position `idx` of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It then removes the element `2^idx` from the list.
   - It adds three new elements to the list:
     - `k - 2^idx`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be achieved.
     - `k + 1`: Ensures that the next integer can be achieved.
     - `k + 2^idx + 1`: Ensures that there is a way to achieve sums that would otherwise be blocked by the removal of `2^idx`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the list `nums` and the elements of the list.

### Verification:
- **Sum to `k`:** The program ensures that `k` cannot be achieved by removing `2^idx` and adding `k - 2^idx`.
- **Sum to `v` (where `v ≠ k`):** The presence of all powers of 2 up to `2^23` ensures that any sum up to `2^24 - 1` can be achieved, except for `k` due to the specific adjustments made.
- **Size of the sequence:** The sequence is initially of size 24 (powers of 2 up to `2^23`), and three additional elements are added, making the maximum size 27. However, the program actually removes one element (`2^idx`), resulting in a maximum size of 26, which is within the allowable limit of 25.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the requirements of the problem statement. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums up to `n` (where `v ≠ k`) to be achieved. The size of the sequence is also within the allowed limit.
