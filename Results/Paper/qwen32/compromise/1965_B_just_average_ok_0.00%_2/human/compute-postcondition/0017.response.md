To determine the output, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). (This variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.)
2. **`n`**: The first integer from the input. (This variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.)
3. **`k`**: An integer less than 16777216. (The exact value of `k` is not provided, but we know it is used in the construction of the `nums` list.)
4. **`nums`**: A list of integers constructed as follows:
   - The first 23 elements are powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) to \(2^{22}\).
   - The 24th element is `k - 4194304`.
   - The 25th element is `k + 1`.
   - The 26th element is `k + 4194305`.
5. **`idx`**: An integer with the value 23. (This variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.)

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*nums)
```

### Calculation of `nums`:
The `nums` list is constructed as follows:
- The first 23 elements are: \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304]\)
- The 24th element is `k - 4194304`.
- The 25th element is `k + 1`.
- The 26th element is `k + 4194305`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we will represent the last three elements in terms of `k`.

### Output:
The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements of the `nums` list separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2097152 4194304 k - 4194304 k + 1 k + 4194305 (where k is an integer less than 16777216)**
