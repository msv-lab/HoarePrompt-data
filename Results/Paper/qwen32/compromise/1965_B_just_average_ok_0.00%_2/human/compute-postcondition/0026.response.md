The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`, so we can only adjust these two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 2, which means the condition evaluated to `k >= 1 << 2` or `k >= 4`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 4. Since `k` must be at least 2 initially, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 4 to satisfy the condition for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` must be at least 4; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]; `idx` is 2**
