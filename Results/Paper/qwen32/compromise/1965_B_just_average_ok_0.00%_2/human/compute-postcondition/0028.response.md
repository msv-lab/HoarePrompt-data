To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions.

The loop increments `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to `2^idx`). The loop will terminate when `k` is less than `1 << idx`.

Given the initial state and the outputs after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

- After 1 iteration, `idx` is 1, meaning `k` must be at least 1.
- After 2 iterations, `idx` is 2, meaning `k` must be at least 2.
- After 3 iterations, `idx` is 3, meaning `k` must be at least 4.

Following this pattern, the loop will continue to increment `idx` until `k` is less than `1 << idx`. The maximum value of `idx` is determined by the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

Since `nums` is a list of powers of 2 up to `8388608` (which is `2^23`), the maximum possible value of `idx` is 24 (because `1 << 23` is `8388608` and `1 << 24` is `16777216`, which is not in `nums`).

Therefore, the loop will terminate when `idx` is 24 if `k` is at least `8388608`. If `k` is less than `8388608`, `idx` will be the highest value such that `1 << idx` is less than or equal to `k`.

The final output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `k` remains the second integer from the input.
- `nums` remains [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608].
- `idx` will be the highest integer such that `1 << idx` is less than or equal to `k`.

In natural language, the final state means that `idx` will be the position in the list `nums` corresponding to the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; n is the first integer from the input; k is the second integer from the input; nums is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]; idx is the highest integer such that 1 << idx is less than or equal to k.**
