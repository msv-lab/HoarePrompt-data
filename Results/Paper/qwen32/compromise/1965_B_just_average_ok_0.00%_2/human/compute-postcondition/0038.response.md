The given code snippet is:
```python
nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
```

This line of code generates a list of integers where each integer is a power of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). Specifically, `nums` will be:
\[ [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608] \]

The initial state mentioned that `nums` was:
\[ [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + 2`] \]
with the element `1 << idx` removed.

After executing the given code snippet, the `nums` list is reassigned and no longer includes the additional elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2`, nor does it have any element removed. The `nums` list is now strictly the list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).

The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `idx` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]**
