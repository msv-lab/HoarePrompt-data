To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior. The loop increments `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to `2^idx`).

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After 1 iteration, `idx` becomes 1, implying `k` must be at least 1.
- After 2 iterations, `idx` becomes 2, implying `k` must be at least 2.
- After 3 iterations, `idx` becomes 3, implying `k` must be at least 4.

Following this pattern, the loop will continue to increment `idx` until `k` is less than `1 << idx`. The maximum possible value of `idx` is determined by the maximum value in the `nums` list, which is `8388608` (which is `2^23`). Therefore, the loop will run until `idx` reaches 24, because `1 << 24` is `16777216`, which is greater than the maximum possible value in `nums`.

Thus, the final state of the loop will be when `idx` is 24, and `k` is less than `16777216`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is less than 16777216, `nums` is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608], `idx` is 24.**

In natural language, after all iterations, the loop will have incremented `idx` to 24, meaning `k` must be less than `16777216`, and all other variables will remain unchanged.
