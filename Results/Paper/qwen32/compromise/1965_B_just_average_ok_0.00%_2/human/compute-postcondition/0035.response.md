To determine what will be printed by the `print(*nums)` statement, we need to understand the construction of the `nums` list based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. This variable doesn't affect the construction of `nums` directly.
2. **`n`**: The first integer from the input.
3. **`k`**: The second integer from the input.
4. **`nums`**: A list constructed as follows:
   - Starts with predefined values: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`.
   - Includes `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2`.
   - The element `1 << idx` is removed from the list.

### Understanding the Construction of `nums`:
- The list starts with powers of 2 up to \(2^{29}\).
- `1 << idx` is a bitwise operation that left-shifts the number 1 by `idx` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{idx}\).
- The element \(2^{idx}\) is removed from the list.
- The list then includes `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2`.

### Determining the Output:
Given that `idx` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume `idx` is some index that will be used to remove an element from the list. Let's denote the removed element as `nums[idx]`.

The `nums` list will look something like this:
\[ [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - nums[idx], k + 1, k + 2] \]
with the element `nums[idx]` removed.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements of the `nums` list, which includes all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{29}\) except for one element \(2^{idx}\), followed by `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2`.

Since `idx` is not specified, we cannot determine which power of 2 is removed. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - nums[idx], k + 1, k + 2 (where nums[idx] is the element 2^idx removed from the list)**
