The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the condition `k >= 1 << idx` must be satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 1, which means that `1 << idx` is `1 << 1` or 2. Therefore, `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

Since `k` must be at least 1 initially and `idx` is 1, we need to ensure that `k` is adjusted to be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be at least 2, `nums` is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608], `idx` is 1**
