The code snippet reads two integers from the input, `n` and `k`. These values replace the previous values of `n` and `k` in the initial state. The other variables, `t` and `a`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 2 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= k <= n; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
