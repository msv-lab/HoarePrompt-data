You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the problem description. Specifically, the logic for handling the swap and calculating the maximum number of wins is flawed.

Here are some potential issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Wins Without Swap:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` is incorrect because it does not stop at the end of the tournament matches (i.e., `n-1` matches). It should iterate only up to `n-1` to simulate the tournament correctly.
   - The condition `if wins >= k:` is incorrect. The variable `wins` should not be compared with `k` directly. Instead, the logic should determine the number of wins based on the actual tournament matches.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Wins With Swap:**
   - The loop `for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):` is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the scenario where the cow is swapped to a different position and then participates in the tournament.
   - The calculation `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` does not correctly account for the number of wins after the swap.

3. **Logic for Swap Position:**
   - The code does not correctly identify the optimal position to swap the cow to maximize its wins. It should consider all possible positions for the swap and calculate the maximum wins for each scenario.

Here is a corrected version of the program to illustrate the correct approach:

```python
def max_wins(n, k, a):
    # Calculate wins without swap
    wins_without_swap = 0
    current_winner = a[k - 1]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i == k - 1:
            continue
        if a[i] < current_winner:
            wins_without_swap += 1
        else:
            break

    # Calculate wins with swap
    max_wins_with_swap = wins_without_swap
    for i in range(n):
        if i == k - 1:
            continue
        current_winner = a[i]
        wins_with_swap = 0
        for j in range(1, n):
            if j == k - 1:
                current_winner = a[i]
            if a[j] < current_winner:
                wins_with_swap += 1
            else:
                break
        if i < k - 1:
            wins_with_swap += 1
        max_wins_with_swap = max(max_wins_with_swap, wins_with_swap)

    return max(max_wins_with_swap, wins_without_swap)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max_wins(n, k, a))
```

This corrected version properly simulates the tournament both with and without the swap and correctly calculates the maximum number of wins for the cow in each scenario.
