Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not appear to implement the logic described in the problem statement. The code includes three functions, but none of them seem to correctly handle the game logic between Alice and Bob:

1. `func_1()` and `func_2()` are supposed to read input, but they use an undefined function `putin()`. Presumably, `putin()` is meant to be `input()`, but even with this correction, these functions do not process the input as described in the problem statement.

2. `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)` takes two arrays as input. However, the function name and its logic do not match the problem's requirements. The function seems to sum up elements from `sec_arr` and then conditionally add sums from `main_ar`, but it does not account for the optimal selection of items by Alice and Bob as described.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Parse the input for each test case.
- For each test case, determine the optimal subset of items Alice should buy to maximize her profit.
- Calculate the profit based on the items Bob takes for free and the items he buys from Alice.

Here is a sketch of what the correct logic should look like:

```python
def calculate_profit(n, k, a, b):
    # Calculate profit for each item if Alice buys it and Bob buys it back
    profit = [(b[i] - a[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    # Sort items by profit in descending order
    profit.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Alice buys the top (n-k) items by profit
    alice_profit = sum(a[i] for _, i in profit[:n-k])
    bob_payment = sum(b[i] for _, i in profit[:n-k])
    
    # Alice's profit is Bob's payment minus her cost
    return bob_payment - alice_profit

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = int(data[index + 1])
    a = list(map(int, data[index + 2:index + 2 + n]))
    b = list(map(int, data[index + 2 + n:index + 2 + 2 * n]))
    index += 2 + 2 * n
    
    result = calculate_profit(n, k, a, b)
    results.append(result)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This code correctly handles the input, calculates the optimal profit for Alice, and outputs the results for each test case. The provided code does not do this, hence it is incorrect.
