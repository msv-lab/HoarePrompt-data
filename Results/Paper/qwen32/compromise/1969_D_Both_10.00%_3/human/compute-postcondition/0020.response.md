Output State: **The program returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of `(a_i + b_i)` for each tuple `(a_i, b_i)` in `main_ar` where `(a_i + b_i) >= 0`.**

This means that the program calculates `sub_summ` based on the specified conditions and returns that value.
