The code snippet adds the first and second elements of the tuple `val_b` to the variable `sub_summ`. Given that `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`, and `main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, we can infer that `val_b` contains two integers.

Let's denote the elements of `val_b` as `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]`. The operation `sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]` means that the current value of `sub_summ` is updated by adding the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]`.

Since the exact values of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]` are not specified, we can only express the new value of `sub_summ` in terms of its previous value and the elements of `val_b`.

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`, `sub_summ` is updated to its previous value plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`.**
