To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the logic of the loop and how the `sub_summ` variable is updated.

The loop iterates over each tuple in `sec_arr`. For each tuple `val_a` in `sec_arr`, the first element of the tuple `val_a[0]` is added to `sub_summ`.

Given the provided outputs for the first three iterations, we can infer that after each iteration, `sub_summ` accumulates the first element of each tuple in `sec_arr`. 

After all iterations, `sub_summ` will be the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.

Let's denote the number of tuples in `sec_arr` as `n`. The final value of `sub_summ` will be the sum of the first elements of all `n` tuples in `sec_arr`.

Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the prices (a_i, b_i) for Alice and Bob respectively for a particular item; `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is that `sub_summ` will hold the total sum of the prices for Alice (the first element of each tuple in `sec_arr`), while `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
