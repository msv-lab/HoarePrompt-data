To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and how it modifies `sub_summ` based on the tuples in `main_ar`.

The loop iterates over each tuple `val_b` in `main_ar`. If the sum of the two integers in `val_b` (i.e., `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`) is greater than or equal to 0, `sub_summ` is incremented by the sum of these two integers.

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `main_ar`: A list of tuples, each containing two integers.
   - `sec_arr`: A list of tuples, each containing two integers.
   - `sub_summ`: The sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each tuple `val_b` in `main_ar`, check if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.
   - If true, add `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `sub_summ` will be the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for all tuples `val_b` in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.

**Output State**: **`sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for all tuples `val_b` in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.**

In simpler terms, `sub_summ` is updated by adding the sum of the two integers in each tuple from `main_ar` if the sum of these integers is non-negative. The state of `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remains unchanged except for the updated `sub_summ`.
