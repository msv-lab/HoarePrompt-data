The only object in the loop head is `val_b`, which is the iteration variable for `main_ar`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in `main_ar`.

Given:
- `main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple.
- `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers.
- `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.
- If the sum of the two integers in the current tuple `val_b` from `sec_arr` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is increased by the sum of the two integers in `val_b`.

Since `main_ar` is the list being iterated over in the for loop, we need to adjust `val_b` to be the next tuple in `main_ar`. The states of `sec_arr` and `sub_summ` are not directly affected by the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted here.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `val_b` was the current tuple from `main_ar`. For the next iteration, `val_b` should be the next tuple in `main_ar`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`, and `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`.**
