The only variable in the loop head is `val_b`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `main_ar` list and the current `val_b` tuple. Since `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`, at the start of the next iteration, `val_b` should be the next tuple in the list after the current `val_b`.

Given that `main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, and we have just finished processing one tuple (`val_b`), the next iteration will process the next tuple in the list. Therefore, `val_b` should be updated to the next tuple in `main_ar`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`**.

Since `sub_summ` and the conditions related to it are calculated within the loop body, they do not affect the state at the start of the next iteration. The only change needed is to update `val_b` to the next tuple in `main_ar`.
