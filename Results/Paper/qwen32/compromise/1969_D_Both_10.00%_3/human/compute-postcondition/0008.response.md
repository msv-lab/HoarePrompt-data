In the given task, the for loop iterates over `main_ar`, which is a list of tuples. The loop will execute if `main_ar` contains at least one tuple. The state of `sec_arr`, `sub_summ`, and the elements within the tuples of `main_ar` and `sec_arr` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute. 

Let's break it down:

- `main_ar`: This is the list that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `main_ar` must contain at least one tuple.
- `val_b`: This is the loop variable that takes on the value of each tuple in `main_ar` during each iteration. Before the loop starts, `val_b` does not need to be defined, as it will be assigned the first tuple of `main_ar` during the first iteration.
- `sec_arr` and `sub_summ`: These variables are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop will execute. They can remain as they are.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `main_ar` to ensure that it contains at least one tuple.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`**.
