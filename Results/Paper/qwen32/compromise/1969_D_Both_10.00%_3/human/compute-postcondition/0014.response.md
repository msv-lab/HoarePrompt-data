Postcondition: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, then `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the first and second elements of `val_b`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` remains the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`. `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`.**
