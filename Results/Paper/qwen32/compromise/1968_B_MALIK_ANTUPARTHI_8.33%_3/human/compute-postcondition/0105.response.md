Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then processes these strings and prints an integer `k` for each test case, which is determined based on the comparison of characters in the strings.**
