The code snippet `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. This means the previous value of `k` is no longer relevant.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user's input; `k` is `j + 1`; the character `d[j]` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`. Additionally, either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.**
