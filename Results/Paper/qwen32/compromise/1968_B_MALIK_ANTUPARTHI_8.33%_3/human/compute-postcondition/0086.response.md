The code snippet `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` finds the index of the character `d[j]` in the string `e` and adds 1 to it. Given the initial state, `j` is 5, so the character `d[5]` is used to find its index in `e`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is the first integer from the user's input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 4, `j` is 5, `k` is the index of `d[5]` in `e` plus 1.**
