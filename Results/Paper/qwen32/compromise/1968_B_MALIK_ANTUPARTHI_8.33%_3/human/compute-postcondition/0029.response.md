Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user's input; `j` is incremented by 1 and points to the next character in `d`; `k` is the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
