The code snippet `b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `b` and `c` respectively. 

Given the initial state, `b` was originally a binary string of length `m`, and `c` was not defined. After the execution of the code, `b` is reassigned to an integer value, and `c` is assigned a new integer value from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer; `c` is an integer.**
