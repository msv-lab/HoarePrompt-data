Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is the first integer from the user's input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 4, `j` is 4, and `k` is the one-based index of the character at `d[4]` in the string `e`. If the condition (k == c or j == b - 1) is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes occur.**
