The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decremented by `n-1` from the previous state, `n` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, and `max` is the maximum value among the minimums of consecutive elements in `a`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. Since `t` was decremented by `n-1` in the previous iteration, we need to increment `t` by `n-1` to return it to its state before the decrement, and then decrement it by 1 to reflect the start of the new iteration.

Therefore, `t` should be incremented by `n-1` and then decremented by 1, which means `t` should be incremented by `n-2`.

State: **`t` is incremented by `n-2`, `n` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, and `max` is the maximum value among the minimums of consecutive elements in `a`**.
