Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to partition strings that contain palindromic substrings into non-palindromic parts. Let's analyze a few cases:

### Case 1: Palindromic Substrings
Consider the input string "abccba". The program will incorrectly output "NO" because it only checks for the entire string being a palindrome, not for palindromic substrings within the string.

### Case 2: Strings with Repeated Characters
Consider the input string "abababa". The program might incorrectly output "NO" because it does not correctly identify that the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings such as "ab", "ab", "aba".

### Case 3: Strings with Mixed Patterns
Consider the input string "aabbaa". The program might incorrectly output "NO" because it does not correctly identify that the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings such as "aab", "baa" or "aa", "b", "baa".

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that each substring in the partition is not a palindrome. Here's a revised approach:

1. If the string length is 1, output "NO" because a single character is a palindrome.
2. If the string contains at least two different characters, output "YES" and partition the string into substrings of at least two characters that are not palindromes.
3. If the string consists of only one character repeated, output "NO".

Here's a correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        s = list(string)
        n = len(s)
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        if len(set(s)) == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        print('YES')
        # Partition the string into non-palindromic parts
        # For simplicity, we can partition it into pairs of characters
        # which are guaranteed to not be palindromic if there are at least two different characters
        parts = []
        j = 0
        while j < n:
            if j + 1 < n:
                parts.append(string[j:j+2])
                j += 2
            else:
                parts.append(string[j])
                j += 1
        print(len(parts))
        print(" ".join(parts))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This implementation ensures that the string is partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes, handling all edge cases correctly.
