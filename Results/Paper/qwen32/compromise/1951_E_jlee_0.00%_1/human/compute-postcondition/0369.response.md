Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the new user input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `string`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, taking into account the conditions and changes described in the if part and the lack of an else part.
