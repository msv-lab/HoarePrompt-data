Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `s[j]` is not equal to `x`; `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`; `count2` equals `count`; `i` is `i + 1`. `count` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, indicating that there was at most one character in `s` different from `x` and `count` was set to the index of that character.**
