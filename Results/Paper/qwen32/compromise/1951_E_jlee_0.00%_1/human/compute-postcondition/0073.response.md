Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`. If all characters in `s` are the same as `x`, then `s.count(x) == n`. Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even or the middle character of `s` (if `n` is odd) is equal to `x`. If `count2 == count`, then `done` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2 > count`, then `done` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. `count2` is either equal to `count` or greater than `count`. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count` is 1 or less.**
