Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string` with `n` being at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `count` is greater than 0; `i` is the value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again; if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` is True and `count2` is either 0, greater than 0 and less than `count`, or equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1; if `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `done` remains False and `count2` is set to 1.**
