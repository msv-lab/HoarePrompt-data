The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about various variables such as `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, and `i`, but these variables do not affect the `print` statement in any way. The `print` statement is a simple output statement that does not depend on any of the variables or their values.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
