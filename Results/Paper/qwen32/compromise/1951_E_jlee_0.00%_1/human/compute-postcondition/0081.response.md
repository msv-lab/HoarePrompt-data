The `print(1)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Here's the step-by-step explanation:
1. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`), but these are not used in the `print(1)` statement.
2. The `print(1)` statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **1**
