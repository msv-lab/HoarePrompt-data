Postcondition: **t is greater than 0; string is the new user input; s is a list of characters from the new string; n is the length of the new s; x is the first character of the new string; done is False; count is 0 or updated based on conditions; count2 is 0 or updated based on conditions; i is the value that allows the loop to check the condition i < t again; the current value of done is False.** 

Since the else part does not exist and the if condition `not done` is true (as per the given precondition where done is False), the postcondition is the same as the precondition with the additional information that the current value of done remains False.
