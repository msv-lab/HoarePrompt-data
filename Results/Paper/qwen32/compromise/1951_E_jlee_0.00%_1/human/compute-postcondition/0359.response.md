Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `count` is greater than 0, indicating that there was a character in `s` different from `x` and `count` was set to the index of that character. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is 0 if `count` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, or `count2` equals `count` if `count` is greater than 1. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is 1.**
