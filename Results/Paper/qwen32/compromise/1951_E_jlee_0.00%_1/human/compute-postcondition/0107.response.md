Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and must be less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `count2` equals `count`, then `count2` is set to 0. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to `j`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains as per the precondition without any changes to `done`.**
