Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the new user input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `string`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, and `j` is `j + 1`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, or `count2` does not equal `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged, and the variables `i`, `j`, `count`, and `count2` retain their previous values.**
