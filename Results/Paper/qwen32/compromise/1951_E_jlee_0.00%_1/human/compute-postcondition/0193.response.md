Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string` with `n` being at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `count` is greater than 0; `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`; `i` is the value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again; `done` is True; `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
