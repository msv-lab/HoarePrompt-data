The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program flow. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`) are affected.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and the current value of `n` is 1; `done` is False.**
