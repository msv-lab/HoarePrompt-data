The given `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(2)`. This statement will output the integer `2` regardless of the values of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `string`, `s`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, `done`, `s[j]`) and their conditions or relationships, but none of these variables affect the `print(2)` statement.
2. The `print(2)` statement is a direct print of the integer `2`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **2**
