The given `print` statement is `print(1)`. This statement will print the integer `1` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `done` as described in the initial state. The initial state provides information about the conditions and values of these variables but does not affect the output of the `print(1)` statement.

Output: **1**
