The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop counter and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so we do not need to adjust it before the loop starts.

Given the provided state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is controlled by the loop itself.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
