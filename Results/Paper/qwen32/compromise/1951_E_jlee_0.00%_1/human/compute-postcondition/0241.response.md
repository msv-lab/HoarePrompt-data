Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string` with `n` being at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `i` is the value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again; `j` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains False and the loop continues. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to `j`; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. If `count` is greater than 1, `count2` remains unchanged; otherwise, `count2` is set to 0 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, or `count2` is set to 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `x`.**
