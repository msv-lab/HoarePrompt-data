Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the new user input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `string`, `j` is `j + 1`. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is set to 0 if `count2` was equal to `count` or `count` was greater than 1; otherwise, `count2` retains its previous value. `done` is set to True if `count2` is greater than `count` or `count` is greater than 1; otherwise, `done` retains its previous value. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1, and `count` and `done` retain their previous values. If `count` is not greater than 0, the conditions for `count2` and `done` remain unchanged.**
