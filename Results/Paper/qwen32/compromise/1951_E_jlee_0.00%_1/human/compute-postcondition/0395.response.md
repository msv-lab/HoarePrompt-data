The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, `done`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of these variables and simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
