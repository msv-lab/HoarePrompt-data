Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the new user input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `string`, `j` is `j + 1`, `count` retains its previous value, `count2` is 0 if `count` is not greater than 1, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `done` retains its previous value unless `count` is greater than 1, in which case it becomes True.**
