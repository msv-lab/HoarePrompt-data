Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is set to 0 if `count` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, or `count2` equals `count` if `count` is greater than 1. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is 1. If `count` is 0, `count2` retains its original value of 0.**
