Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least two friends come to the party. A friend i will come to the party if both friend i and friend p_i (i's best friend) receive invitations.

### Program Analysis

The provided program has the following structure:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
3. `func_1` performs the following:
   - Reads the number of friends `n`.
   - Reads the list `p` of best friends and stores it in a list `v` with an extra 0 at the beginning (which is unused).
   - It then iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `v[v[i]] == i`. If true, it prints `2` and exits the function.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a pair, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Analysis

The logic of the program is based on the following observations:
- If there is a pair of friends `i` and `p_i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`, then sending invitations to both `i` and `p_i` will ensure that both come to the party. This is because for these two friends, each one's best friend is the other, and sending an invitation to each will satisfy the condition for both to come.
- If no such pair exists, then Monocarp needs to invite at least 3 friends to ensure that at least two of them come to the party. This is because with only two invitations, it's possible that the two invited friends are not best friends of each other, and thus, only one might come (if the other's best friend wasn't invited).

### Example Verification

Let's verify the provided examples with the program's logic:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
   - The pair (4, 5) satisfies `v[v[4]] == 4` (since `v[4] = 5` and `v[5] = 4`).
   - The program correctly outputs `2`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 4`, `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
   - There is no pair (i, p_i) such that `v[v[i]] == i`.
   - The program correctly outputs `3`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 2`, `p = [2, 1]`
   - The pair (1, 2) satisfies `v[v[1]] == 1` (since `v[1] = 2` and `v[2] = 1`).
   - The program correctly outputs `2`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of invitations needed based on the problem description and the examples provided.

**Correctness: True**
