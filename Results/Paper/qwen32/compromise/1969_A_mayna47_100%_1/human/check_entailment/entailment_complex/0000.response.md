### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. Friends come to the party if both they and their best friend receive invitations.

The provided program follows a specific logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `p` of best friends.
3. It checks if there exists any `i` such that `p[p[i]] == i`. If such an `i` exists, it prints `2` and exits. Otherwise, it prints `3`.

#### Analysis:
- **Case when `p[p[i]] == i`:** This means that `i` and `p[i]` are best friends of each other. If Monocarp sends invitations to both `i` and `p[i]`, then both will come to the party. Hence, the minimum number of invitations needed is `2`.
- **Case when `p[p[i]] != i` for all `i`:** This means that no two friends are best friends of each other in a mutual way. In this scenario, Monocarp needs to invite at least `3` friends to ensure that at least `2` of them come to the party. This is because if he invites `2` friends who are not best friends of each other, only one of them will come to the party. Hence, the minimum number of invitations needed is `3`.

The logic in the program correctly identifies these two scenarios and outputs the appropriate minimum number of invitations.
