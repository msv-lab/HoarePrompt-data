The code snippet `v = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`. This means that the list `v` will have `n + 1` positions, from index `0` to index `n`, and each position will contain the value `0`.

The other variables `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged by this code snippet. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is the input integer, and `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` is between 1 and `n` and `p_i` is not equal to `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all set to 0.**
