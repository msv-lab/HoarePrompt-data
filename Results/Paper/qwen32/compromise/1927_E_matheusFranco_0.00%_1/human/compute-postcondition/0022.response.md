To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. 

Given:
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initialized to 1.
- `i` is initialized to 1.

The loop condition requires `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to be less than the length of `permutation`, which is `n`.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1.
- The length of `permutation` is `n`.

For the loop to execute, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which is 1) must be less than `n`. Since `n` is given to be at least 2 (`2 <= k <= n`), the condition `1 < n` is already satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, and 0 elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1; `i` is 1**
