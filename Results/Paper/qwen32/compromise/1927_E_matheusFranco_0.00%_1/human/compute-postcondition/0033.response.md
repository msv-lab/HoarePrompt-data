The code snippet increments the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Given the initial state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially `2k + 1`. After adding `k` to it, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `2k + 1 + k`, which simplifies to `3k + 1`.

None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `n` must be greater than `2k + 1`; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, `floor(n/k) + 2` at position `k + 1`, `floor(n/k) + 3` at position `2k + 1`, and 0 elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 4`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `3k + 1`; `i` is 1.**
