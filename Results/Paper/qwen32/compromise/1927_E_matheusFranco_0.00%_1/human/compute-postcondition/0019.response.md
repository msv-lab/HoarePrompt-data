To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses based on the given conditions and outputs after the first three iterations.

### Analysis:
- The loop increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k` in each iteration.
- It assigns the current value of `curr_v` to the position `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list.
- `curr_v` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop continues until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than the length of the `permutation` list (`n`).

### Given Information:
- `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n`.
- After 3 iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 6, and `n` must be greater than 4.

### Final Iteration Condition:
- The loop stops when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is equal to or greater than `n`.
- Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at `i` (which is 0) and increments by `k` each time, the last valid index it can assign to is the largest multiple of `k` that is less than `n`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 10` and `k = 2` for simplicity:
- Initial state: `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 0`, `curr_v = 1`
- Iteration 1: `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 0`, `permutation[0] = 1`, `curr_v = 2`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 2`
- Iteration 2: `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 2`, `permutation[2] = 2`, `curr_v = 3`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 4`
- Iteration 3: `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 4`, `permutation[4] = 3`, `curr_v = 4`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 6`
- Iteration 4: `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 6`, `permutation[6] = 4`, `curr_v = 5`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 8`
- Iteration 5: `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 8`, `permutation[8] = 5`, `curr_v = 6`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 10`

At this point, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is equal to `n`, so the loop terminates.

### General Case:
For any `n` and `k` where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even, the loop will terminate when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches `n`. The `permutation` list will have values assigned at every `k`-th position starting from 0, and `curr_v` will be one more than the number of iterations.

### Final Output State:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `n`.
- `curr_v` will be `floor(n/k) + 1` because it increments once per iteration.
- The `permutation` list will have values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`.

### Conclusion:
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, and 0 elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, the final state will have the `permutation` list filled with sequential numbers starting from 1 at every `k`-th position, and the rest of the elements will be 0. The loop counter `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `n`, and `curr_v` will be one more than the number of non-zero elements in the `permutation` list.
