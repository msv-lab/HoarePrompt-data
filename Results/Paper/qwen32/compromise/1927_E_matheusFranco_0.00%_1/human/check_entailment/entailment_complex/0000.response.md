### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify whether it constructs a k-level permutation for each test case as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the program and analyze its logic:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Purpose:** Generate a k-level permutation of length `n` based on the given `k`.
   - **Logic:**
     - Initialize a permutation list of size `n` with zeros.
     - Iterate over each index `i` from `0` to `k-1`.
     - For each `i`, fill the permutation list at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` with consecutive integers starting from `1`.
     - This ensures that every `k`-th segment of the permutation has a similar sum because the numbers are distributed evenly across these segments.
   - **Output:** Prints the generated permutation as a space-separated string.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Purpose:** Handle multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Logic:**
     - Read the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, call `func_1` to generate and print the required permutation.
   - **Output:** None, but it indirectly outputs the results of each test case by calling `func_1`.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Pattern of Distribution:** The key aspect of the solution is how the numbers are distributed across the permutation. By filling every `k`-th position starting from each index `i` from `0` to `k-1`, the function ensures that the sums of all `k`-length segments are as close as possible.
- **Sum Differences:** Since the numbers are distributed evenly, the sums of any two `k`-length segments will differ by at most `1`. This is because the difference in sums would only occur due to the placement of the largest numbers in one segment versus another, but the distribution pattern minimizes this difference.
- **Edge Cases:** The function handles edge cases such as `n = k` and `n >> k` correctly by ensuring that the entire permutation is filled in a manner that respects the k-level condition.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly generates a k-level permutation for each test case as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
