To determine if the given program correctly constructs a k-level permutation as described in the problem, we need to analyze the logic implemented in `func_1` and ensure it meets the criteria for a k-level permutation.

### Analysis of `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - A list `permutation` of length `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - Variables `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` are initialized to 0, 1, and 1 respectively. However, `idx` and `idx_v` are not used in the function.

2. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starting from `i` and increments it by `k` in each iteration until it exceeds the length of `permutation`.
   - In each iteration, it assigns the current value of `curr_v` to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` and then increments `curr_v`.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation is converted to a string and printed.

### Checking the k-Level Condition:

- The goal is to ensure that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
- The current implementation fills the permutation in a pattern where every `k`-th position is filled sequentially with increasing values.
- This pattern does not guarantee that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` will differ by no more than 1.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the output of the function with one of the examples:

**Example Input**:
```
2 2
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2 1
```

**Actual Output from `func_1`**:
```
1 2
```

This output is incorrect because the sums of the segments of length 2 are 3 and 2, which differ by more than 1.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly construct a k-level permutation as per the problem requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
