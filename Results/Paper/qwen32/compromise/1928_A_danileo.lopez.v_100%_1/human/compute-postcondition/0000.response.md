The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. After executing the given code, the value of `t` is updated to the integer value read from the input, while the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not mentioned in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value read from the input, 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.**
