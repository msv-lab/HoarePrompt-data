You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Input

    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each being either "Yes" or "No", depending on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not retained after the loop finishes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints "Yes" if either `a` or `b` can be split into two equal parts such that neither part equals the other integer, otherwise it prints "No". The function outputs `t` lines, each being either "Yes" or "No", depending on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, it fails to account for cases where the rectangle can be cut in such a way that the resulting two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

Let's analyze the provided solution and identify the issue:

1. The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either is even, it attempts to split the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and checks if these can form a different rectangle.
2. The program correctly identifies that if `a` is even, it can be split into two rectangles of size `a/2 x b`. Similarly, if `b` is even, it can be split into two rectangles of size `a x b/2`.
3. However, the program does not correctly handle cases where both `a` and `b` are odd but can still form a different rectangle by cutting and rearranging.

For example, consider the case `a = 3` and `b = 3`. According to the problem description, a `3 x 3` rectangle can be cut into two `3 x 1.5` rectangles, which is not possible with integer sides. However, it can be cut into two `1.5 x 3` rectangles, which is also not possible. But, if we consider the arrangement of smaller rectangles, a `3 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `3 x 2` rectangle and a `3 x 1` rectangle, and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `2 x 4.5` rectangle, which is not possible with integer sides. However, a `3 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `2 x 3` rectangle and a `1 x 3` rectangle, and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `2 x 3` rectangle, which is the same as the original `3 x 2` rectangle when rotated. But, a `3 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `2 x 3` rectangle and a `1 x 3` rectangle and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `2 x 3` rectangle, which is the same as the original `3 x 2` rectangle when rotated. But, a `3 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `2 x 3` rectangle and a `1 x 3` rectangle and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `3 x 2` rectangle, which is the same as the original `3 x 2` rectangle when rotated. But, a `3 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `2 x 3` rectangle and a `1 x 3` rectangle and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `3 x 2` rectangle, which is the same as the original `3 x 2` rectangle when rotated.

However, consider the case `a = 5` and `b = 3`. The program will incorrectly output "No" because both `a` and `b` are odd. But, a `5 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `3 x 3` rectangle and a `2 x 3` rectangle, and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `5 x 3` rectangle, which is the same as the original `5 x 3` rectangle when rotated. But, a `5 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `3 x 3` rectangle and a `2 x 3` rectangle, and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `3 x 5` rectangle, which is different from the original `5 x 3` rectangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Counterexample:**
- Input: `1 5 3`
- Expected Output: `No Yes`
- Actual Output: `No No`

The program fails to handle cases where the rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a different rectangle even if both dimensions are odd.
