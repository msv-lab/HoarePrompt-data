Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not cover all the cases correctly. The logic is incorrect because it only checks if one of the sides is even and then checks if the resulting halves can form a different rectangle. However, there are cases where the rectangle can be cut into two parts and reassembled into a different rectangle even if neither side is even.

For example, consider a rectangle of size 6x3. It can be cut into two rectangles of size 3x3, and then these two 3x3 rectangles can be placed side by side to form a 6x3 rectangle, which is the same as the original. But it can also be cut into a 3x2 and a 3x1, and then these can be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original.

The correct solution should check if either of the sides is even, or if both sides are the same (which would mean it cannot form a different rectangle). The current program does not handle the case where both sides are the same and both are odd correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif a != b:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version handles all the cases correctly.
