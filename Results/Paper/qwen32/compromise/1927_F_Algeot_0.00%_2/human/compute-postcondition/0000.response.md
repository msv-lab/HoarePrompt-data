The given code snippet only sets the recursion limit using `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, or `w` as these variables are not modified by this line of code. The recursion limit is increased to 1,000,000 which is a system-level setting and does not change the state of the input variables or any other variables in the program.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min((n*(n - 1))//2, 2 * 10^5); Each edge is represented by three integers u, v, and w, where 1 <= u, v <= n, u != v, and 1 <= w <= 10^6; The recursion limit is set to 1,000,000.**
