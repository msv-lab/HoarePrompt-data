Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
- Bob must set up at most 60 stalls.
- Each stall can have an integer price per jewel between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from each stall, moving to the next in sequence.
- The goal is to make Alice buy exactly \(k\) jewels.

### Code Analysis:
The code provided is incomplete and incorrect for the given problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of \(n\) (coins) and \(k\) (jewels).
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case. However, the function's logic is flawed and does not correctly solve the problem.
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code correctly handles the case where \(n = k\) by setting up a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - The code correctly handles the case where \(n < k\) by printing "NO" because Alice cannot buy \(k\) jewels if she has fewer coins than jewels.
   
4. **General Case:**
   - The code attempts to set up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and checks if the total number of jewels bought is at least \(k\).
   - This approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly \(k\) jewels, and it does not consider setting up more than two stalls or using different prices to achieve the goal.

### Issues:
- The logic for setting up stalls and determining prices is incorrect.
- The code does not ensure that Alice buys exactly \(k\) jewels.
- The code does not utilize the constraint that there can be at most 60 stalls effectively.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, Bob can set up stalls in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly \(k\) jewels. One possible strategy is to use binary representation of \(k\) to determine the number of stalls and their prices. For example, if \(k = 13\), which is \(1101_2\), Bob can set up stalls with prices such that Alice buys 8, 4, and 1 jewels from three stalls respectively.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly \(k\) jewels and does not make effective use of the 60-stall constraint.

**Correctness: False**
