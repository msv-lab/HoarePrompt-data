Let's analyze the given task step by step:

- **Initial State**: The initial state tells us that `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraint \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). Additionally, it is explicitly stated that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

- **Code Snippet**: The code snippet contains a single `print` statement:
  ```python
  print(1)
  ```

- **Analysis**:
  - The `print` statement is printing the integer `1`.
  - The values of `n` and `k` are not directly used in the `print` statement. The statement `print(1)` simply outputs the number `1` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

- **Output**:
  - Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output the number `1`, the output will be `1`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **1**
