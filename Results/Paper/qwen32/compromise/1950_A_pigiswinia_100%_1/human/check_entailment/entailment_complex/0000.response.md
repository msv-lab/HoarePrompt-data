### Reasoning:
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, each time reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each set of integers, it checks:
- If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
- If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
- Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

These conditions align exactly with the problem description provided. The program correctly identifies whether the input digits form a stair, a peak, or neither and prints the corresponding output for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
