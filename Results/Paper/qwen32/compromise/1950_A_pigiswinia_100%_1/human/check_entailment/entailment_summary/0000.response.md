Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. The program then checks:

1. If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
2. If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected for each test case, matching the conditions and outputs specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
