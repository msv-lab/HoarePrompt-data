Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 36, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, `i` is 7, `l` is a list containing the single element `ans`.**

The list `l` is now initialized with a single element, which is the value of `ans`. All other variables retain their initial values.
