The code snippet provided sets the variable `ans` to 1. This change impacts the initial state by updating the value of `ans`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer provided by the input, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and `ans` is 1.**
