Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` divides `x` evenly, and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. `l` is a list containing the values [1, i] since `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
