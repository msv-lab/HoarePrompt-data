Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer provided by the input, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`.**

In natural language, the output state means that `t` remains the same integer within the specified range, `x` and `n` retain their input values with `n` still being less than or equal to `x`, and a new variable `k` is introduced which holds the result of the integer division of `x` by `n`.
