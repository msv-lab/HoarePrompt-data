Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is x // n, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, and `i` is 5. If `x % 5 == 0`, then `l` is updated to `[ans, 5, x // 5]` if `x // 5` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is updated to `[ans, x // 5]`. If `x % 5 != 0`, `l` remains unchanged.**
