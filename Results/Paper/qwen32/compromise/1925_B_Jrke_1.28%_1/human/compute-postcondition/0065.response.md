The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `l` initially contains the value of `ans`, after appending `i`, `l` will have two elements: the original `ans` and the new value `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is incremented by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration and is still less than `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` and `i`.**
