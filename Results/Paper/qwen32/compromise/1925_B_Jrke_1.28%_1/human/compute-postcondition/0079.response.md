The provided code snippet sets `ans` to 1. This does not change the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, or `k`, but it does update the value of `ans` as specified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer provided by the input, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is 1.**
