Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards. Each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times in the sequence. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided output description.**
