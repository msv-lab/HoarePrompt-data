Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program seems to be counting the number of times each card appears in the player's hand and then dividing by 3, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. The given program does not simulate the game or consider the optimal moves for either player.

Let's consider the first test case from the problem description:

Input:
```
4
1 1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

The provided program would not produce the correct output for this test case. It would likely not even produce a valid output since it is not correctly implementing the game logic.

Here is a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:
- The program does not simulate the game turns.
- It does not account for the fact that Nene plays optimally.
- The logic of counting elements and dividing by 3 is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem's requirements.
