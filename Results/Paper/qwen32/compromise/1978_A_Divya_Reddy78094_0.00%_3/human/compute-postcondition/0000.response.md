The code snippet provided is:
```python
t = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. Since the code is reading a new value for `t` from the input, the value of `t` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the input. The other variables (`n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged as they are not mentioned in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input value such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
