The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted as it is not used in the loop body. The loop will execute `t` times, so the state of `t` is the only one we need to ensure is correct for the loop to execute.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer input value such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, no adjustment is actually needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. However, to adhere to the format requested, we can state that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9**
