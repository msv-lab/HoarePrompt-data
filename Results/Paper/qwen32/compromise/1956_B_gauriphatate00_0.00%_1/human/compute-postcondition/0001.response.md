The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. However, the code does not modify `n` or `a`, but it introduces a new variable `data` which holds the split input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards you and Nene each receive, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace.**
