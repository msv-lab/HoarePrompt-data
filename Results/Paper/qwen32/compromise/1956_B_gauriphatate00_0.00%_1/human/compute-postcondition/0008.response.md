To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `results`, so we need to ensure that `results` is in a state that allows the loop to execute.

Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop iterates over `results`. Therefore, the state of `results` is the only thing we can adjust to ensure the loop executes.

2. **Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. If `results` is an empty list, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjustments**: We need to ensure that `results` has at least one element. Since `results` is derived from `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, we can assume that `func_1` returns a non-empty list for the loop to execute.

Given this, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `results` is a non-empty list. We don't need to adjust `n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, or `t` because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is the number of cards from the last iteration, `a` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` is the same list of substrings, `idx` is incremented by `1 + sum(n for each iteration) + t`, `t` is unchanged, `results` is a non-empty list**

This ensures that the loop can execute as the loop head depends only on `results`.
