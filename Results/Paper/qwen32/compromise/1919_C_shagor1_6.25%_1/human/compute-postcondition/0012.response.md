The provided code snippet contains the expression `x == y`, which is a comparison operation. However, it does not assign the result to any variable or perform any action based on the comparison. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `inp`, `ans`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `inp` is a tuple of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, and `a` is greater than `y`.**
