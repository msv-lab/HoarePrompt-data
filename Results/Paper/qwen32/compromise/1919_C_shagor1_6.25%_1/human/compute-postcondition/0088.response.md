The value of `x` is set to the value of `a`, which is the next element in the list `inp`. The other variables (`y`, `ans`, `n`, and `inp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the next element in `inp`, `x` is the next element in `inp`, `y` will be recalculated based on the new value of `a`, `ans` will be recalculated based on the new value of `a`, `n` is the input integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.**
