The code snippet takes multiple integers as input, splits them, and maps each to an integer, storing them in the variable `inp` as a tuple. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer provided by the user, which indicates the number of integers expected in the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5); `inp` is a tuple of integers as provided by the user.**

In natural language, this means that `n` retains its value as a positive integer within the specified range, and `inp` now holds the tuple of integers that were input by the user, split and converted to integers.
