Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `inp` is a tuple of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is set to 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `x` (where `x` is `n`) or if `a` is less than or equal to `y` (where `y` is `n`). Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1. `a` is the next element in `inp`. `x` is equal to `a`.**

Natural Language: The value of `x` is now set to the value of `a`, which is the next element in the tuple `inp`. The values of `n`, `inp`, `ans`, and `a` remain unchanged otherwise.
