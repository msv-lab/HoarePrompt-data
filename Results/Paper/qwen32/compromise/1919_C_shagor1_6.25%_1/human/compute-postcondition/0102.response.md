Postcondition: **`a` is the next element in `inp`, `n` retains its previous value, `inp` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is assigned the value of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is equal to `a`, and if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `y` is set to `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
