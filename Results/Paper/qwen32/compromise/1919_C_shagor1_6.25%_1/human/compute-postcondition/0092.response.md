The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `a`, `y`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the next element in `inp`; `y` is the next element in `inp`; `x` retains its previous value; `n` retains its previous value; `ans` is its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`a` is the next element in `inp`; `y` is the next element in `inp`; `x` retains its previous value; `n` retains its previous value; `ans` is its previous value plus 1.**
