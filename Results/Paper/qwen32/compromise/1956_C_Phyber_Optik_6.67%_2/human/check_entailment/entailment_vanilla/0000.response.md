Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with zeroes by performing operations of two types:

1. Type 1: Choose a row and assign a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \) to that row.
2. Type 2: Choose a column and assign a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \) to that column.

The maximum possible sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \), which is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times (once for each row or column).

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \). It then calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations to achieve this sum.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Program

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).

2. **Calculating Maximum Sum:**
   - The program initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to \( n \) (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if \( n \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \) is greater than \( i \times n \).
     - If true, it sets `r` to the current index \( i \) and adds \( n \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \) to `sum`.
     - Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to `sum`.
   - This logic seems incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum sum. The maximum sum should be \( n^2 \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \), which is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times.

3. **Calculating Number of Operations:**
   - The program prints the calculated `sum` and the number of operations as `n + r`.
   - It then prints the operations:
     - For the first `n` operations, it performs a Type 1 operation on each row, assigning the permutation from 1 to \( n \).
     - For the next `r` operations, it performs a Type 2 operation on each column, assigning the permutation from 1 to \( n \).

### Correctness Analysis

- **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
  - The program's logic for calculating the maximum sum is incorrect. It does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the matrix, which should be \( n^2 \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \).

- **Number of Operations:**
  - The program claims to use `n + r` operations, but the logic for determining `r` is flawed. The correct approach is to use exactly \( n \) operations of Type 1 and \( n \) operations of Type 2, totaling \( 2n \) operations.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix and does not follow the logic required to achieve the maximum sum with the specified constraints.

**Correctness: False**
