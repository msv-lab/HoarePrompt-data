### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment based on the problem description and function summaries.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using up to \( 2n \) operations. The optimal strategy involves filling each row and column with permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \). The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix can be calculated as \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), because each row and each column will contain the numbers from 1 to \( n \).

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).

2. **Calculating the Sum:**
   - The program initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \( n \). The logic inside the loop is incorrect:
     - The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is not appropriate for calculating the maximum sum.
     - The correct sum should be calculated as `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`.

3. **Printing the Result:**
   - The number of operations `m` is calculated as `n + r`, which is not correct.
   - The operations are printed in a loop, but the logic for the operations is incorrect:
     - It prints a type 1 operation for the first \( n \) rows.
     - It prints a type 2 operation for the remaining operations, but the row/column index and permutation are not correctly managed.

#### Correct Logic:

1. **Calculating the Sum:**
   - The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Printing the Result:**
   - The number of operations should be \( 2n \) because we can fill each row and each column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), print a type 1 operation with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), print a type 2 operation with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

### Correct Implementation:
Based on the above analysis, the correct implementation should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum or the operations needed to achieve it. The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
