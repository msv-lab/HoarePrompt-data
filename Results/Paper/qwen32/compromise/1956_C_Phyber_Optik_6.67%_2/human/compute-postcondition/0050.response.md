Output State: **`sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is greater than 0, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**

Explanation: The value of `sum` is updated to `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The values of `r`, `n`, `t`, and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` remain unchanged.
