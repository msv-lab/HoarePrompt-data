The value of `r` is updated to the value of `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `sum`, and the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `sum` is 0; `r` is `i`; the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)` is true.**
