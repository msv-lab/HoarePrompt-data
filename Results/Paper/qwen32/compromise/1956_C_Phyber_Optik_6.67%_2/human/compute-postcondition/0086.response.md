To determine the final output state after the loop completes all iterations, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the given code and initial conditions.

The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`, where `r` is the floor of `n/2`. During each iteration, the loop prints specific values based on the value of `j` relative to `n`.

- If `j <= n`, the loop prints `1 j` followed by the sequence `1` to `n`.
- If `j > n`, the loop prints `2 (j % n)` followed by the sequence `1` to `n`.

The loop will execute `n + r` times. After all iterations, `j` will have taken on every integer value from `1` to `n + r`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state will be characterized by the following:

- The loop will have completed all `n + r` iterations.
- `j` will be `n + r + 1` after the loop ends, as the loop stops when `j` reaches `n + r`.
- The values of `sum`, `n`, and `r` will remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop.

Here's the final output state:

Output State: **`j` is `n + r + 1` after the loop completes all iterations; `sum`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be one more than the total number of iterations it performed (`n + r + 1`). The variables `sum`, `n`, and `r` will retain their initial values as they were not altered by the loop.
