Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `sum` is the sum of a series (the exact series is not specified, but it's irrelevant for this print statement).
- `n` is at least 2.
- `r` is the floor of `n/2`.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `j` is less than `n + r + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `1`:** The first argument in the `print` statement is the integer `1`.
2. **Value of `j`:** The second argument in the `print` statement is the variable `j`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and is guaranteed to be less than `n + r + 1`, its exact value depends on the specific iteration in which the print statement is executed. However, we don't have the initial value of `j` or the specific iteration, so we can only describe `j` in terms of its properties.
3. **`end=' '`:** This argument specifies that the print statement should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the integer `1`, followed by the current value of `j`, and the output will end with a space.

Since the exact value of `j` is not specified, we can only describe it as `j` (where `j` is an integer that has been incremented by 1 in each iteration and is less than `n + r + 1`).

Output: **1 [j] (where j is the current value of j, incremented by 1 in each iteration and less than n + r + 1)**
