The value of `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 4. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 4; `r` is 4.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 4; `r` is 4.**
