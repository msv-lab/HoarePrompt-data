Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` is either `2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, or `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was less than or equal to `i * n` initially, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

In simpler terms, the value of `r` is now equal to `i + 1`, and the value of `i` has also been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial conditions.
