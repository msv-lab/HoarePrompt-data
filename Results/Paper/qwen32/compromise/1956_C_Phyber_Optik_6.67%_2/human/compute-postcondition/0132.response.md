Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` representing the size of an `n Ã— n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates a sum and a value `r`, then prints the sum and `n + r`. It also prints a sequence of commands that involve printing rows of the matrix. The function does not modify the matrix itself but outputs a series of commands that could be used to fill or manipulate the matrix.**
