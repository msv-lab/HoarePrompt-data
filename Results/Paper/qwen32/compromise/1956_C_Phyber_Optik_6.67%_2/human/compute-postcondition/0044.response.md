The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1 if the loop had executed. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`
- `r = 1`
- `n = n`

Since `t` is the only variable that can be adjusted and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, we adjust `t` accordingly.

State: **`sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r = 1`, `n = n`, `t` must be greater than 0**
