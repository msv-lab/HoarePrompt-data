Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

Initial State:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `r` is 0
- The condition `j > n` is given, but in this case, `j` is equal to `n` (both are 1), so the condition `j > n` is false. However, this condition does not affect the execution of the print statement directly.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Let's break down the values:
- The first value to be printed is the integer `2`.
- The second value to be printed is the result of the expression `j % n`. Here, `j` is 1 and `n` is 1, so `j % n` is `1 % 1`, which equals `0`.
- The `end=' '` argument specifies that the print statement will end with a space instead of the default newline character.

Combining these, the output will be the integer `2` followed by the integer `0`, separated by a space, and ending with a space.

Output: **2 0 **
