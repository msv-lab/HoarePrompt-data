The `print` statement is given as `print(1, j, end=' ')`. According to the initial state, the value of `j` is 1, and `n` is 1, but `n` is not used in this particular print statement. The `end=' '` argument specifies that the output should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

Let's break down the print statement:
- The first argument is the integer `1`.
- The second argument is the variable `j`, which has a value of `1`.
- The `end=' '` argument modifies the end of the print output to a space.

Given these details, the output of the print statement will be the numbers `1` and `1`, separated by a space, with no newline at the end.

Output: **1 1 **
