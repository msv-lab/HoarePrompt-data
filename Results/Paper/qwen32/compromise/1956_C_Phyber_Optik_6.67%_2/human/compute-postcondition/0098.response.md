Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, or `i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `r` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `r` is updated to be equal to `i`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
