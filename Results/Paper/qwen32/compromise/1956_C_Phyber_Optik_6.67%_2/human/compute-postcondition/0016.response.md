The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 5. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted as it is already defined and does not change within the loop head.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 5. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `r` is set to 4 and `sum` is increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is increased by `4 * n`.**
