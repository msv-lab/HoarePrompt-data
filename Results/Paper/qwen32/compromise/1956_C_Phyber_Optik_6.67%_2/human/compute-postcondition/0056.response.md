The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` increments the value of `sum` by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The initial value of `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. After the operation, `sum` will be the initial value of `sum` plus `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

The values of `r` and `i` remain unchanged by this operation, and `n` and `t` are still valid with their respective conditions.

Output State: **`sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` initially, or `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` otherwise; `r` is `i`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, Output State: **`sum` is either `2 * n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` initially, or `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` otherwise; `r` is `i`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**
