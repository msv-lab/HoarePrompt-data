To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `n`:** The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive). If `n` is 0 or negative, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

2. **Variable `i`:** The loop variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is `n + r`
- `sum` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `r` is 0

The only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `n`. It must be at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:
State: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `r` is 0**
