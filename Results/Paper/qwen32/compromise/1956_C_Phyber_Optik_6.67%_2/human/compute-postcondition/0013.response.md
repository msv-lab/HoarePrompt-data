The code snippet provided modifies the value of `sum` by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 4; `r` is 4; `sum` is increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.**
