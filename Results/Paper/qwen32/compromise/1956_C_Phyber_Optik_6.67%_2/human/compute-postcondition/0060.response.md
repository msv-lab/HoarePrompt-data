Output State: **`sum` is either `2 * n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` initially, or `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` otherwise, `r` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is greater than 0, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to `i`, and since `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, `r` becomes `i + 1`. The values of `sum`, `n`, `t`, and `i` remain as specified in the initial state.
