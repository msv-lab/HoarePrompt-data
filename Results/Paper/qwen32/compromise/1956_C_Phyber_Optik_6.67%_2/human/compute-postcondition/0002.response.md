Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer.**

Natural language: The variable `n` is now assigned the value of the next input integer. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it still represents the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
