Let's break down the provided initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`
   - This formula calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. However, the value of `sum` is not used in the print statement, so we don't need to compute it further for this task.
2. `r = 1`
   - The variable `r` is set to 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
3. `n` must be at least 0
   - This is a constraint on the value of `n`, but its specific value is not provided. However, we do not need the exact value of `n` to determine the output because it is not directly used in the print statement.
4. `j = n + 1`
   - The variable `j` is set to `n + 1`. Since `n` is at least 0, `j` will be at least 1.

### Print Statement:
```
print(1, j, end=' ')
```
- The `print` function will output the values `1` and `j`, separated by a space.
- The `end=' '` argument specifies that the output should end with a space instead of a newline.

### Determining the Output:
- The value `1` is explicitly given.
- The value `j` is `n + 1`. Since we don't have the exact value of `n`, we can only express `j` in terms of `n`. However, we know that `j` will be an integer that is at least 1.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be the number `1`, followed by the value of `j` (which is `n + 1`), separated by a space, and ending with a space.

Output: **1, j (where j is n + 1)**
