Output State: **`a` contains `n` elements starting with the last element of the original `a` and each subsequent element is the previous element plus the corresponding element in `T` (in reverse order); `result` is a space-separated string of these elements; `t` is `False`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `True` (which is equivalent to 1 in a numerical context) to `False` (equivalent to 0). The other variables `a` and `result` remain unchanged.
