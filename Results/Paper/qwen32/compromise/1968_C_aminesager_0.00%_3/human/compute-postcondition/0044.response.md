To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the current state:
- `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[i - 1], 1000 - 2 * T[i - 1]]`
- `result` is a space-separated string of these elements
- `t` is `False`
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `line` is the input string
- `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`
- `i` is 4

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since `i` is currently 4, the next value of `i` should be 5 (as `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration). The variable `n` does not need to be changed because it determines the upper limit of the loop, and it is already given that `n` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[i - 1], 1000 - 2 * T[i - 1]]`, `result` is a space-separated string of these elements, `t` is `False`, `n` must be greater than 4, `line` is the input string, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `i` is 5**
