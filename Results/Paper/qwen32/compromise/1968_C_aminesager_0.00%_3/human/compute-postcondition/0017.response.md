To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The loop condition is `while t:` which means the loop will continue as long as `t` is non-zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1;
- `n` must be greater than 0;
- `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500;
- `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `line`;
- `a` is `[1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000]`;
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` joined by spaces.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is adjusted to a value greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `line`; `a` is `[1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000]`; `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` joined by spaces.**
