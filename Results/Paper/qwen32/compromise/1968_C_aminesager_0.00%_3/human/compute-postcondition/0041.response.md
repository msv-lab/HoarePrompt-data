Given the code snippet `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])`, let's determine the new state of the variables.

- `a` initially contains `[1000]`.
- `result` is a space-separated string of these elements, which means `result` is `"1000"`.
- `t` is `False`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `line` is the input string.
- `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`.

The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. 

Since `a` initially has only one element, `a[0]` is `1000`. For the calculation to proceed, `i` must be at least 1 (as `i - 1` needs to be a valid index). Given that `n > 1`, `i` could be any integer from 1 to `n-1`. However, without a specific value for `i`, we can only express the new element in terms of `i`.

The new element appended to `a` will be `1000 - T[i - 1]`.

Thus, the updated list `a` will be `[1000, 1000 - T[i - 1]]`.

Output State: **`a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[i - 1]]`; `result` is a space-separated string of these elements; `t` is `False`; `n` must be greater than 1; `line` is the input string; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`.**
