The code provided reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the integer value provided by user input; `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500; `line` is the string provided by user input.**
