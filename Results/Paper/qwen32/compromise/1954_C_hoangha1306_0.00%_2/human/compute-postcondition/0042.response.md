Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 1. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each increased by the integer value of `a[1]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`; `y` is the maximum of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`; `vt` is set to 1 if it was initially 0, otherwise it remains unchanged; `kq1` is the string representation of `x` if `a[i] <= b[i]` and `vt` was initially 0, otherwise `kq1` is the string representation of `y`; `kq2` is the string representation of `y` concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `vt` was initially 0, otherwise `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
