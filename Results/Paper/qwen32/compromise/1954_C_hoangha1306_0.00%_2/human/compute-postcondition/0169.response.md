The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(x)` appends the string representation of `x` to the variable `kq1`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `vt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is updated to reflect the new value of `kq1`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`; `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is `kq1` + `str(x)`**
