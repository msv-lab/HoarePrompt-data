The code `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq1`. 

Given the initial state, `kq1` is not explicitly defined, so we assume it holds some string value. The value of `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. 

Thus, the new value of `kq1` will be its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `y`.

Output State: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is its previous value concatenated with `str(y)`**.
