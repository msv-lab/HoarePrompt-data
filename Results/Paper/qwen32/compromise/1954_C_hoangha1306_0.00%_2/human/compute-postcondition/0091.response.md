Output State: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `kq1` is `kq1` + `a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2` + `a[i]`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the variables `q` and `i` are incremented by 1, and `kq1` and `kq2` are updated by appending `a[i]` to their current values. The other variables remain unchanged.
