Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `kq1` is ''; `kq2` is ''; `vt` is 0; `x` and `y` are the last compared minimum and maximum values; `t` remains unchanged; `q` is `q + 1`; `a` is the user input; `b` is the user input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with `a[i]`, and `kq2` is `a[i]`. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are set to the string representations of `y` and `x` respectively if `vt` was initially 0 and `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, or `x` and `y` respectively if `vt` was initially 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` and `kq2` are set to the string representations of `y` and `x` respectively. `vt` is 1 if it was initially 0 and `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, and remains unchanged otherwise. `x` and `y` are updated to the minimum and maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` respectively if `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, and remain unchanged otherwise. `t` remains unchanged, `q` is `q + 1`, `a` is a sequence with at least one element, and `b` is the user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with `a[i]`, and `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with `a[i]`. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated as follows: if `vt` was initially 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with `str(x)`, and `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with `str(y)`. If `vt` was initially 0 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `b[i]`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)`, and `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with `str(x)`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)`, and `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with `str(x)`. `vt` is set to 1 if it was initially 0 and `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, and remains unchanged otherwise. `x` and `y` are updated to the minimum and maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` respectively if `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, and remain unchanged otherwise. `t` remains unchanged, `q` is `q + 1`, `a` remains a sequence with at least one element, `b` remains the user input, and `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each increased by `a[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `y` is set to the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `vt` was originally 0, `vt` is set to 1, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(x)` if `a[i] <= b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)`, and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(y)` if `a[i] <= b[i]`, otherwise `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
