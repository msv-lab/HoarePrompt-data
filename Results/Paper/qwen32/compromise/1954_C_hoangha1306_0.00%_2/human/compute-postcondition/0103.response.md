The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the string `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that the other state variables (`a`, `b`, `t`, `q`, `kq1`, `kq2`, `vt`, `x`, `y`) are not part of the loop head, they should remain unchanged.

State: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1**
