Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`; `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`. If `vt` was originally 0, then `vt` is 1, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(x)` if `a[i] <= b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)`, and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(y)` if `a[i] <= b[i]`, otherwise `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`. If `vt` was not 0, then `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`.**
