To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq2)` statement, we need to understand the context in which `kq2` is defined. The problem statement provides some clues, but it does not explicitly define `kq1` or `kq2` or how they are built based on the comparison of `a` and `b`. However, we can infer based on typical string comparison logic.

Given:
- `kq1` and `kq2` are strings built based on the comparison of `a` and `b`.
- `vt` is 1 if there was at least one mismatch during the comparison of `a` and `b`, otherwise 0.
- `x` and `y` are the minimum and maximum of the last compared characters.
- `t` remains unchanged.

Let's assume a common approach to building `kq1` and `kq2` in the context of comparing two strings `a` and `b`:

1. **Initialization**: `kq1` and `kq2` are likely initialized as empty strings.
2. **Comparison Loop**: Loop through each character of `a` and `b` (assuming `a` and `b` are of the same length for simplicity):
   - If the characters match, append the character to both `kq1` and `kq2`.
   - If the characters do not match, append a marker (e.g., `*`) to `kq1` and append the character from `b` to `kq2`.

Given this typical behavior, `kq2` will contain the characters from `b`, but with mismatches marked in `kq1`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't determine the exact content of `kq2`. However, we can describe it in terms of `b` and the comparison process.

**Output Description**:
The `print(kq2)` statement will print the string `kq2`, which is constructed by taking each character from string `b` and marking mismatches in `kq1`. Since the exact content of `b` and the comparison results are not provided, the output will be in terms of `b`.

Output: **kq2 (where kq2 is the string constructed from b with mismatches marked in kq1)**
