Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length; `t` is greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the values of user input and have lengths greater than 0; `i` is 2. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with `a[2]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(x)` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise with `str(y)`, and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise with `str(y)`.**
