The code snippet provided is `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)`. This line appends the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq1`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a string with at least one character.
- `b` is the new input string.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `q` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

The impact of the code is that `kq1` will now include the string representation of `y` appended to its previous value. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`.**
