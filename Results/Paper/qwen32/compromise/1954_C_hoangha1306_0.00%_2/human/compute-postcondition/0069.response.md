The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` concatenates the character `a[i]` to the string `kq1`. 

Given that `kq1` was initially an empty string `''`, after executing this line, `kq1` will hold the character `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is `a[i]`, `kq2` is `''`, `vt` is 0, `x` and `y` are the minimum and maximum of the last compared characters, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`.**
