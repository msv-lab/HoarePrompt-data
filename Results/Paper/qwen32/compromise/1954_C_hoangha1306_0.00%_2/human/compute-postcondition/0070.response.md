Output State: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is `a[i]`, `kq2` is `a[i]`, `vt` is 0, `x` and `y` are the minimum and maximum of the last compared characters, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `kq2` is updated to be the concatenation of its previous value (which is an empty string `''`) and the character `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
