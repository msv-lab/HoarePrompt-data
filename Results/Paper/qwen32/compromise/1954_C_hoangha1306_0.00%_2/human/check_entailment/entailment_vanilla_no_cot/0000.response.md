Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers by performing the allowed operations. The logic in the program is flawed as it only considers the first differing digit pair and then alternates between taking the maximum and minimum of subsequent pairs, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum product.

To maximize the product, a better strategy would be to sort the digits of both numbers and then greedily match the largest remaining digits from one number with the smallest remaining digits from the other number. This ensures that the resulting numbers are as balanced as possible, which tends to maximize their product.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Convert strings to lists of digits and sort them
        a_digits = sorted(list(a))
        b_digits = sorted(list(b))
        
        # Reverse one of the lists to maximize the product
        b_digits.reverse()
        
        # Form the new numbers
        kq1 = ''.join(a_digits)
        kq2 = ''.join(b_digits)
        
        print(kq1)
        print(kq2)

func()
```

This version sorts the digits of both numbers and then reverses one of the lists to maximize the product of the two resulting numbers.
