`small_element` is assigned the value `left + 1`. The values of `left`, `right`, and `clique` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices in the range [left, right] will be assigned, and `small_element` is equal to `left + 1`.
