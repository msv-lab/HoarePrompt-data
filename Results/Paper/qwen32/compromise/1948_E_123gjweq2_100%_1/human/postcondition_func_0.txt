The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and 2n inclusive. It constructs a list `arr` of length `n` where each segment of length `k` or less is filled with consecutive integers starting from 1 up to the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`. Another list `cliquess` of length `n` with all elements set to 0 is also created. The function prints the list `arr`, the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`, and the list `cliquess`. The function does not return any value explicitly.
