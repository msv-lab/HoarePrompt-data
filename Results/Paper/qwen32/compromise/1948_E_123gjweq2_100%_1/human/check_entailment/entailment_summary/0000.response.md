Let's analyze the provided code and its behavior to determine if it meets the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to assign distinct integers to vertices from 1 to n such that for every pair of vertices (i, j), an edge is added if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k. The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the assignment, the number of cliques, and the partition itself.

### Code Analysis:

#### Function `func_1(n, k)`:
- **Purpose**: To initialize the assignment of integers to vertices and determine the number of cliques.
- **Steps**:
  - Calculate the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`. This is intended to minimize the number of cliques.
  - Initialize two lists: `arr` (to store the integer assignment to vertices) and `cliquess` (to store the clique assignment for each vertex).
  - Call `make_array` for each clique segment to populate `arr` and `cliquess`.
  - Print the integer assignment, the number of cliques, and the clique assignment.

#### Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`:
- **Purpose**: To populate the `arr` and `cliquess` lists for a given segment.
- **Steps**:
  - Calculate the middle point of the segment.
  - Assign increasing values to the first half of the segment and decreasing values to the second half.
  - Assign the same clique number to all vertices in the segment.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `arr` and `cliquess`**:
   - `arr` and `cliquess` are declared as global variables within `func_1` but are not explicitly declared as global in `make_array`. This means they are treated as local variables in `make_array`, leading to errors or unintended behavior.
   
2. **Assignment of Values**:
   - The code assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` based on the segment length, but it does not ensure that all values in `arr` are distinct integers from 1 to n.
   - The logic for populating `arr` with distinct values is flawed. The current implementation does not guarantee that the values will be in the range [1, n] and will be distinct.

3. **Edge Condition**:
   - The code does not ensure that the edges are added according to the condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k. The assignment of values does not consider this condition.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The values in `arr` are not guaranteed to be distinct integers from 1 to n, and the clique assignment does not necessarily create a valid partition based on the edge condition.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
