It appears there is a slight discrepancy in the provided example. The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but the parameter constraints specify `start` and `end` as integers. To align with the provided constraints, I will assume the function should accept `start` and `end` as parameters. Here is the correct description:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are integers such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The function returns a list of integers from `start` to `end` inclusive.**
