Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct an array such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences.
- The array can have a length of at most 200.
- If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should output -1.
- If there are multiple solutions, any valid array is acceptable.
- Increasing subsequences are defined as subsequences where the elements are strictly increasing and can be obtained by removing some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program constructs an array based on the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer X.
3. It initializes `max` and `min` to large positive and negative values, respectively.
4. It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the array elements.
5. It enters a loop that continues until X becomes 1.
6. Inside the loop:
   - If X is even, it appends the current `max` value to the array, decrements `max`, and divides X by 2.
   - If X is odd, it appends the current `min` value to the array, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from X.
7. It reverses the `ans` array and prints its length followed by the elements of the array.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Construction of Increasing Subsequences**:
   - The program attempts to construct the array based on the binary representation of X, but this does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - The logic of appending `max` and `min` values does not ensure that the subsequences are strictly increasing.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where it is impossible to construct an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. For example, for X = 1, the only possible array is an empty array, but the program does not handle this case explicitly.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs -1 only if no valid array can be constructed, but the logic for constructing the array is flawed, and it does not correctly handle the construction for all values of X.

### Conclusion:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not ensure that the constructed array has exactly X increasing subsequences, and it does not handle all edge cases appropriately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
