Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The approach used in the program does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly X. Instead, it seems to be attempting a binary representation of X, which is not a valid strategy for constructing the required array.

To solve the problem, one needs to understand that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be controlled by the placement of elements. For example, an array of all distinct elements will have \(2^n\) increasing subsequences (including the empty subsequence), and an array with repeated elements can be crafted to achieve a specific number of increasing subsequences.

A correct approach would involve constructing an array that achieves the exact number of increasing subsequences X, which is a non-trivial task and often requires careful placement of elements. The provided program does not follow such a strategy and thus is incorrect.
