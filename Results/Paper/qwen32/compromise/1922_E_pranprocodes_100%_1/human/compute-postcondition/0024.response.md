Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `x` is an input integer that has been either divided by 2 (if the original `x` is even) or decremented by 1 (if the original `x` is odd) and is not equal to 1. If the original `x` is even, `max` is set to 99999998 and `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999]`. If the original `x` is odd, `min` is set to -99999998 and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999]`. If the original `x` is even, `min` is set to 99999999. If the original `x` is odd, `max` is set to -100000000`.**
