The code snippet `ans.append(max)` appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `max` is either 99999998 (if the original `x` is even) or -100000000 (if the original `x` is odd). The list `ans` initially contains either `[100000000, 99999999]` (if `x` is even) or `[-100000000, -99999999]` (if `x` is odd). After appending `max`, the list `ans` will contain three elements.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is an input integer that has been either divided by 2 (if the original `x` is even) or decremented by 1 (if the original `x` is odd) and is not equal to 1. If the original `x` is even, `max` is 99999998 and `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999, 99999998]`. If the original `x` is odd, `min` is -99999998 and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, -100000000]`. If the original `x` is even, `min` is 99999999. If the original `x` is odd, `max` is -100000000.**
