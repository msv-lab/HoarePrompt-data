The value of `min` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `min` is -99999999 if `x` was odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000. Therefore, after the increment, `min` becomes -99999998 if `x` was odd, or -99999999 if `x` was even.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is the input integer divided by 2 if it is even, otherwise `x` is the input integer minus 1 and `x` is not equal to 1 or 0. `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even, otherwise `max` is 100000000. `min` is -99999998 if `x` was odd, otherwise `min` is -99999999. `ans` is [100000000, -100000000] if `x` was even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999]. `i` is incremented by 1.**
