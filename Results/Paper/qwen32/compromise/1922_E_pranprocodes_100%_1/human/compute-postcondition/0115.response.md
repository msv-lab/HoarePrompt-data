Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is the number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1.
- `x` is 1.
- `max` is 100000000 minus the number of times `x` was even.
- `min` is -100000000 plus the number of times `x` was odd.
- `ans` is a reversed list of `max` and `min` values based on the parity of `x` in each iteration.
- `i` is 1.

### Observations:
- Since `x` is already 1, no iterations are needed to reduce `x` to 1. Therefore, `t` should be 0.
- The values of `max` and `min` depend on the number of times `x` was even or odd during the iterations. Since there are no iterations, these values are not updated from their initial definitions.
- The variable `ans` is a reversed list of `max` and `min` values, but since there are no iterations, `ans` remains an empty list or not relevant for the `print(t)` statement.

### Conclusion:
- The variable `t` is 0 because `x` is already 1 and no iterations are needed.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
