The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Given that `x` is initially an odd integer and not equal to 1, after decrementing, `x` will be an even integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `x` is an even integer (initial odd integer - 1), `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is [-100000000].

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an even integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [-100000000]**
