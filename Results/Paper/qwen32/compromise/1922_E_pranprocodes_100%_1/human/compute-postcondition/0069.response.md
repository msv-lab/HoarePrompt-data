Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` must not be 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 99999999 or 100000000 based on the input integer's parity. `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000 or -99999998 based on the input integer's parity. `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, `min`] if `x` is even, [100000000, -100000000, `min`] if the input integer was even and `x` is odd, [-100000000, 100000000, `min`] if the input integer was odd and `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999, `min`]. `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The variable `ans` now includes the value of `min` appended to it. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
