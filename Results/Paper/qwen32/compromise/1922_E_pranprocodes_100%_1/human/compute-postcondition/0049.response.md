The value of `x` is updated to be `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 using integer division. The other variables (`t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is the input integer divided by 2, `x` must not be equal to 1, `x` is even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000], `i` is incremented by 1**.
