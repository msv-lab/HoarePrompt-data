The code snippet `ans.append(max)` appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. The value of `max` is determined by the parity of `x`. Since `x` must not be 1, the specific value of `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999 or 100000000 based on the input integer's parity. The value of `ans` will change to include this new value.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` must not be 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 99999999 or 100000000 based on the input integer's parity, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000 or -99999998 based on the input integer's parity, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, `max`] if `x` is even, [100000000, -100000000, `max`] if the input integer was even and `x` is odd, [-100000000, 100000000, `max`] if the input integer was odd and `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999, `max`], `i` is incremented by 1.**
