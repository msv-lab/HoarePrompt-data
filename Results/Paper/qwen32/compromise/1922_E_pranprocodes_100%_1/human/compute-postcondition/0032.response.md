Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is an input integer that has been either divided by 2 (if the original `x` is even) or decremented by 1 (if the original `x` is odd) and then decremented by 1 again, and is not equal to 1. If the original `x` is even, `max` is 99999998 and `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999, 99999999]`. If the original `x` is odd, `min` is -99999999 and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, -100000000]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `x` has been decremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. The condition that `x` is not equal to 1 still holds.
