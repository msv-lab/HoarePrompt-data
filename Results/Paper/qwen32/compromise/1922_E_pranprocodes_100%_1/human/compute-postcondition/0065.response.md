The only variable in the loop head is `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is updated based on the input integer's parity, but the specific value of `x` is not provided. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `x` must be any value other than 1.

State: **`t` is 2, `x` must not be 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 99999999 or 100000000 based on the input integer's parity. `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000 or -99999998 based on the input integer's parity. `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` is even, [100000000, -100000000] if the input integer was even and `x` is odd, [-100000000, 100000000] if the input integer was odd and `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999]. `i` is incremented by 1.**
