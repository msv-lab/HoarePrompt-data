The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. The value of `max` depends on whether `x` is even or odd. Since the initial state specifies that `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even and 100000000 if `x` was odd, and `ans` is initialized as `[100000000]` if `x` was even and `[-100000000]` if `x` was odd, the new value of `ans` will be `[100000000, 100000000]` if `x` was even and `[-100000000, 100000000]` if `x` was odd. The values of `t`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` must not be 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even and 100000000 if `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and -99999999 if `x` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 100000000] if `x` was even and [-100000000, 100000000] if `x` was odd, `i` is 1**
