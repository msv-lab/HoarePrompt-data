Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: The number of iterations.
2. **`x`**: Initialized to 1.
3. **`max` and `min`**: Adjusted based on the sequence of even and odd values of `x`.
4. **`ans`**: Contains the accumulated `max` and `min` values in reversed order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(*ans)` statement will unpack and print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces. To determine what gets printed, we need to understand how `max`, `min`, and `ans` are adjusted during the iterations.

### Iteration Logic:
- **Initialization**: `x = 1`, `max` and `min` are likely initialized based on the first value of `x`.
- **Iterations**: For each iteration, `x` is adjusted (possibly incremented or modified in some way), and `max` and `min` are updated based on whether `x` is even or odd.
- **Accumulation**: After each iteration, the current `max` and `min` values are added to `ans`.
- **Reversal**: Finally, `ans` contains the accumulated `max` and `min` values in reversed order.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's assume `t = 5` for simplicity and walk through the iterations:

1. **Iteration 1**:
   - `x = 1` (odd)
   - `max = 1`, `min = 1`
   - `ans = [1, 1]`

2. **Iteration 2**:
   - `x = 2` (even)
   - `max = 2`, `min = 1`
   - `ans = [1, 1, 2, 1]`

3. **Iteration 3**:
   - `x = 3` (odd)
   - `max = 3`, `min = 1`
   - `ans = [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1]`

4. **Iteration 4**:
   - `x = 4` (even)
   - `max = 4`, `min = 1`
   - `ans = [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1]`

5. **Iteration 5**:
   - `x = 5` (odd)
   - `max = 5`, `min = 1`
   - `ans = [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1]`

### Reversal:
After 5 iterations, `ans` is reversed, so the final `ans` would be:
- `ans = [1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1]`

### Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 5 1 4 1 3 1 2 1 1** (where `ans` is the list of accumulated `max` and `min` values in reversed order based on the iterations)

Since the exact value of `t` and the specific adjustments to `x`, `max`, and `min` are not provided, the above example assumes a specific pattern. However, the format of the output will be the reversed list of accumulated `max` and `min` values based on the given logic.

If the exact values of `t`, `x`, `max`, and `min` were provided, the output could be more precisely determined. But based on the given information, the output format is as described.

Output: **1 5 1 4 1 3 1 2 1 1 (where ans is the list of accumulated max and min values in reversed order based on the iterations)**
