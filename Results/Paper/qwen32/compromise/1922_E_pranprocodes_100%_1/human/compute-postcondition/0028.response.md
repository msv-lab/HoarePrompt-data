The code snippet `max -= 1` decrements the value of `max` by 1. Given the initial state, we need to consider two cases based on whether the original `x` was even or odd.

1. If the original `x` was even:
   - `max` was initially 99999998.
   - After executing `max -= 1`, `max` becomes 99999997.
   - The values of `t`, `x`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

2. If the original `x` was odd:
   - `max` was initially -100000000.
   - After executing `max -= 1`, `max` becomes -100000001.
   - The values of `t`, `x`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is an input integer that has been either divided by 2 (if the original `x` is even) or decremented by 1 (if the original `x` is odd) and is not equal to 1; if the original `x` is even, `max` is 99999997 and `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999, 99999998]`, `min` is 99999999; if the original `x` is odd, `max` is -100000001 and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, -100000000]`, `min` is -99999998.**
