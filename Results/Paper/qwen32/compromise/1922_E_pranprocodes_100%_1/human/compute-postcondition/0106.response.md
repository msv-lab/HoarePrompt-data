The value of `max` is decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `x`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is any value other than 1, `max` is 99999997 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, 99999998 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, 99999999 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or 99999999 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, -99999999 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, -99999999 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or -99999998 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 100000000, `max`] if `x` was even, [100000000, -100000000, `max`] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or [-100000000, -99999999, `max`] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, and `i` is 1.**
