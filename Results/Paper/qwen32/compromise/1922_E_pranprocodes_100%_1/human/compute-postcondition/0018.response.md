Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is an input integer and must not be equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` is even or [-100000000, -99999999] if `x` is odd.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` is updated to include `max` at the end of the list. The values of `t`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain as per the initial state, with the specific conditions applied based on whether `x` is even or odd.
