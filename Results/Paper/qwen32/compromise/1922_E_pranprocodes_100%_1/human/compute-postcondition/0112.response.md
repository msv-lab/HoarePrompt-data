Output State: **`t` is 3, `x` is `x // 2` if `x` was even, otherwise `x` remains the same and is any value other than 2, `max` is updated based on the evenness of `x` and `x - 1` as follows: 99999997 if both `x // 2` and `x // 2 - 1` are even, 99999998 if `x // 2` is even and `x // 2 - 1` is odd, 99999999 if `x // 2` is odd and `x // 2 - 1` is even, or 99999999 if `x // 2` is odd and `x // 2 - 1` is odd, and for the else case, `max` is 99999999 if both `x` and `x - 1` are even, 99999998 if `x` is even and `x - 1` is odd, 100000000 if `x` is odd and `x - 1` is even, or 100000000 if `x` is odd and `x - 1` is odd, `min` is updated similarly based on the evenness of `x` and `x - 1` as follows: -100000000 if both `x // 2` and `x // 2 - 1` are even, -99999999 if `x // 2` is even and `x // 2 - 1` is odd, -99999999 if `x // 2` is odd and `x // 2 - 1` is even, or -99999998 if `x // 2` is odd and `x // 2 - 1` is odd, and for the else case, `min` is -99999998 if both `x` and `x - 1` are even, -99999997 if `x` is even and `x - 1` is odd, -99999998 if `x` is odd and `x - 1` is even, or -99999997 if `x` is odd and `x - 1` is odd, `ans` is updated based on the evenness of `x` and `x - 1` as follows: [100000000, 100000000, `max`] if `x` was even, [100000000, -100000000, `max`] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or [-100000000, -99999999, `max`] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, and for the else case, `ans` is [100000000, 100000000, -99999999] if both `x` and `x - 1` are even, [100000000, 100000000, -99999998] if `x` is even and `x - 1` is odd, [100000000, -100000000, -99999999] if `x` is odd and `x - 1` is even, or [-100000000, -99999999, -99999998] if `x` is odd and `x - 1` is odd, `i` is 1.**

The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables (`x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
