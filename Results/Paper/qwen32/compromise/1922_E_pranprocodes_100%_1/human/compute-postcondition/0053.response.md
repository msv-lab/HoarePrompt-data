Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is the input integer minus 1 and `x` must not be equal to 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [-100000000], `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` is not divisible by 2.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `x` (not equal to 1 and not divisible by 2) are updated accordingly.
