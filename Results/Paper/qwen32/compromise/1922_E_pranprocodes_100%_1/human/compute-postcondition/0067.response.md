Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` must not be 1, `max` is 99999997 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 99999998 or 99999999 based on the input integer's parity, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000 or -99999998 based on the input integer's parity, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, `max`] if `x` is even, [100000000, -100000000, `max`] if the input integer was even and `x` is odd, [-100000000, 100000000, `max`] if the input integer was odd and `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999, `max`], `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains 2.
- The condition that `x` must not be 1 is still valid.
- The value of `max` is decremented by 1. If `x` is even, `max` is now 99999997. If `x` is odd, `max` is now 99999998 or 99999999 based on the input integer's parity.
- The value of `min` remains unchanged.
- The list `ans` is updated to reflect the new value of `max`. If `x` is even, `ans` is now [100000000, 99999999, 99999997]. If the input integer was even and `x` is odd, `ans` is now [100000000, -100000000, 99999998 or 99999999]. If the input integer was odd and `x` is even, `ans` is now [-100000000, 100000000, 99999998 or 99999999]. Otherwise, `ans` is now [-100000000, -99999999, 99999998 or 99999999].
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but since the exact value of `i` before the increment is not specified, we note that it has been incremented by 1.
