Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is an input integer that has been either divided by 2 (if the original `x` is even) or decremented by 1 (if the original `x` is odd) and is not equal to 1. If the original `x` is even, `max` is 99999998 and `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999, 99999999]`. If the original `x` is odd, `min` is -99999999 and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, -100000000]`.**

In natural language, the value of `min` has been incremented by 1. If `x` was originally odd, `min` was -100000000 and is now -99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
