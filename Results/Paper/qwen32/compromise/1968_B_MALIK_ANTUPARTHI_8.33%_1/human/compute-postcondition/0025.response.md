The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `b`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` and `a` are integers obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are strings obtained from the input; `j` is 2**
