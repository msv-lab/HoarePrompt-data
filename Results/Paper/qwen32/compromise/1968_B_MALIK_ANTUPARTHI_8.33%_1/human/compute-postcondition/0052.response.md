The code snippet `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` assigns to `k` the position (1-based index) of the character `d[j]` in the string `e`. Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `j` remain unchanged except for the new variable `k` being introduced.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `i + 2`; `i` is `i + 1`; `k` is the 1-based index of `d[j]` in the string `e`.**
