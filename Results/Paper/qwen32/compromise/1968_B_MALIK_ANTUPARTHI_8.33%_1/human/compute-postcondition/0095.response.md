The code snippet `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. The initial state indicates that `j` is `j + 1` (which is a bit confusing and seems like a typo or misinterpretation, as `j` cannot be `j + 1` in a meaningful way without a previous assignment or context), and `k` is initially `e.index(d[j]) + 1`. After the execution of the code snippet, the value of `k` changes to `j + 1`.

Given the initial state and the execution of the code, the output state will be:
Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`; `k` is `j + 1`**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` is now equal to the value of `j + 1`, and the value of `j` remains as `j + 1`.
