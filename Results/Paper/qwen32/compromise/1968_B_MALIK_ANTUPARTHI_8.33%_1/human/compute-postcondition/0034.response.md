To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to understand the state of the variable `k` based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `m`: Integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `b`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `c` and `a`: Integers obtained from the input with \(a \geq 1\).
   - `d` and `e`: Strings obtained from the input.
   - `j`: Set to `b - 1` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise the value of `j` where the loop breaks.
   - `k`: The value that caused the loop to break, which could be `j + 1`, `c`, or the index of the character in `e` plus 1.

### Determining the Value of `k`:
The value of `k` is described as the value that caused the loop to break. This could be one of several values:
- `j + 1`: This value is set if the loop breaks at a specific iteration `j`.
- `c`: This value is set if the loop breaks because of a condition involving `c`.
- The index of the character in `e` plus 1: This value is set if the loop breaks because of a condition involving the string `e`.

Since the exact loop and the conditions under which it breaks are not provided, we can only describe `k` based on the possible values it can take.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the description of `k`, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **k (where k is the value that caused the loop to break, which could be j + 1, c, or the index of the character in e plus 1)**
