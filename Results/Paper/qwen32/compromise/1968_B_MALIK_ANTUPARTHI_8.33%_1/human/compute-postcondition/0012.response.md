Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` and `a` are integers obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are strings obtained from the input; `k` is `j + 1`; `j` is 0; either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
