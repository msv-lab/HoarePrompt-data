Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the new input string, `j` is `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `e` is the value of the input, `k` is `i + 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
