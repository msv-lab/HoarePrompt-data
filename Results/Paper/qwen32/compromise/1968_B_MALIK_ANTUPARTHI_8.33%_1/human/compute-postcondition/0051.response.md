The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, provided that `j` is still less than `b`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `j` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
- For the next iteration, `j` should be `i + 2` (incremented by 1).
- The condition `j < b` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `i + 2`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
