The code snippet `b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `b` and `c`. This means the original `b` (which was a binary string) and `a` are no longer relevant to the current state of the program after this line is executed. The variables `n`, `m`, `t`, and the conditions on their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` and `c` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.**
