The value of `k` is updated to `j + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is 0; `k` is `j + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; the character at position `j` in string `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from position `k`. Additionally, either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.**
