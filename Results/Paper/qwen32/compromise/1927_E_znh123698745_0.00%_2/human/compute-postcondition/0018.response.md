Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `i` is `n-1`. If `i` is odd, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive followed by `n-1`, and `answer` contains the integer `n`. If `i` is even, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` list has an additional element which is `array[a[0]]`, and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**
