The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element from `array` at the index specified by the last element of `a` to the `answer` list. Given the initial state, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, so `a[-1]` is -1. However, since `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, using an index of -1 will actually refer to the last element of `array`.

Thus, `answer` will have the integer 1 (its initial value) and the last element of `array` appended to it. Since `array` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, the last element of `array` is `n`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `n`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1**.
