The code appends the element of `array` at the index specified by the last element of `a` to the `answer` list. Initially, `a[-1]` is `-1`, but since Python uses 0-based indexing, `array[-1]` refers to the last element of `array`. Given that `array` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `array[-1]` is `n`. Therefore, `answer` will be updated to `[1, n]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `array`, and `a` remain unchanged except for `answer`, which is now `[1, n]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is [1, n], `a` is [1, -1]**
