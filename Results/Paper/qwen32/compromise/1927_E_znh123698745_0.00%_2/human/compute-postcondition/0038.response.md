The code snippet `a[0] += 1` increments the first element of the list `a` by 1. Initially, `a` is `[1, -1]`, so after the operation, `a[0]` changes from 1 to 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `array`, and `answer`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is [1, 2], `a` is [2, -1]**.
