The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Given the initial state, the list `a` contains the integers 1 and -1. Therefore, `a[-1]` refers to the last element, which is -1. Decrementing -1 by 1 results in -2.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `array`, and `answer`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `n`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2.**
