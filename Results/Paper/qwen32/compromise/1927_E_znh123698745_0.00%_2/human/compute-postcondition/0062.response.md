The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the array `a` by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is an odd integer. The variable `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[-1]]`. After the decrement, the value of the last element of `a` changes, and consequently, the element of `answer` that depends on this value will reflect this change.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is an odd integer, `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[-1] - 1]`**, indicating that the last element of `a` has been decremented by 1.
