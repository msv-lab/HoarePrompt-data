The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element at the index `a[-1]` of `array` to the `answer` list. Given the initial state, we need to determine the effect of this operation on the variables. 

Here, `a[-1]` is the last element of the list `a`. However, `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we can infer that there might be a mistake in the code snippet as `a` is not mentioned in the given initial conditions. Assuming `a` is a list and `a[-1]` is a valid index within the bounds of `array`, the code will append the element at that index to `answer`.

Since `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `n` is greater than 4, the element at `a[-1]` will be an integer between 1 and `n`. 

The output state will include the updated `answer` list, and all other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 4, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 4, `answer` contains the element at index `a[-1]` of `array`.**
