The code creates a list named `array` that contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**
