The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 4, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 4**
