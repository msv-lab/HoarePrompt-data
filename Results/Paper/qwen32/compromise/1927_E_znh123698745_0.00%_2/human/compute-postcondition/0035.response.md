The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` modifies the last element of the list `a`. Initially, `a` is `[1, -1]`. Subtracting 1 from the last element (`-1`) results in `-2`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is [1, n], `a` is [1, -2]**.
