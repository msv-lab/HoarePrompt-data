The code snippet `a[0] += 1` increments the value of the first element of the list `a` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `answer`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is an even integer; `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[0] - 1]`; `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**
