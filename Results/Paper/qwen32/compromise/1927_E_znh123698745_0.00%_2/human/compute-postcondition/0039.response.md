Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, then `answer` is [1, n] and `a` is [1, -2]. Otherwise, `answer` is [1, 2] and `a` is [2, -1].**
