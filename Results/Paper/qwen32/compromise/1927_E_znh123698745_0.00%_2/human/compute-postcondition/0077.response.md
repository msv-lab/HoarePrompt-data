The value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `answer` remain unchanged except that `answer` already had an additional element which is `array[a[0]]` before this operation, and now `a[0]` has a new value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[0] - 1]`, `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**
