The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop will execute based on the range determined by `int(input())`, which is `t` in this context. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Given that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and it represents the number of iterations left, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers in the order [1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., m], where m is the middle element if `n` is odd, and `a` is a list containing the integers [n, -n]**
