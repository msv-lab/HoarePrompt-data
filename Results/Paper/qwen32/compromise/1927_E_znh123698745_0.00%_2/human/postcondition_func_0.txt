The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. For each test case, it constructs and prints a sequence starting with 1, then alternates between the largest and smallest remaining integers up to `n`, ensuring all integers from 1 to `n` are included in the sequence.
