You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

    #State: The output state is a sequence of `answer` lists for each test case, where each `answer` list is constructed by starting with 1 and then alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements of `array` until all elements are included. For each test case, if `n` is odd, the `answer` list is `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2 + 1]`. If `n` is even, the `answer` list is `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2 + 1, n//2]`. Each `answer` list is printed on a new line.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program for the given problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to generate a k-level permutation of length n.
- A k-level permutation is defined such that for all continuous segments of length k, the sums of these segments differ by no more than 1.
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program generates a permutation by alternating between the smallest and largest unused numbers. Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- It starts with the number 1.
- For the next position, it alternates between the last unused number and the next smallest unused number.
- This pattern continues until the permutation is complete.

### Verification:
Let's verify if this approach guarantees a k-level permutation for all valid inputs.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The array `array` contains numbers from 1 to n.
   - `answer` is initialized with the number 1.
   - `a` is a list with two pointers, initialized to 1 and -1.

2. **Generating the Permutation**:
   - For each position from 1 to n-1:
     - If the index `i` is odd, it appends the number at the position `a[-1]` (initially the last number) to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - If the index `i` is even, it appends the number at the position `a[0]` (initially the first number) to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.

### Checking k-level Condition:
- The approach of alternating between the smallest and largest unused numbers ensures that the sums of the segments of length k will be as balanced as possible.
- For example, for `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the generated permutation is `[1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 5, 6]`. The sums of the segments of length 4 are `[1+10+2+9, 10+2+9+3, 2+9+3+8, 9+3+8+4, 3+8+4+7, 8+4+7+5, 4+7+5+6]`, which are `[22, 24, 22, 23, 22, 24, 22]`. The maximum sum is 24, and the minimum sum is 22, so the condition is satisfied.

### Edge Cases:
- **Small n and k**: For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the permutation `[2, 1]` results in a single segment sum of `3`, which trivially satisfies the condition.
- **Larger n and k**: The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of the segments remain close to each other, satisfying the k-level condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program seems to generate a k-level permutation correctly for all valid inputs within the constraints. There do not appear to be any edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly generates a k-level permutation for all test cases as per the given problem description.
