The code snippet assigns the value of `arr[median_index]` to `current_median`. Given that `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` will now hold the value of the middle element of the sorted array `arr`.

Output State: **`heap` contains elements all greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of increments performed to achieve this state, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`.**
