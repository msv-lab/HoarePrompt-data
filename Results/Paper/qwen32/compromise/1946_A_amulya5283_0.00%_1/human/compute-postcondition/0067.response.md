Output State: **results contains the total number of operations for each test case.**

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, the `results` list will contain the total number of operations performed for each test case. Each element in `results` corresponds to the number of increments needed to make all elements in the heap greater than the current median for each respective test case. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, and the individual `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `operations` will reflect the state of the last iteration, but the primary output is the `results` list, which accumulates the operations for all test cases.
