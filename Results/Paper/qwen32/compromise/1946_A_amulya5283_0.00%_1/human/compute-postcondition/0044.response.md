Output State: **heap contains elements all greater than current_median, operations is the total number of increments performed to achieve this state, results contains the value of operations.**

Natural language: The `results` list now includes the `operations` value, which is the total number of increments performed to reach the current state where all elements in `heap` are greater than `current_median`. The values of `heap` and `operations` remain unchanged.
