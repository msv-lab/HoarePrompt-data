The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` adds the value `smallest + 1` to the heap while maintaining the heap property. Since `heap` already contains the value `smallest + 1` as per the initial state, adding it again will simply maintain the heap property, and `heap` will have one more occurrence of `smallest + 1`.

The value of `smallest` remains unchanged, as it is the new smallest element from the heap before the push operation. The value of `current_median` must still be at least `smallest + 1` as per the precondition. The variable `operations` is incremented by 1, as stated in the initial state.

Output State: **`smallest` is the new smallest element from `heap`; `heap` has one more element, `smallest + 1`, and the heap property is restored; `current_median` must be at least `smallest + 1`; `operations` is incremented by 1.**
