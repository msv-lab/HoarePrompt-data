The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` back into the heap, restoring the heap property. The value of `smallest` remains unchanged as it was just the smallest element removed from the heap, but now it is incremented by 1 and added back.

Output State: **`smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`; `heap` has the same number of elements as before, with the heap property restored, and includes the value `smallest + 1`.**
