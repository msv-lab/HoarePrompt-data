Output State: **`smallest` is the new smallest element from `heap`; `heap` has one more element, `smallest + 1`, and the heap property is restored; `current_median` must be at least `smallest + 1`; `operations` is incremented by 2.**

The value of `operations` is incremented by 1 due to the line `operations += 1`, making it `operations` incremented by 2 from its initial state. All other variables remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet.
