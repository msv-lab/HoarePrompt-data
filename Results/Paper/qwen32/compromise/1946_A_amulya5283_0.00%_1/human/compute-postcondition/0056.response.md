The code snippet increments the value of `operations` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added, `operations` is 1, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`.**
