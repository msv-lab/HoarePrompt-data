The code snippet assigns the `heap` variable the value of a slice of the `arr` list starting from the `median_index` to the end of the list. This means `heap` will contain the second half of the sorted list `arr`, including the median if `n` is odd.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`.**
