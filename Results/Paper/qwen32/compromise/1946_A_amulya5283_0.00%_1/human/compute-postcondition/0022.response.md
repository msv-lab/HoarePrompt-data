The code snippet provided simply appends the value of `operations` to the `results` list. This means the `results` list will now contain the value of `operations` as its first element (or the next element if there were already elements in the list).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`; `operations` is the total number of operations performed until the heap's root element is greater than `current_median`.**
