The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the last executed test case. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`; `operations` is the total number of operations performed until the heap's root element is greater than `current_median`; `i` is the index of the next test case to be processed.**

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is 4 (assuming the previous iteration had i=3)**

Given the previous iteration's state where `i` was 3, for the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is 4**
