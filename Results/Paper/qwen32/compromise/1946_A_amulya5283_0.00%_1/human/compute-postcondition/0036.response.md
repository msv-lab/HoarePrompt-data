The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the `heap` and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. Given the initial state, `smallest` was already the smallest element that was removed previously, and `heap` has the same number of elements as before, including `smallest + 1`, with the heap property restored.

After executing the code, `smallest` will now hold the new smallest element from the `heap`. Since `heap` includes `smallest + 1` and the heap property is restored, the new `smallest` will be less than or equal to `smallest + 1`.

The `current_median` must still be at least `smallest + 1` as per the precondition, and `operations` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`smallest` is the new smallest element from `heap`; `heap` has the same number of elements as before, with the heap property restored, and includes the value `smallest + 1`; `current_median` must be at least `smallest + 1`; `operations` is incremented by 1**.
