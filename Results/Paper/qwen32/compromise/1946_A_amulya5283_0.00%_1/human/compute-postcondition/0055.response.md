The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` back into the heap. This means the heap will now contain the elements it had before, plus the new value `smallest + 1`, and it will still be a valid heap.

The values of `heap`, `operations`, `results`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median` remain unchanged by this operation. Only the `heap` is modified by adding the new value.

Output State: **`heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added, `operations` is 0, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`.**
