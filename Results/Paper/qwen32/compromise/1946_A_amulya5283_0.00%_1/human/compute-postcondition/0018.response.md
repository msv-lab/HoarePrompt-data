The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. This operation modifies the heap by removing its smallest element. The other variables remain unchanged unless directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with one less element and includes the next smallest element after the popped one plus one. After executing `heapq.heappop(heap)`, the smallest element of the heap is removed and assigned to `smallest`. Therefore, `heap` will no longer contain this smallest element.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with one less element and now includes the next smallest element after the popped one plus one, excluding the smallest element that was just removed; `operations` is 2; `smallest` is the smallest element that was at the root of the heap; `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median` (assuming the heap property is maintained after the pop operation)**

In simpler terms, the smallest element from the heap is now stored in `smallest`, and the heap no longer contains this element. All other variables remain the same.
