Postcondition: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary where `current_pair` is either incremented by 1 if it already exists or mapped to 1 if it does not; `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.**
