The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The other variables (`test_cases`, `input`, `data`, and `idx`) do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` is an empty list; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is 1**
