Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results` contains the final value of `count`, `freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `count` is 0
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary that includes the key `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, the value associated with `current_pair` in `freq` is incremented by 1 and `count` is updated to this new value. Otherwise, `freq` includes the key `current_pair` with the value `1` and `count` remains 0. `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `arr[0] % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, the value associated with `current_pair` in `freq` is incremented by 1, and `count` is incremented by the value associated with `current_pair` in `freq`. Otherwise, `freq` includes the key `current_pair` with the value `1`, and `count` remains unchanged. `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `a` is the next element in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary where `current_pair` is either incremented by 1 if it already exists or mapped to 1 if it does not; `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
