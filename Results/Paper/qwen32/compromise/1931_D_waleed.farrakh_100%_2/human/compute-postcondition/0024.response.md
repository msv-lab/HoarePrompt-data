The only variable in the loop head is `result`, which is iterating over the `results` list. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still have at least one element left to iterate over. The `result` variable will take the next value from the `results` list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples `((n, x, y, arr), ...)`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` must contain at least one element**
