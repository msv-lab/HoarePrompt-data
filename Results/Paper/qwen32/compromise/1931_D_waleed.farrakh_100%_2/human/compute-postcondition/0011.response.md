The code snippet `n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())` will split the string at `data[idx]` into parts, convert each part to an integer, and then assign these integers to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. Given that `idx` is 3, `data[idx]` refers to `data[3]`, which is the third line from the `input`.

Since `data[3]` is not explicitly provided in the initial state, we can't determine the exact numeric values of `n`, `x`, and `y`. However, we know that `data[3]` is expected to be a string of space-separated integers.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` is 1; `idx` is 3; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from splitting and converting `data[3]` to integers; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from `data[2]` to integers.**

In simpler terms, `n`, `x`, and `y` have been updated to the integer values obtained from splitting `data[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
