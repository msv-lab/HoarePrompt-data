The code snippet provided takes the `input` string and splits it into lines, storing the result in the variable `data`. The `test_cases` list and the `input` string remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5), integers `x` and `y` (1 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9), and a list `arr` of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9); `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`.**
