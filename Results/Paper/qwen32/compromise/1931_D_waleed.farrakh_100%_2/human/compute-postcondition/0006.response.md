The code snippet splits the string at `data[idx]` by spaces and maps each part to an integer, then unpacks these integers into the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. Given that `idx` is 1, the second element of the `data` list is used for this operation. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be specific integers based on the content of `data[1]`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is 1; `n` is the first integer from `data[1]`; `x` is the second integer from `data[1]`; `y` is the third integer from `data[1]`.**
