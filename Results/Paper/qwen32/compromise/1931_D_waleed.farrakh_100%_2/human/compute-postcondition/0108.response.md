Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing Polycarp's first favorite integer), `y` (an integer representing Polycarp's second favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array). The function returns `results`, which is a list containing the final count values for each tuple in the original `test_cases` list. If `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is also an empty list.**
