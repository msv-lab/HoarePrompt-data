Postcondition: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is incremented by the value associated with the key `(rx, ry)` in `freq`, and the value associated with the key `(rx, ry)` in `freq` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `freq` includes the key `(rx, ry)` with the value `1` and `count` remains unchanged. `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `a` is the next element in `arr`.**
