Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, where the first tuple contains `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers with at least one element). `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which has been incremented by `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` was in `freq`. `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the tuple `(rx, ry)`. `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`. `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`. `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`. `a` is `a_next`, where `a_next` is the next element in `arr`.**

In simpler terms: The `current_pair` has been updated to `(a % x, a % y)`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` have been updated to the next tuple in `test_cases`. The variable `a` has been updated to the next element in `arr`, and `rx` and `ry` have been recalculated based on this new `a`. All other variables retain their previous states.
