The code snippet provided is:
```python
ry = a % y
```
However, there is no variable `a` defined in the initial state. Given the information, it seems there might be a typo, and `a` should be `arr[0]` based on the context of the problem. Assuming `a` is indeed `arr[0]`, the code would be:
```python
ry = arr[0] % y
```

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element.
- `results` contains the final value of `count`.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
- `count` is 0.
- `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`.

After executing `ry = arr[0] % y`, the value of `ry` will be calculated as the remainder of `arr[0]` divided by `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`; `count` is 0; `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `arr[0] % y`.**
