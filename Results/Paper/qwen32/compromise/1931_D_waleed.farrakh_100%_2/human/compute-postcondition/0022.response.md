In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over `results`. Therefore, the state of `results` is the only one that can be directly adjusted to ensure the loop executes. 

To ensure that the loop can execute, `results` must contain at least one element. However, based on the given state, `results` is the output of `func_1(test_cases)`, so we need to ensure that `func_1(test_cases)` produces a list with at least one element. This, in turn, depends on the contents of `test_cases`.

Since `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1, so `test_cases` is not empty. This will ensure that `func_1(test_cases)` is called with a non-empty list, potentially producing a non-empty `results` list.

Given the provided state, the only variable we can directly adjust in the loop head is `results`. However, to indirectly ensure that `results` is not empty, we need to set `t` to at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples `((n, x, y, arr), ...)`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` must contain at least one element**
