The code snippet provided increments the variable `idx` by 2. Therefore, the value of `idx` will change from 5 to 7. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing three tuples `((n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr))`; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` is 1; `idx` is 7; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from splitting and converting `data[5]` to integers; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from `data[6]` to integers.**
