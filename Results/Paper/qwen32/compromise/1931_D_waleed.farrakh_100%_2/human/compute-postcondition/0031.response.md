The code snippet `freq[current_pair] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `current_pair` in the dictionary `freq` by 1. If `current_pair` was not already a key in `freq`, it will be added with a value of 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers); `results` is an empty list; `freq` is a dictionary that contains the `current_pair` as a key with its corresponding value incremented by 1 if `current_pair` was already in `freq`, or with a value of 1 if `current_pair` was not in `freq`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `a` is `next_a`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is incremented by `freq[(rx, ry)]`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**
