The code snippet updates the variable `arr` by reading a new list of integers from `data[idx + 1]`. Given the initial state, `idx` is 3, so `arr` is reassigned to the list of integers obtained by splitting and converting `data[4]` to integers.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` is 1; `idx` is 3; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from splitting and converting `data[3]` to integers; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from `data[4]` to integers.**
