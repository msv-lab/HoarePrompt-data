The code snippet `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. This means that the `results` list will now include the new value of `count` at the end of its current elements. The values of `test_cases`, `freq`, and `count` remain unchanged except for `results` which is updated to include the new value of `count`.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has `n` elements; `results` contains the final value of `count` which is the sum of all previous occurrences of each `(rx, ry)` pair encountered, and now includes the new value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique `(a % x, a % y)` pair in `arr`.**
