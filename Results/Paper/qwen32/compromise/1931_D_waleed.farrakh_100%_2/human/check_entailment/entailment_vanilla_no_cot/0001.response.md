### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find pairs of indices (i, j) such that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

2. **Mathematical Conditions**:
   - For `a_i + a_j` to be divisible by `x`, we need `(a_i % x) + (a_j % x) ≡ 0 (mod x)`, which means `(a_i % x) ≡ -(a_j % x) (mod x)`.
   - For `a_i - a_j` to be divisible by `y`, we need `(a_i % y) ≡ (a_j % y) (mod y)`.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program uses a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the number of elements with a specific pair of remainders `(rx, ry)`, where `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y`.
   - For each element `a` in the array, it calculates `rx` and `ry` and checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, it adds the count of that pair to the result `count`.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current element's remainder pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the remainders and checks the required conditions.
   - It efficiently uses a frequency dictionary to count the number of valid pairs, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 2 * 10^5 elements in total across all test cases).
   - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the remainder is always non-negative, which is necessary for the dictionary keys.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array as per the given problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
