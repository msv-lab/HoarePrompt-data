### Reasoning:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together meet the problem description. The problem requires us to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case, where a pair \((i, j)\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

Let's analyze the provided functions:

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Purpose**: To compute the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
- **Method**:
  - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((a \% x, a \% y)\).
  - For each element `a` in the array, it calculates `rx` and `ry` where `rx` is the effective remainder of \(-a\) modulo `x` and `ry` is the remainder of `a` modulo `y`.
  - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the count because it indicates that there are previous elements that can form a beautiful pair with the current element.
  - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
- **Output**: A list of counts of beautiful pairs for each test case.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Purpose**: To read input, process it into test cases, and print the results.
- **Method**:
  - It reads all input lines at once.
  - It parses the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
  - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the array `arr`.
  - It collects these test cases into a list.
  - It calls `func_1` with the list of test cases.
  - It prints the results returned by `func_1`.

### Verification:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**: The function correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic. The use of `rx` ensures that the condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) is checked correctly by considering the effective remainder of \(-a_j\). The use of `ry` ensures that the condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) is checked correctly. The frequency dictionary helps efficiently count the number of previous elements that can form a beautiful pair with the current element.
- **Correctness of `func_2`**: The function correctly reads and processes the input to form test cases and then calls `func_1` to compute the results. It prints the results as required.

Since both functions work together to correctly process the input and compute the number of beautiful pairs for each test case, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
