Postcondition: **`t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where keys are player identifiers (strings) and values are their current positions on the field (pairs of integers). If the position of the player identified by `p` was equal to `blud`, then the position of the player identified by `p` is now `[-1, -1]` and `out` is a list containing the player identifier `p`. Otherwise, the position of the player identified by `p` remains unchanged and `out` is still an empty list. `blud` is a pair of integers representing the current position of the Bludger on the field.**
