Correctness: **False**

The provided code snippets do not fully implement the solution to the problem. They only handle some of the functionalities described in the problem statement, such as moving an object and checking for eliminations due to the Bludger. However, the code does not handle the following crucial aspects of the problem:

1. **Reading the input field and parsing the entities**: The code does not read the initial state of the field, which includes the positions of all players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.

2. **Processing the actions**: The code does not process the actions described in the input, which include moving entities, catching the Quaffle, and throwing the Quaffle.

3. **Checking for goals**: The code does not check if the Quaffle is placed in a goal and updating the score accordingly.

4. **Handling the Quaffle's position**: The code does not keep track of the Quaffle's position or ensure it moves to the middle of the field when a goal is scored.

5. **Printing the final score**: The code does not print the final score at the end of the game.

6. **Handling the elimination of players**: The elimination function (`func_2`) does not correctly handle the elimination of players based on the presence of the Bludger.

To correctly solve the problem, the code needs to be expanded to include these functionalities.
