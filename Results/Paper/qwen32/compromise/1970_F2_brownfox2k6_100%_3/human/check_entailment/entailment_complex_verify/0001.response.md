### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem described.

#### Function 1: `func_1(obj, d)`
- **Purpose**: This function is intended to move an object (`obj`) in a specified direction (`d`).
- **Implementation**: The function correctly modifies the coordinates of `obj` based on the direction (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
- **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the function updates the coordinates correctly for each direction.

#### Function 2: `func_2(t)`
- **Purpose**: This function is intended to check for Bludger collisions and eliminate players who collide with the Bludger.
- **Implementation**: The function iterates over players, checks if their position matches the Bludger's position, and if so, marks the player as eliminated and prints the elimination message.
- **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the function correctly identifies and eliminates players who collide with the Bludger.

#### Main Program Logic:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the dimensions of the field (`N`, `M`).
   - It then reads the initial state of the field, identifying the positions of goals (`RG`, `BG`), the Quaffle (`.Q`), the Bludger (`.B`), and players (`R0`, ..., `R9`, `B0`, ..., `B9`).
   - The initial positions are stored in appropriate data structures (`rg`, `bg`, `ball`, `blud`, `player`).

2. **Game Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of steps (`T`).
   - It then processes each step, updating the game state based on the actions specified:
     - **Movement**: If the action is `U`, `D`, `L`, or `R`, the corresponding entity is moved.
     - **Catch**: If the action is `C`, the player catches the Quaffle.
     - **Throw**: If the action is `T`, the player throws the Quaffle, and the score is updated if the Quaffle is in a goal.
   - After each action, the program checks for Bludger collisions and eliminates players if necessary.

3. **Scoring**:
   - The program updates the score when a player successfully scores in the opposing team's goal.
   - If a player scores in their own goal, the opposing team gets the point.

4. **Printing Events**:
   - The program prints the events of the game as required, including scoring goals and player eliminations.
   - At the end of the game, the program prints the final score.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations provide detailed states of the program at key points, confirming that the logic for movement, catching, throwing, scoring, and player elimination is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the full logic required to solve the problem. It initializes the game state, processes each step of the game, updates the game state accordingly, handles the required actions, and prints the events and final score as specified in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
