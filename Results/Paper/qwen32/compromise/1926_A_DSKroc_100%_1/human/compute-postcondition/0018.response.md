Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32; `s` is the input string that must have at least one character; `i` is the next character in the string `s` (the character following the one processed in the previous iteration). If `i` is 'A', `ac` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bc` is incremented by 1.**
