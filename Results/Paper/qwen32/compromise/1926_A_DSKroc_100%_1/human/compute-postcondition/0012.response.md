The code snippet `ac += 1` increments the variable `ac` by 1. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32; `s` is the input string that must have at least one character; `i` is the next character in the string `s`; `ac` is incremented by 1.**
