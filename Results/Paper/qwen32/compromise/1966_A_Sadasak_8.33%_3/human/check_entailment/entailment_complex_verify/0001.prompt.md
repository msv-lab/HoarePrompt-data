You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

        print(n)
    elif k == n:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)

    return frequency_table
    #The program returns `frequency_table`, which is a dictionary where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to reduce the number of cards in your hand by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards with any numbers. The objective is to find the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing any number of such operations.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cards) and `k` (number of cards to exchange).
   - It then reads the list of `n` integers representing the card numbers.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards:**
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the minimum number of cards is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, you can perform exactly one operation, reducing the number of cards to `k - 1`.
   - Otherwise, the program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get a frequency table where each number's count is capped at `k`.
   - The program then checks if `k` is a value in the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n`.

3. **Function `func_1(arr, k)`:**
   - This function creates a frequency table of card numbers but caps the frequency of each number at `k`.
   - This part of the logic is flawed. The frequency table should not cap the frequency at `k` because the number of cards of a particular number can be more than `k`, and we need to consider the total count to decide the minimum number of cards left.

### Flaw in the Program:
- The function `func_1` incorrectly caps the frequency of each number at `k`. This means it does not correctly account for the total number of cards of each number, which is necessary to determine the minimum number of cards left.
- The condition `if k in freq.values():` is not a reliable way to determine the minimum number of cards left. The actual logic should involve calculating the remainder of the division of the frequency of each number by `k - 1` and summing these remainders.

### Correctness:
Given the flaws in the logic, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the operations as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
