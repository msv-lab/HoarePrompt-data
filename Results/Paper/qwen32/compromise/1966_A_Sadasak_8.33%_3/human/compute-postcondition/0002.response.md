Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, `k` is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation such that 2 <= k <= 100 and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.**
