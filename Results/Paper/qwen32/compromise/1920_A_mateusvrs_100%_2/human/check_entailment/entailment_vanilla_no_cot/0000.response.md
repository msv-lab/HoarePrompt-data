Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the constraints correctly. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that constraints of type 3 (not equal to some integer) should only reduce the count if the integer they refer to is within the range defined by the constraints of type 1 and 2.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = float('inf')
        bx = float('-inf')
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')

# Call the function to execute the program
func()
```

However, the issue lies in the initialization of `ax` and `bx`. The original code initializes `ax` to a large number and `bx` to a small number, but it should initialize `ax` to positive infinity and `bx` to negative infinity to correctly capture the minimum and maximum bounds. The logic in the loop and the final calculation are correct.

Here is the corrected version with proper initialization:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = float('inf')
        bx = float('-inf')
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')

# Call the function to execute the program
func()
```

Since the original code initializes `ax` and `bx` incorrectly, the answer is **False**.
