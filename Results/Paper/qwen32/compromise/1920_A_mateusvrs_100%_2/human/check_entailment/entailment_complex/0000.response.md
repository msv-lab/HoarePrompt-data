### Reasoning:

The program correctly processes each test case by determining the valid range for `k` based on the constraints provided, and then calculates the number of integers within that range that are not excluded by any "not equal to" constraints.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `r` is a list that will store the results for each test case.
   - `cx` is a set that will store all integers that `k` cannot be (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`), representing the upper bound of `k`.
   - `bx` is initialized to `-1`, representing the lower bound of `k`.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the type `a` and the value `x` are read.
   - If `a` is `1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x` (since `k` must be `>= x`).
   - If `a` is `2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x` (since `k` must be `<= x`).
   - If `a` is `3`, `x` is added to the set `cx` (since `k` cannot be `x`).

3. **Calculating Valid Integers**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means there are no integers that can satisfy both the `>=` and `<=` constraints, so the result for this test case is `0`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[bx, ax]` by subtracting the count of integers in `cx` that fall within this range.

4. **Output**:
   - The results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. It adheres to the problem's requirements and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
