You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of constraints of three types. For each test case, it calculates the count of integers within a specific range that are not listed in a set of excluded integers. The result for each test case is either 0 if the range is invalid, or the count of integers within the range that are not excluded.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where `bx` (the maximum lower bound) is equal to `ax` (the minimum upper bound). In such cases, there might still be valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints, but the program incorrectly returns `0`.

Let's consider an example:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 5
2 5
3 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of the Example:**
- `k >= 5` (from constraint `1 5`)
- `k <= 5` (from constraint `2 5`)
- `k != 6` (from constraint `3 6`)

The only possible value for `k` that satisfies all these constraints is `5`. However, the program will calculate `bx` as `5` and `ax` as `5`, and since `cx` (the set of excluded values) does not contain `5`, it will incorrectly compute `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` as `5 - 5 + 1 - 0 = 1`, but it will then return `0` because `bx` and `ax` are equal.

To fix this, the program should handle the case where `bx == ax` separately and check if that value is in the set of excluded values `cx`. If it is not, then the answer should be `1`; otherwise, it should be `0`.

Here's a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
if bx > ax:
    r.append(0)
elif bx == ax:
    r.append(0 if bx in cx else 1)
else:
    tmp = 0
    for i in cx:
        if i >= bx and i <= ax:
            tmp += 1
    r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
```

With this correction, the program would correctly handle the edge case where `bx` equals `ax`.
