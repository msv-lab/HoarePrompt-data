You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case. No two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

    #State: `r` is a list containing the results of processing each test case as described, with each test case contributing either a 0 (if `bx > ax`) or the count of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` excluding those in `cx` (if `bx <= ax`).
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: Each element of the list `r` on a new line, where each element is either 0 or the count of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` excluding those in `cx` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of constraints of three types. For each test case, it calculates the count of integers within a specific range that are not listed in a set of excluded integers. The result for each test case is either 0 if the range is invalid, or the count of integers within the range that are not excluded.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Initialization**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - For each test case, the program reads the number of constraints `n`.
    - It initializes `cx` as an empty set to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3 (not equal to).
    - It initializes `ax` to a large value (1000000000 + 7) and `bx` to -1. `ax` will store the minimum value for constraints of type 2 (less than or equal to), and `bx` will store the maximum value for constraints of type 1 (greater than or equal to).

3. **Reading Constraints**:
    - For each constraint, the program reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
    - If `a` is 1 (greater than or equal to), it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
    - If `a` is 2 (less than or equal to), it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
    - If `a` is 3 (not equal to), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Calculating the Result**:
    - If `bx` (the minimum value `k` must be greater than or equal to) is greater than `ax` (the maximum value `k` must be less than or equal to), it means there are no valid values of `k` that can satisfy all constraints, so it appends 0 to the results list `r`.
    - Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`. It does this by iterating over `cx` and counting how many of these values are in the range `[bx, ax]`. It then subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` (which is `ax - bx + 1`) and appends the result to `r`.

5. **Output**:
    - Finally, it prints all the results stored in `r`, each on a new line.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The logic for updating `bx` and `ax` and the calculation of the result are correct. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
