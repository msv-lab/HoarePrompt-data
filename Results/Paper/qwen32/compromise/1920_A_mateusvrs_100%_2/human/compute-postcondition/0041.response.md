The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the set `cx`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx` and the variable `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was an element of `cx`, and `cx` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to the next element in `cx`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set of all `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2 such that `cx` must have at least one element, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `tmp` is incremented by 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`. `i` is the next element in `cx`.**

Since sets are unordered, we cannot definitively state which element `i` will be set to next. However, we know that `i` must be an element of `cx` and different from the previous value of `i`. The state of `cx` does not need to be adjusted because it is the collection being iterated over.
