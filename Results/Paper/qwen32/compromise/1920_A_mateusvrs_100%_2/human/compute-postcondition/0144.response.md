The provided code snippet appends a value to the list `r`. The value being appended is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. 

Given the initial state, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`. Therefore, the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are **not** in `cx`.

After the execution of the code snippet, the list `r` will have an additional element, which is the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`r` has an additional element equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`**.
