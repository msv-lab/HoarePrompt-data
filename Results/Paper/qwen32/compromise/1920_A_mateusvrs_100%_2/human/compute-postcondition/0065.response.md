Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and its previous value. If `a` is not equal to 1, then if `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and its original value; otherwise, `cx` includes the value of `x`.**
