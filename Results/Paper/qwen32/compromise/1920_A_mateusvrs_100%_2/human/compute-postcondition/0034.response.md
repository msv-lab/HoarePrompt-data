Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is a list containing the value 0, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, and `cx` is a set of all `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. The current value of `bx` is greater than `ax`.**

In natural language: The list `r` now contains the value 0, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx`) remain unchanged.
