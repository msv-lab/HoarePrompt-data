The code snippet `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This means the values of `a` and `x` are updated based on the input, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `a` and `x` are updated to the values provided by the input. The values of `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, and `r` depend on the new values of `a` and `x`.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`, `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions, `n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.**
