The code appends a new value to the list `r`. The new value is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. After this operation, `r` will have one additional element, while the other variables (`ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3, `r` is `[0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` initially and now is `[0, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the initial conditions, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**
