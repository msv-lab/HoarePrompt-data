Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is the input integer, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, and `r` is a list containing the value 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and its previous value. If `a` is not equal to 1, then if `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and its original value; otherwise, `cx` includes the value of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and its previous value. If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and its original value. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` includes the value of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than the current value of `_` + 1; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input; `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` remains unchanged; if `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of the current `x` and the previous `ax`, otherwise `ax` remains unchanged and `cx` contains the previous elements plus `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
