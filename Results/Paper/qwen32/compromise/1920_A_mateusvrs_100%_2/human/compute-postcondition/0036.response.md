The provided code snippet initializes a variable `tmp` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `r`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, and `cx` is a set of all `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. `tmp` is 0.**
