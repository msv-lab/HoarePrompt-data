The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of the current value of `ax` and the value of `x`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `ax`, we can only determine that `ax` will be set to the smaller of its previous value and `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `r` is an empty list
- `a` is the first integer from the new input
- `x` is the second integer from the new input
- `ax` is not specified in the initial state, but it will be updated by the code snippet

After executing the code snippet, the value of `ax` will be the minimum of its previous value and `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `r` is an empty list, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is the second integer from the new input, `ax` is the minimum of its previous value and `x`.**
