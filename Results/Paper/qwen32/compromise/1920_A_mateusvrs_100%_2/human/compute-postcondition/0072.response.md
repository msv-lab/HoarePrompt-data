Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and its previous value. If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and its original value. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` includes the value of `x`.**
