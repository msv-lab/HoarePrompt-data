To determine the final state of the loop, we need to consider how the loop modifies the variables `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` based on the input values `a` and `x` for each iteration.

The initial state is:
- `ax` is 1000000007
- `bx` is -1
- `cx` is an empty set
- `r` is dependent on conditions involving `tmp` and `bx`
- `n` is the number of iterations

The loop runs `n` times, and in each iteration, it updates `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` based on the value of `a`:
- If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`.
- If `a` is 3, `cx` adds `x` to the set.

Let's summarize the final state after `n` iterations:
- `ax` will be the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` is 2.
- `bx` will be the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` is 1.
- `cx` will be a set containing all unique `x` inputs where `a` is 3.
- `r` remains dependent on the conditions involving `tmp` and `bx`, but since `tmp` is not provided, we can't determine its exact value. However, it doesn't change based on the loop iterations.
- `n` is 0 after all iterations.

Given the above, the final output state is:

Output State: **`ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` where `a` is 3, `r` remains the same as per its initial conditions, `n` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `ax` will hold the smallest value seen when `a` was 2, `bx` will hold the largest value seen when `a` was 1, and `cx` will be a set of all unique values seen when `a` was 3. The loop counter `n` will be zero, and `r` will remain as it was initially defined.
