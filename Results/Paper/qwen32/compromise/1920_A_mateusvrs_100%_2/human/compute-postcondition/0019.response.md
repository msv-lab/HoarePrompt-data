The code snippet `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x` respectively. The initial state specifies that `a` and `x` are already assigned values, but these values are overwritten by the new input values. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `r`, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is the second integer from the new input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` equals 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` is a set containing the value `x`.**
