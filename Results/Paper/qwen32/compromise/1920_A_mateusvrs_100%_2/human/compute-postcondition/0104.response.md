Output State: **`ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input`**

In simple terms, the variables `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, and the condition on `n` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `x` are assigned the values of the two integers provided as input.
