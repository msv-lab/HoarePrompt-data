Output State: **`ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` where `a` is 3, `r` remains the same as per its initial conditions, `n` is 0, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `tmp` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their values remain as per the initial state.
