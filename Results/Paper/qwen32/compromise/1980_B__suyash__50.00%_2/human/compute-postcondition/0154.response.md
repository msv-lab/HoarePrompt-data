Postcondition: **`l` is a list with at least one unique element, `i` is 0, and `fav` is compared with `l[0]`. If `fav` is not equal to `l[0]`, `k` is updated to `k - dic[l[0]]`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues without any further changes to the variables. If `fav` is equal to `l[0]`, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[0]]`. If the resulting value of `k` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `k` is greater than or equal to 0.**
