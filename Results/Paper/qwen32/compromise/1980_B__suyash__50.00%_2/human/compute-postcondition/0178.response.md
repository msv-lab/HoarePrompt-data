Postcondition: **`l` is a list with at least one unique element, `i` is 2. If `fav` is not equal to `l[2]`, then `k` is decreased by `dic[l[2]]` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `fav` is equal to `l[2]`, then `k` is updated to `k - dic[l[2]]`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0 in this case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without further modification of `k`. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `k` further.**
