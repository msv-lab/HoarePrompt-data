To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(p1 + p2)`, let's break down the given information:

- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, i.e., `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0`.

We need to find the value of `p1 + p2` based on the provided constraints.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, we can only describe the printed output in terms of these variables. However, we know that the sum `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd. This means that the sum of `p1 + p2` and `p3` must be odd. Therefore, `p1 + p2` and `p3` must have different parities (one is odd, the other is even).

The exact numerical value of `p1 + p2` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `p1` and `p2`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ 30 and the sum p1 + p2 + p3 is odd)**
