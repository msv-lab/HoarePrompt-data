The code calculates the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and `p1` and `p3` and `p2`, and assigns these values to `low` and `high` respectively. Given the initial conditions, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.**
