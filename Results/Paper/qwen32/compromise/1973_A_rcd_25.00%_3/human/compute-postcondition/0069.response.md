Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1`, `cur` is `p3 - p2`. Additionally, `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
