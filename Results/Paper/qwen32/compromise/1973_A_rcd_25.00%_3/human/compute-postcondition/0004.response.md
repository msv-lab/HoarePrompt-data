The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the value `-1`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value printed is solely dependent on the `print(-1)` statement itself.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
2. It also specifies that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and their sum is odd.
3. The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(-1)`, which directly outputs the integer `-1`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the initial state variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`), the output is simply the value `-1`.

Output: **-1**
