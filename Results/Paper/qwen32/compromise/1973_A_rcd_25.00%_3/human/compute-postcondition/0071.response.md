The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, still holds. Additionally, `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1`, and `cur` is now `p3 - p2 + 1`. The condition `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)` may or may not still hold, but we do not have specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to determine this.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1`, `cur` is `p3 - p2 + 1`.**
