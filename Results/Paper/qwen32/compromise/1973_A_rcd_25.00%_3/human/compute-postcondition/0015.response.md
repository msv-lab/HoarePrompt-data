Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `low` is `p3 - p2`; `high` is `p3 - p1`; `cur` is `low`; and it holds that `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
