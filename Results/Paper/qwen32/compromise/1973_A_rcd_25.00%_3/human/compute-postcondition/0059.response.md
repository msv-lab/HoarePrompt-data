The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Given that the initial state specifies `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are already defined integers that meet certain conditions, the execution of the provided code will overwrite these variables with the new input values. However, the precondition that `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30` and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd will still hold true after the code is executed, assuming the input adheres to these conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
