To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute its first iteration, we need to focus on the variables used in the loop condition: `high` and `cur`.

Given:
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is initially set to `low`, which is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

The loop condition is `high >= cur`. Since `cur` is initialized to `low`, and `high` is the maximum of the two differences, it is always true that `high >= cur` unless there is a specific scenario where `high` is less than `cur`. However, given the definitions of `high` and `cur`, this situation cannot occur because `high` is defined as the larger of the two differences, and `cur` is defined as the smaller of the two differences.

Therefore, with the given definitions and initializations, the loop condition `high >= cur` will always be true, and no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`**
