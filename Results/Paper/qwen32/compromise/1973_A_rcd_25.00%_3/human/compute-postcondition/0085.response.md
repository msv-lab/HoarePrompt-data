To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: The variable `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` (where `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`) are read from the input.

2. **Loop Execution**:
    - For each test case, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is checked to see if it is odd. If it is, `-1` is printed, and the loop continues to the next test case.
    - If the sum is even, the program further checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`.
    - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program enters a while loop to find a value `cur` such that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If such a `cur` is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`. If no such `cur` is found, it prints `p3`.

3. **Output State after All Iterations**:
    - After all `t` test cases have been processed, the loop will have printed a result for each test case.
    - The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will have been updated to the values of the current test case being processed within the loop.
    - The variable `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0, at which point the loop terminates.

Given the above understanding, the final output state after all iterations is that all test cases have been processed and the loop has terminated. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be those of the last test case processed, and `t` will be 0.

Output State: **The loop has processed all `t` test cases and terminated. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` hold the values of the last test case, and `t` is 0.**
