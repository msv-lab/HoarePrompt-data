To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute its first iteration, we need to analyze the condition `high >= cur`. The variables `high` and `cur` are defined as follows:
- `high` is `p3 - p1`
- `cur` is `p3 - p2`

The loop condition `high >= cur` translates to `p3 - p1 >= p3 - p2`. Simplifying this, we get `p2 >= p1`, which is already ensured by the problem statement that `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`.

Given that the condition `p2 >= p1` is already satisfied, the loop can execute its first iteration with the provided state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `high` and `cur` based on the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1`, `cur` is `p3 - p2`**
