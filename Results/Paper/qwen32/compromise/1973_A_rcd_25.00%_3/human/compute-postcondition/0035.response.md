Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is already given to be odd, the condition `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` will always be true, and the else part will never execute. Thus, the state of the variables remains unchanged after the if-else block.**
