To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables `high` and `cur` according to the loop condition `high >= cur`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `low` is `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is `p3 - p1`.
- `cur` is determined by the condition: if `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` remains `p3 - p2`. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `p3 - p2 + 1`.

From the loop condition `high >= cur`, we need to ensure that `high` is at least as large as `cur` for the loop to execute again.

Let's analyze the possible values:
- `high` is `p3 - p1`.
- `cur` can be either `p3 - p2` or `p3 - p2 + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- If `cur` is `p3 - p2`, then `high` must be at least `p3 - p2`.
- If `cur` is `p3 - p2 + 1`, then `high` must be at least `p3 - p2 + 1`.

Since `high` is `p3 - p1` and `p1 ≤ p2`, `p3 - p1` is always greater than or equal to `p3 - p2`. Therefore, `high` is already at least `p3 - p2`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `cur` is not already the maximum possible value that would prevent the loop from executing again. The maximum value `cur` can take is `p3 - p1` (which is `high`). Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, `cur` should be less than `high`.

Thus, the state should be adjusted such that `cur` is less than `high`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1`, and `cur` is less than `high`**.
