The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. This means the initial values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, then `p3` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `p3` remains unchanged as well (this condition does not affect the assignment in the code snippet).

Since the code snippet only reads new values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, the value of `t` remains unchanged. The new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are determined by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
