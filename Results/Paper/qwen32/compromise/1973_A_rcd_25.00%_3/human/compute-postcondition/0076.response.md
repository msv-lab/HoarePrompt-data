The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1`, and `cur` is now `cur + 1` and still less than `high`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1`, and `cur` is `cur + 1` and still less than `high`.**
