Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Three friends play chess games against each other.
- Each game results in:
  - 2 points for the winner, 0 for the loser (if there's a winner).
  - 1 point for each player (if it's a draw).
- We are given the scores of the three players in non-decreasing order (p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3).
- We need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened.
- If the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games, we should return -1.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it:
1. Checks if the total points (p1 + p2 + p3) are even. If not, it prints -1 (since each game results in an even number of points).
2. If p3 ≥ p1 + p2, it prints p1 + p2, suggesting that the maximum number of draws is the sum of the lower two scores.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the range between p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 and iterates through this range to find a valid number of draws.
4. If a valid number of draws is found, it prints the number of draws; otherwise, it prints p3.

### Test Cases Analysis:
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases and some additional edge cases.

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Input:** 0 0 0
   - **Output:** 0
   - **Explanation:** No games played, so no draws.
2. **Input:** 0 1 1
   - **Output:** 1
   - **Explanation:** One draw between the second and third player.
3. **Input:** 1 1 1
   - **Output:** -1
   - **Explanation:** Impossible to have these scores with the given rules.
4. **Input:** 1 1 2
   - **Output:** 2
   - **Explanation:** Two games (one draw and one win/loss).
5. **Input:** 3 3 3
   - **Output:** -1
   - **Explanation:** Impossible to have these scores with the given rules.
6. **Input:** 3 4 5
   - **Output:** 6
   - **Explanation:** Six games (three draws and three wins/losses).
7. **Input:** 1 1 10
   - **Output:** 2
   - **Explanation:** Two draws and four wins/losses.

#### Additional Test Cases:
1. **Input:** 0 0 2
   - **Output:** 1
   - **Explanation:** One game with a winner and one draw.
2. **Input:** 2 2 4
   - **Output:** 2
   - **Explanation:** Two games with one draw and one win/loss.
3. **Input:** 0 2 4
   - **Output:** 2
   - **Explanation:** Two games with one draw and one win/loss.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the provided example test cases correctly. However, let's try to find any potential edge cases or inconsistencies that the program might not handle correctly.

### Edge Case Analysis:
1. **Scores with Total Points Odd:**
   - **Input:** 0 1 2
   - **Output:** -1
   - **Explanation:** The total points are 3, which is odd, so no valid set of games can produce these scores. The program correctly returns -1.

2. **Scores with Maximum Draws:**
   - **Input:** 0 0 0
   - **Output:** 0
   - **Explanation:** No games played, so no draws. The program correctly returns 0.

3. **Scores with Impossibility:**
   - **Input:** 1 1 1
   - **Output:** -1
   - **Explanation:** Impossible to have these scores with the given rules. The program correctly returns -1.

4. **Scores with Valid Draws:**
   - **Input:** 1 1 2
   - **Output:** 2
   - **Explanation:** Two games (one draw and one win/loss). The program correctly returns 2.

Based on the analysis, the program handles the provided test cases and additional edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program seems to correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
