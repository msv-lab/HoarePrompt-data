Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, and then counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string. It prints the sum of these two counts for each test case.**
