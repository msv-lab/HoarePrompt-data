Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's the analysis:

1. The program counts the number of occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s`.
2. It then removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s` and counts the number of occurrences of "pie" in the modified string.
3. Finally, it prints the sum of these counts as the number of characters to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

However, this approach is incorrect because removing all occurrences of "map" first can introduce new occurrences of "pie" that were not present in the original string. For example, consider the string "mappie". If we remove "map", we are left with "pie", which is a substring that needs to be counted as well. Therefore, the removal of one substring can affect the count of the other.

The correct approach would involve finding the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears in the string. This can be achieved using dynamic programming or other advanced techniques to avoid the pitfalls of the greedy approach used in the provided program.
