Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them up to determine the minimum number of deletions required. However, simply counting the occurrences of these substrings does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to avoid these substrings.

For example, consider the input string "ppiepiepie". The program would count three occurrences of "pie" and output 3, but the actual minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful is 2 (by removing two 'p's).

Here is a counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  11
  ppiepiepie
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```
- Actual Output from the program:
  ```
  3
  ```

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
