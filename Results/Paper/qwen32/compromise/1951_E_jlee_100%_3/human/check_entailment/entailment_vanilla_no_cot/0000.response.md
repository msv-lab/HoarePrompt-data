Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and does not always provide the correct partitioning when possible.

Here are some issues and counterexamples:

1. **Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and outputs "NO". However, this is handled correctly in the code.

2. **Strings with Repeated Characters**: The program correctly identifies that a string consisting of the same character repeated cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and outputs "NO". However, this is also handled correctly in the code.

3. **Strings with Mixed Characters**: The program attempts to identify whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings but does so incorrectly in some cases. For example, consider the string "abba". The program should return "YES" with a partition like "ab" and "ba", but it incorrectly returns "NO".

4. **Incorrect Partitioning**: Even when the program identifies that a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, it does not always provide a correct partition. For example, for the string "uwuowouwu", the program might output "YES", "1", "uwuowouwu" instead of a valid partition like "uw", "uow", "ouwu".

5. **Logic Flaws**: The logic for identifying non-palindromic partitions is flawed. The program does not correctly handle cases where a string can be partitioned into multiple non-palindromic substrings.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be revised to correctly identify whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and to provide a valid partition when possible. A simpler and more reliable approach would be to check if the string itself is a palindrome. If it is not, then the string can be partitioned into itself as a single non-palindromic substring. If it is a palindrome, then the program should attempt to find a valid partition by checking substrings.

Here is a revised version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        if not is_palindrome(string):
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        else:
            found = False
            for j in range(1, n):
                if not is_palindrome(string[:j]) and not is_palindrome(string[j:]):
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This revised program correctly checks if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and provides a valid partition when possible.
