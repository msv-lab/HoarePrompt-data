Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `done` is `False`; `x` is the first character of `string`. If the count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, then every character in `s` is `x`. Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` in `s` is `x`. `count` is 0; `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input and has at least 1 character; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string` and is greater than 0; `x` is the first character of `string`; If the count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, then every character in `s` is `x`. Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` in `s` is `x`. `j` is 0; If `count` is greater than 0, then `count2` is not less than `count`, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is `True`. If `count` is 0, `done` retains its value based on the comparison of `s[j]` and `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input and has at least 1 character; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string` and is greater than 0; `x` is the first character of `string`; If the count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, then every character in `s` is `x`. Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` in `s` is `x`. `j` is 1; If `count` > 0, then if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is set to `True`. If `s[j] != x` and `count >= 1`, `done` is set to `True`. If `s[j] == x`, `count2` is increased by 1 and if `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True`. If `count` is not greater than 0, then no changes are made to `count` or `done`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input and has at least 1 character; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string` and is greater than 0; `x` is the first character of `string`; If the count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, then every character in `s` is `x`. Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` in `s` is `x`. `j` is 2. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` may have been incremented by 1 if `s[j] != x`. If `s[j] != x` and `count2 < count`, `done` is set to `True`. If `s[j] != x` and `count2 == count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to `True`. If `s[j] != x` and `count2 == count` and `count` is not greater than 1, `count2` is set to 0. If `s[j] != x` and `count2 > count`, `done` is set to `True`. If `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `done` retains its previous value. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count2` or `done`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
