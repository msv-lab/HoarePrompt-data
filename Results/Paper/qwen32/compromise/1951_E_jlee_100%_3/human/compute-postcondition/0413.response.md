The given code snippet only contains a `print('YES')` statement. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, and `done`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. 

Since the `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state, it will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
