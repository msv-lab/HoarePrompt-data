Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, but it's not used in the provided code snippet.
- `string` is the value of the input and has at least 1 character.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string` and is greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- There are specific conditions on the count of `x` in `s`:
  - If the count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, then every character in `s` is `x`.
  - Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`.
  - If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` in `s` is `x`.
- `j` is set to 2.
- `count` and `done` are not explicitly mentioned in the conditions, but their values are set based on certain conditions:
  - If `s[j] != x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
  - If `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `done`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Analysis:
- `j` is set to 2.
- `string[:j - 1]` translates to `string[:1]`, which is the substring of `string` from the start up to, but not including, the 1st index. This means it will print the first character of `string`.
- `string[j - 1:]` translates to `string[1:]`, which is the substring of `string` starting from the 1st index to the end of the string. This means it will print the string from the second character to the end.

### Output:
The print statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Final Output:
Output: **string[0], string[1:] (where string[0] is the first character of the string and string[1:] is the string from the second character to the end)**
