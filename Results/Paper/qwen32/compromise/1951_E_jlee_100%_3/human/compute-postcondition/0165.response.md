Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; If `n` is 1, then the conditions regarding the count of `x` in `s` and other variables remain as in the precondition. Otherwise, the conditions regarding the count of `x` in `s` and other variables remain as in the precondition. `count` is 0 or a value indicating the first non-x character; `count2` is 0 or a value indicating the number of `x` characters after `count`; `done` is False; `j` is `n` (indicating all iterations are completed); `i` is 0. Additionally, if `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`, then the conditions remain as described. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
