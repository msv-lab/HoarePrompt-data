Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 2; `i` is 0. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count2` is set to 0, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 2. Otherwise, `count` and `done` remain unchanged.**
