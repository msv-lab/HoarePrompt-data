Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `done` is `False`; `x` is the first character of `string`. The count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, meaning every character in `s` is `x`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`, then `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the state of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
