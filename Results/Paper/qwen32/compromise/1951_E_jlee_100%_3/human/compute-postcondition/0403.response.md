The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, as the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `j` is 2.**
