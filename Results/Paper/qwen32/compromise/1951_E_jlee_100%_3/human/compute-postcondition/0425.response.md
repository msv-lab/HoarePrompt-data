Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `j` is 2. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is exited; `count2` is 0.**
