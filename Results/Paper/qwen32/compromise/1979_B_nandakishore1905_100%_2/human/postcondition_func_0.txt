The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the absolute difference between the two integers and prints a specific result. The result is the largest power of 2 that divides the absolute difference if it is a power of 2, 1 if the difference is odd, or a derived value if the difference is even and not a power of 2.
