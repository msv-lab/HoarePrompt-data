The code `p = len(l)` updates the value of `p` to the length of the string `l`. Given that `l` is '11', the length of `l` is 2. Therefore, `p` is updated to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` and `m` are integers such that `abs(n - m) = 5`, `k` is `abs(n - m) = 5`, `l` is '11', `p` is 2, `f` is `k - 2 = 3`**
