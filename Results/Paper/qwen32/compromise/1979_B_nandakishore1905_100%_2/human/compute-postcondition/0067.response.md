The variable `q` is assigned the value `2 ** (p - 1)`, where `p` is the length of the binary string `l`, which is the binary representation of `k` (the absolute difference between `n` and `m`). The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `k` is `abs(n - m)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary string `l`, `q` is `2 ** (p - 1)`**.
