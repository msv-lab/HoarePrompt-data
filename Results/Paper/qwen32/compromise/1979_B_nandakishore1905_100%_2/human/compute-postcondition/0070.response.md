The code snippet `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `f` to its binary representation as a string and removes the '0b' prefix. Given that `f` is 3, its binary representation is '11'. Therefore, `l` is updated to '11'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` is 5, `m` is 0, `k` is 5, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is "11", `p` is 3, `q` is 2, `f` is 3**.
