Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    k = abs(n - m)
    if k & k - 1 == 0:
        print(k)
    elif k % 2 != 0:
        print(1)
    else:
        l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
        p = len(l)
        q = 2 ** (p - 1)
        f = k - q
        while f & f - 1 != 0:
            l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            f = f - q
        print(f)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, and `k` is `abs(n - m)`. If `k` is a power of 2, no additional variables are introduced. If `k` is not a power of 2, and `k` is odd, no additional variables are introduced. If `k` is not a power of 2 and `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k - 2` as a string, `p` is the length of the binary string `l`, `f` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k - 2`, and `q` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `k` is `abs(n - m)`. If `k` is a power of 2, no additional variables are introduced. If `k` is odd, no additional variables are introduced. If `k` is not a power of 2 and `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k - 2` as a string, `p` is the length of the binary string `l`, `f` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k - 2`, and `q` is 2. Additionally, if `k` is specifically 5, `l` is '11', `p` is 2, `f` is 1, and `q` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `k` is `abs(n - m)`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `k` is a power of 2 (i.e., `k & k - 1 == 0`), the state remains as described. If `k` is not a power of 2 and is odd, the state remains as described. If `k` is not a power of 2 and is even, `n` is set to 5, `m` is set to 0, `k` is set to 5, `l` is set to "11", `p` is set to 2, `q` is set to 2, and `f` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
