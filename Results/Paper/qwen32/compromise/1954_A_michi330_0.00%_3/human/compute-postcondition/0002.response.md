To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the code inside the loop. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then evaluates a condition to print either 'NO' or 'YES'.

The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` determines the output:
- If the condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Since the loop executes `t` times, and each iteration prints either 'NO' or 'YES', the output state will be a sequence of `t` lines, each containing either 'NO' or 'YES'. The exact sequence depends on the input values for each test case.

However, the problem asks for the output state in a specific format and only to describe the state of the variables involved in the loop head and body. Given that the loop modifies no variables outside its scope, the only state we can describe is the sequence of outputs.

Output State: **a sequence of t lines, each containing either 'NO' or 'YES', based on the input values for each test case.**
