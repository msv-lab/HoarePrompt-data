You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50) where n is the number of parts of the ribbon, m is the number of colors available, and k is the maximum number of parts Bob can repaint.

        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:

    #State: a sequence of t lines, each containing either 'NO' or 'YES', based on the input values for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Alice wants to paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting at most `k` parts.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The ribbon has `n` parts.
   - Alice can use `m` different colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts.
3. **Key Insight**:
   - If Alice can distribute the colors such that no single color is used for more than `n - k` parts, Bob cannot repaint all parts to the same color.
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color regardless of how Alice paints them.
   - If `n - ceil(n / m) < k`, Alice cannot distribute the colors such that the most frequent color is used for no more than `n - k` parts, because even if she distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint the necessary parts to make all parts the same color.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses the following logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- It checks two conditions:
  1. If `n <= k`, it prints 'NO' because Bob can repaint all parts.
  2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it prints 'NO' because Alice cannot prevent Bob from repainting all parts to the same color.
  3. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' because Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Verification:
- **First Condition (`n <= k`)**:
  - Correctly handles the scenario where Bob can repaint all parts.
- **Second Condition (`n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`)**:
  - Correctly handles the scenario where Alice cannot prevent Bob from repainting all parts to the same color even with optimal distribution.
- **Otherwise (`YES`)**:
  - Correctly handles the scenario where Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem analysis. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
