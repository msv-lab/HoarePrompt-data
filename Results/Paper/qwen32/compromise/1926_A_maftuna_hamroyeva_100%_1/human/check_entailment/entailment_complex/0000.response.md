### Reasoning:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `t` times, each time reading a string `a` of length 5 consisting of characters 'A' and 'B'.

2. **Counting Characters:**
   - For each string `a`, two counters `l` and `h` are initialized to zero. These counters are used to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively.
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `a`. If the character is 'A', it increments `l` by 1. Otherwise, it increments `h` by 1.

3. **Determining the Most Frequent Character:**
   - After counting the characters in the string, the program compares the values of `l` and `h`.
   - If `l` (the count of 'A') is greater than `h` (the count of 'B'), it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal by defaulting to printing 'B'. This behavior aligns with the problem statement, which does not specify what to do in the case of a tie, so we assume the given implementation is acceptable.
   - Since the problem guarantees that all strings are distinct and of length 5, the program does not need to handle any invalid input scenarios.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program outputs the character ('A' or 'B') that appears most frequently in the string.

### Conclusion:

The program accurately follows the problem requirements and produces the correct output for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

**Correctness: True**
