The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is being iterated over the string `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `j` and how it changes during each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32 (no change needed).
- `i` is 2 (no change needed as it's not part of the loop head).
- `a` is a non-empty string (no change needed).
- `j` is the second character in `a` (this needs to be updated to the next character in `a` for the next iteration).
- `l` is 2 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` is 1 (no change needed as it's not part of the loop head).
- `h` is 1 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `h` is 2 (no change needed as it's not part of the loop head).

Since `j` is currently the second character in `a`, for the next iteration, `j` should be the third character in `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the third character in `a`, `l` is 2 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` is 1, and `h` is 1 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `h` is 2**.
