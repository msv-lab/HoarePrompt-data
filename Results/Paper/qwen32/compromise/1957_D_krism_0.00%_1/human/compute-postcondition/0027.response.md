The code snippet provided increments the first element of the `j`-th sublist in the `suf` list by 1. Given that `j` is 0, this means the first element of the first sublist in `suf` will be incremented by 1.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9
- `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn]
- `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0]
- `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros
- `i` is `n`
- `cur` is `prefix[n]`
- `j` is 0
- The `j`-th bit of `cur` is 0

After executing the code `suf[j][0] += 1`, the first sublist in `suf` will be [1, 0] instead of [0, 0].

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists where the first sublist is [1, 0] and the rest are [0, 0], `i` is `n`, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, `j` is 0, and the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 0.**
