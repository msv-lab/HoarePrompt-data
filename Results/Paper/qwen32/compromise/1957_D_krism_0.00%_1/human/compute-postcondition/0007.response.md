The code appends a new value to the `prefix` list. This new value is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `prefix` and `v`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `v` remain unchanged. The `prefix` list now contains one additional element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v2, ..., vk, `v` ^ `prefix[-1]`], `v` is the k-th element of arr**.
