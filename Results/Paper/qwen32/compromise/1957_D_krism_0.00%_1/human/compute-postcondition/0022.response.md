The code assigns the value of `prefix[i]` to the variable `cur`. Given that `i` is `n`, `cur` will be assigned the value of `prefix[n]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, `i` is `n`, `cur` is `prefix[n]`**.
