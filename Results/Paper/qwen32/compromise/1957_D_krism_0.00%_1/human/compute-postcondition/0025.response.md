The given code snippet increments the second element of the `j`-th sublist in the `suf` list by 1. 

Since `j` is initialized to 0, the second element of the 0-th sublist in `suf` will be incremented by 1. Initially, each sublist in `suf` contains two zeros, so after the operation, the 0-th sublist in `suf` will be `[0, 1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where the 0-th sublist is [0, 1] and all other sublists are [0, 0], `i` is `n`, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, `j` is 0, and the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1.**
