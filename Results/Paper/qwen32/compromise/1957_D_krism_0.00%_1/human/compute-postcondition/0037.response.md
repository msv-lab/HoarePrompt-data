Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `suf[j]` is [x, y] such that x is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0, and y is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1, `i` is `n`, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, `j` is 32.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all 32 iterations, each sublist in `suf` will reflect how many times the corresponding bit in `cur` was 0 and how many times it was 1 across all iterations. The variable `j` will have reached the value 32, indicating that all iterations are complete. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `pre`) remain unchanged.
