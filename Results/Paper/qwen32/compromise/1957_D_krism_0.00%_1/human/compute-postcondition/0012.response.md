The provided code snippet initializes a list of lists named `pre` with 32 sublists, each containing two zeros. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, or `prefix`. The only change is the introduction of the new list `pre`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros.**
