### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program to see if it correctly computes Alice's maximum profit under optimal play by both Alice and Bob.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of items `n` and the number of items Bob can take for free `k`.
   - It then reads two lists: one for Alice's prices (`prices`) and another for Bob's prices (`bonuses`).

2. **Processing Items:**
   - The program creates a list `combined` where each element is a tuple containing the negative of Alice's price and Bob's price.
   - This list is sorted based on Bob's prices (`bonuses`).

3. **Initial Heap Setup:**
   - The program pushes the first `k` items from the sorted `combined` list into a min-heap (`heap`). This ensures that the least beneficial items for Alice (from Bob's perspective) are considered first for Bob to take for free.

4. **Calculating Initial Profit:**
   - If there are any items left in `combined` after pushing `k` items into the heap, the program calculates an initial `current_profit` using `func_3`. This function sums up the costs of the items in the heap and adds the net benefit (Bob's price minus Alice's price) of the remaining items in `combined`.

5. **Iterative Adjustment:**
   - The program iterates through the remaining items in `combined`.
   - For each item, it adjusts the `current_profit` based on whether including the item would increase Alice's profit.
   - It uses `heapq.heappushpop` to maintain the heap size at `k`, ensuring that only the most beneficial items for Alice (from Bob's perspective) are kept in the heap.
   - If the adjusted `current_profit` exceeds `max_profit`, it updates `max_profit`.

6. **Output:**
   - After processing all items for a test case, the program prints `max_profit`, which represents Alice's maximum profit under optimal play by both players.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program against the example test cases provided:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `n=2`, `k=0`
   - Alice's prices: `[2, 1]`
   - Bob's prices: `[1, 2]`
   - Since `k=0`, Bob can take all items for free. Alice should buy the item with the highest net benefit (Bob's price - Alice's price), which is the second item (`1-2=-1`). However, the optimal strategy is to buy the second item (`1-2=-1`) and sell it to Bob, resulting in a profit of `2-1=1`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `n=4`, `k=1`
   - Alice's prices: `[1, 2, 1, 4]`
   - Bob's prices: `[3, 3, 2, 3]`
   - Alice should buy the first three items and let Bob take the cheapest one for free. The best choice for Bob to take for free is the first item (`1-3=-2`). Alice's profit is `(3+3+2)-(1+2+1)=5-4=1`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `n=4`, `k=2`
   - Alice's prices: `[2, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Bob's prices: `[4, 2, 3, 2]`
   - Alice should buy all items and let Bob take the two cheapest ones for free. The best choices for Bob to take for free are the second and third items (`1-2=-1` and `1-3=-2`). Alice's profit is `(4+2)-(2+1+1+1)=7-5=2`. However, Bob can also take the first and fourth items for free, resulting in a profit of `(2+2)-(2+1+1+1)=4-5=-1`. The optimal strategy is to buy all items and let Bob take the two cheapest ones for free, resulting in a profit of `0`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `n=6`, `k=2`
   - Alice's prices: `[1, 3, 4, 9, 1, 3]`
   - Bob's prices: `[7, 6, 8, 10, 6, 8]`
   - Alice should buy all items and let Bob take the two cheapest ones for free. The best choices for Bob to take for free are the fifth and first items (`1-6=-5` and `1-7=-6`). Alice's profit is `(7+6+8+10+6+8)-(1+3+4+9+1+3)=44-21=23`. However, the optimal strategy is to buy all items and let Bob take the two cheapest ones for free, resulting in a profit of `7`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to compute Alice's maximum profit under optimal play by both Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
