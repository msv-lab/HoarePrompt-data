The code snippet creates a new list `neg_prices` by negating each element in the `prices` list. This means that if `prices` contained `[p1, p2, ..., pn]`, `neg_prices` will now contain `[-p1, -p2, ..., -pn]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`combined` is empty, `heap` is an empty list, `current_profit` reflects the final profit, `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`, `bonuses` is unchanged, `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
