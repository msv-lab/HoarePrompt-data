Output State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k) - 1` elements remaining; `item` is the last element removed from `combined` and satisfies either `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `item[0] + item[1] < 0`; `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined` with `item` pushed and the smallest element popped; `removed_item` is the smallest element from the heap before `item` was pushed and is not None; `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or adding `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and then further adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`; `max_profit` is updated if the adjusted `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.**

In simpler terms, the `current_profit` has been further adjusted by subtracting the first element of `removed_item`. All other variables remain unchanged.
