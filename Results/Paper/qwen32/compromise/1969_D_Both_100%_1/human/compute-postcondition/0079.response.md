Postcondition: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple. If `combined` is non-empty, `heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list, while `current_profit`, `max_profit`, and `remaining_items` remain unchanged at 0, an empty list, respectively. If `combined` is empty, `heap` remains an empty list. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is greater than 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`.**
