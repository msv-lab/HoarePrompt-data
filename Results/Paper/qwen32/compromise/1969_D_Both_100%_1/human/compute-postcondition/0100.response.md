The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` pushes `item` onto the heap and then pops the smallest element from the heap, assigning it to `removed_item`.

Given the initial state, the heap will now contain `item` and the smallest element (previously in the heap) will be removed and stored in `removed_item`. This means `heap` will still contain the last `k` elements that were originally in `combined`, but with `item` replacing the smallest element.

Since `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added, the state of `heap` changes to include `item` and exclude the smallest element that was previously in the heap.

The other variables (`combined`, `item`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`combined` contains at least one fewer element than it did initially, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `heap` will contain the last `k` elements that were originally in `combined` with `item` replacing the smallest element, `current_profit` will be the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`, `max_profit` will be equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `remaining_items` will be an empty list, `n` will be the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` will be the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` will be the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` will be a list of negative prices, `bonuses` will be the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` will have been decremented by 1, `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added.**
