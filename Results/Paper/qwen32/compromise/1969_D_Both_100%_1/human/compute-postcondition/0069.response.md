The code snippet `prices = list(func_2())` updates the `prices` variable by assigning it the list returned by the function `func_2()`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`combined` is an empty list; `heap` is an empty list; `current_profit` is the final adjusted profit; `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`.**

In natural language: The `prices` variable is now updated to hold the list returned by `func_2()`. All other variables retain their previous values.
