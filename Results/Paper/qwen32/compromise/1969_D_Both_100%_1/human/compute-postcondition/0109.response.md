Output State: **`combined` contains at least one element (after removing the last element), `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `heap` will contain the last `k` elements that were originally in `combined` with `item` replacing the smallest element if `removed_item` is truthy, `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added, `current_profit` will be the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]` minus `removed_item[0]` if `removed_item` is truthy; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`. However, `current_profit` has been decreased by `item[1]`. `remaining_items` will be an empty list, `n` will be the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` will be the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` will be the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` will be a list of negative prices, `bonuses` will be the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` will have been decremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, `current_profit` has been reduced by the value of `item[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
