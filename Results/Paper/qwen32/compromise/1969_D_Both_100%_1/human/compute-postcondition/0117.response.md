To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop. The loop continues as long as `combined` is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `combined` contains at least one element (after removing the last element).
- `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`.
- `heap` contains the last `k` elements that were originally in `combined` with `item` replacing the smallest element if `removed_item` is truthy.
- `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added.
- `remaining_items` will be an empty list.
- `n` will be the first value returned by `func_2()`.
- `k` will be the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `prices` will be the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` will be a list of negative prices.
- `bonuses` will be the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `test_cases` will have been decremented by 1.
- If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.

Since the loop condition is `while combined:`, the loop will continue as long as `combined` is not empty. After the last iteration, `combined` contains at least one element (after removing the last element). To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `combined` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed because the problem states that `combined` already contains at least one element after the last removal. This means the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`combined` contains at least one element (after removing the last element); `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`; `heap` contains the last `k` elements that were originally in `combined` with `item` replacing the smallest element if `removed_item` is truthy; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added; `remaining_items` will be an empty list; `n` will be the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` will be the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` will be the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` will be a list of negative prices; `bonuses` will be the list returned by `func_2()`; and `test_cases` will have been decremented by 1. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
