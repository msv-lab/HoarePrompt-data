The code snippet provided involves pushing the last element of the `combined` list onto the `heap` using `heapq.heappush()` and then removing that last element from the `combined` list using `pop()`. 

Given the initial state:
- `combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.
- `heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list if `combined` is non-empty.
- `current_profit`, `max_profit`, and `remaining_items` are 0, an empty list, respectively.
- `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` are set based on the output of `func_2()`.
- `test_cases` is decremented by 1.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `combined` is removed and pushed onto `heap`.
- `combined` now has one less element compared to its initial state.
- `heap` now includes the element that was previously the last element of `combined`.

Since the exact elements of `combined` are not specified, we cannot determine the specific values of the elements being moved. However, we can describe the state changes accurately.

Output State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple, with the last element removed; `heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list plus the newly pushed element; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is an empty list; `remaining_items` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is greater than 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`.**
