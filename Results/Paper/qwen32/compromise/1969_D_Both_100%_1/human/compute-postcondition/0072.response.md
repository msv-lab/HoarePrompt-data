Output State: **`combined` is an empty list; `heap` is an empty list; `current_profit` is the final adjusted profit; `max_profit` is 0; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `max_profit` is set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
