Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer), `k` is `new_k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `new_k` <= `new_n`), `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element (bonus) in ascending order, `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` is a list containing one more element (the last element of the previous `combined` list) if `combined` was non-empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element (bonus) in ascending order with one less element than before if `combined` was non-empty; `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `heap` includes `popped_tuple` from `combined` if `combined` was non-empty; `combined` has one less element than before if it was non-empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `heap` includes `popped_tuple` from `combined` if `combined` was non-empty; `combined` has one less element than before if it was non-empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1. If `combined` was non-empty, the last element of `combined` is popped and added to `heap`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
