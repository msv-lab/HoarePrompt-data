To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_2()` does. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the given context, we'll assume that it returns two values which will be assigned to `n` and `k`. Given the nature of the problem, let's assume `func_2()` returns a new `n` and `k` that satisfy the conditions `n` being a positive integer and `k` being a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k <= n`.

Let's denote the values returned by `func_2()` as `new_n` and `new_k`. After the assignment, `n` will take the value of `new_n` and `k` will take the value of `new_k`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer), `k` is `new_k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `new_k` <= `new_n`), `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices for Alice, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses for Bob, `max_profit` is an integer initialized to 0 representing the maximum profit found, `current_profit` is an integer initialized to 0 representing the current profit, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and the list is sorted by the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
