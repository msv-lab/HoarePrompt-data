The code sorts the `combined` list based on the second element of each tuple (which corresponds to the elements in the `bonuses` list). This sorting operation does not affect the values of `heap`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, or `bonuses`. It only changes the order of the tuples within the `combined` list.

Output State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple; `heap` is an empty list; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
