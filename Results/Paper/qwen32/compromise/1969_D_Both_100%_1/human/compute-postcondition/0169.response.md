Output State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k) - 1` elements remaining; `item` is the last element removed from `combined` and satisfies either `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `item[0] + item[1] < 0`; `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined` with `item` pushed and the smallest element popped; if `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or adding `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and then further adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
