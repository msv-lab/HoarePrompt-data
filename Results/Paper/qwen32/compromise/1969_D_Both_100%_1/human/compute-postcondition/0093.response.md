To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head. The `while` loop condition is `while combined:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `combined` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `combined` will either be empty or contain `len(combined) - k` elements left.
- `heap` will contain the last `k` elements that were originally in `combined`.
- `current_profit` will be the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty; otherwise, it remains 0.
- `max_profit` will be equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `remaining_items` will be an empty list.
- `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` are all initialized based on the return values of `func_2()`.
- `test_cases` has been decremented by 1.

For the loop to execute the first time, `combined` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `combined` contains at least one element.

Here is the modified state:

State: **`combined` must contain at least one element, `heap` will contain the last `k` elements that were originally in `combined`, `current_profit` will be the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty; otherwise, it remains 0, `max_profit` will be equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `remaining_items` will be an empty list, `n` will be the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` will be the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` will be the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` will be a list of negative prices, `bonuses` will be the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` will have been decremented by 1**.
