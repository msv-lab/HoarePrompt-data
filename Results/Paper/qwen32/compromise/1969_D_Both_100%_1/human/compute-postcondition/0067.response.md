The code snippet provided does not actually change the value of `remaining_items` since it is already initialized as an empty list. Therefore, no changes occur to the state of the variables.

Output State: **`combined` is an empty list; `heap` is an empty list; `current_profit` is the final adjusted profit; `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n`; `k` is a positive integer; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`.**
