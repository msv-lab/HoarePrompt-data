Postcondition: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k)` elements remaining. If `combined` is non-empty, `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined`, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `max_profit` is 0. If `combined` is empty, `current_profit` remains 0. `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
