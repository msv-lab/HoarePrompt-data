Output State: **`combined` contains at least one element (after removing the last element); `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`; `heap` contains the last `k` elements that were originally in `combined` with `item` replacing the smallest element if `removed_item` is truthy; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added; `remaining_items` will be an empty list; `n` will be the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` will be the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` will be the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` will be a list of negative prices; `bonuses` will be the list returned by `func_2()`; and `test_cases` will have been decremented by 1. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `item = combined.pop()` removes the last element from the list `combined` and assigns it to the variable `item`. This means `combined` now has one less element than it did before. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
