Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem states that we have `n` containers, each containing `a_i` units of water. The sum of all `a_i` is divisible by `n`. We need to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the operation of pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Equal Distribution**: Since the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, there exists a target amount of water `mean = total / n` that each container should have.
2. **Operation Constraints**: Water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index, i.e., `i < j`.

### Solution Strategy:
To determine if it's possible to achieve the equal distribution, we can use the following approach:
- Calculate the target amount of water `mean` that each container should have.
- Traverse the containers from left to right, keeping a running total of the difference between the current water level and the target `mean`.
- If at any point the running total becomes negative, it means we've encountered a situation where we need to pour water from a container that is supposed to have less water than the target to a container that is supposed to have more water. Since we can only pour water from left to right, this situation is impossible to resolve, and we should return "NO".
- If we can traverse all containers without the running total becoming negative, it means we can achieve the equal distribution by pouring water from left to right, and we should return "YES".

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows the above strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
3. It defines a function `func_1` that:
   - Calculates the target amount of water `mean`.
   - Initializes a running total `curr` to 0.
   - Iterates through the list of water amounts, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current water amount and `mean`.
   - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it returns "NO".
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns "YES".

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers representing the amounts of water in the containers. It checks if it is possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount, given that the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If the redistribution condition is met, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the given operation constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `1`, `43`
   - `mean = 43 / 1 = 43`
   - `curr = 43 - 43 = 0`
   - Output: "YES"

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `2`, `1 3`
   - `mean = 4 / 2 = 2`
   - `curr = 1 - 2 = -1` (negative, so return "NO")
   - Output: "NO"

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `5`, `4 5 2 1 3`
   - `mean = 15 / 5 = 3`
   - `curr = 4 - 3 = 1`, `1 + (5 - 3) = 3`, `3 + (2 - 3) = 2`, `2 + (1 - 3) = 0`, `0 + (3 - 3) = 0`
   - Output: "YES"

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `3`, `1 2 3`
   - `mean = 6 / 3 = 2`
   - `curr = 1 - 2 = -1` (negative, so return "NO")
   - Output: "NO"

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `7`, `4 5 5 0 6 4 4`
   - `mean = 28 / 7 = 4`
   - `curr = 4 - 4 = 0`, `0 + (5 - 4) = 1`, `1 + (5 - 4) = 2`, `2 + (0 - 4) = -2` (negative, so return "NO")
   - Output: "NO"

6. **Test Case 6**:
   - Input: `7`, `6 5 5 1 3 4 4`
   - `mean = 28 / 7 = 4`
   - `curr = 6 - 4 = 2`, `2 + (5 - 4) = 3`, `3 + (5 - 4) = 4`, `4 + (1 - 4) = 1`, `1 + (3 - 4) = 0`, `0 + (4 - 4) = 0`, `0 + (4 - 4) = 0`
   - Output: "YES"

The program produces the correct output for all test cases, which supports the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
