### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. The approach taken in the program is to check if the cumulative deviation from the mean (average) of the water amounts in the containers ever goes negative during the iteration over the containers.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of containers and the amounts of water in each container.
2. **Sum and Mean Calculation:** For each test case, the program calculates the total amount of water and the mean amount of water per container.
3. **Deviation Check:** The program iterates over the containers and keeps a running total (`curr`) of the deviation from the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the current distribution of water cannot be balanced out by pouring water from earlier containers to later ones, and the program returns 'NO'.
4. **Final Check:** If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, the program returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to balance the water amounts.

### Issues in the Annotated Program:

- **Incorrect State Description:** The annotation states that `nums` is a list of lists, which is incorrect. `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in the containers for a single test case.
- **Incorrect Loop Condition:** The loop should iterate over the containers, not the test cases. The loop should run `n` times, where `n` is the number of containers in the current test case.
- **Mean Calculation:** The mean calculation is correct, but the loop should iterate over the containers correctly.
- **Logic for Balance Check:** The logic for checking if the water can be balanced is correct. If the cumulative deviation (`curr`) never goes negative, then it is possible to balance the water.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))
```

### Conclusion:

The logic of the program is correct, but there is an issue in the description of the state of `nums` and the loop condition. The corrected program will work as intended.

**Correctness: True**
