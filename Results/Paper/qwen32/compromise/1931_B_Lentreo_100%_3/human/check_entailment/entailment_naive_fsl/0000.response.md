Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The code checks if the cumulative difference between the current container's water level and the mean is ever negative, which is not a correct way to determine if we can equalize the water levels using the allowed operations.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the code is incorrect and a counterexample:

### Flawed Logic:
The function `func_1` iterates through the list of water levels (`nums`), calculating the cumulative difference between the current water level and the mean water level (`mean`). If this cumulative difference becomes negative at any point, the function incorrectly returns 'NO'. However, this check does not accurately reflect the possibility of redistributing water using the allowed operations (pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`).

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
For this input, the mean water level is `(1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2`. The cumulative differences are:
- After the first container (1): `1 - 2 = -1` (cumulative difference = -1)
- After the second container (2): `-1 + (2 - 2) = -1` (cumulative difference = -1)
- After the third container (3): `-1 + (3 - 2) = 0` (cumulative difference = 0)

The function would return 'NO' because the cumulative difference was negative at one point. However, it is possible to equalize the water levels by pouring 1 unit of water from the third container to the first container, resulting in `[2, 2, 2]`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels, we need to ensure that at no point do we need to pour water from a container with less water to a container with more water, which is not allowed by the problem constraints. The correct approach involves checking if the prefix sums of the differences (water level - mean) are non-negative.

### Corrected Code (for reference):
```python
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))
```

However, the original code already follows this logic, but the explanation above clarifies why this logic is correct. The original code seems to be correct based on the problem description and the logic it follows.

Since the code does not have any obvious issues and follows the correct logic, the original code is indeed correct.

### Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly checks if the cumulative difference between the current water level and the mean water level is non-negative at all points, which is a valid approach to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels using the allowed operations. The code handles all edge cases and works as expected for the given problem description.
