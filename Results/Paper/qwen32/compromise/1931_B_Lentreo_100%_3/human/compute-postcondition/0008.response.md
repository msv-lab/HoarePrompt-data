To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the provided code and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `nums` is a list of lists, with each sublist representing a test case.
   - Each sublist contains `n+1` integers: the first integer `n` is the number of containers, and the next `n` integers are the amounts of water in the containers.
   - The sum of the water amounts for each test case is divisible by `n`.
   - `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums` across all test cases, and `total` is divisible by the number of test cases `n`.
   - `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`.
   - `curr` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each test case in `nums`.
   - For each test case, it calculates the difference between the sum of the water amounts in the containers and `mean`.
   - It adds this difference to `curr`.
   - If `curr` becomes less than 0 at any point, the function returns 'NO'.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since the sum of water amounts for each test case is divisible by `n`, the mean for each test case is an integer and represents the equal distribution of water among the containers.
   - The loop essentially checks if it is possible to redistribute the water such that no intermediate step results in a negative `curr` value. If at any point `curr` goes negative, it means that redistributing the water in the current sequence of test cases is not possible without going into a negative state, and the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it means that the water can be redistributed without any intermediate negative state.

Given the conditions and the loop behavior, the output state would either be 'NO' if `curr` goes negative at any point, or the final value of `curr` after the loop completes. However, since the problem specifies the output state in terms of the variables and not a return value, we focus on the final state of `curr`.

**Output State:**
Since the problem does not specify that the function returns early, and assuming the loop completes without returning 'NO', the final value of `curr` would be 0 (as the sum of all deviations from the mean across all test cases should balance out to zero).

Output State: **curr is 0.**
