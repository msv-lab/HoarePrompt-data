You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the number of test cases. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `total` is divisible by `n`.
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Since the problem does not specify that the function returns early, and assuming the loop completes without returning 'NO', the final value of `curr` would be 0 (as the sum of all deviations from the mean across all test cases should balance out to zero).
    #
    #Output State:
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of lists. Each sublist represents a test case and contains `n+1` integers. The first integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of `a_i` for each test case is divisible by `n`. The function returns 'NO' if a certain condition is not met (details of the condition are not provided in the constraints), and 'YES' if the condition is met.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
