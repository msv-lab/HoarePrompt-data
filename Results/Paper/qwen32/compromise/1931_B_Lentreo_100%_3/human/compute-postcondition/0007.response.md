The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `nums`, `total`, `mean`, and `curr` does not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so we don't need to adjust those.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop counter and does not need to be set before the loop starts since it will be initialized by the `range(n)` function.

State: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the number of test cases, `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`. `curr` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
