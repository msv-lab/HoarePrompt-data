Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the value of `possible` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
