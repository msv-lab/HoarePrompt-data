Postcondition: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `i` is `i + 1`. If `c[i] != a[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged and the loop or if statement continues.**
