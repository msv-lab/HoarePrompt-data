Postcondition: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. If the character at position `i` in `c` is not equal to the character at position `i` in `a`, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`. At the current index `i`, the character at position `i` in `a` is equal to the character at position `i` in `b`.**
