The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given that no changes are made to the variables in the provided code snippet, the values of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial state with no modifications.

Output State: **`possible` is `False`, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, `i` is now 0, the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`**.
