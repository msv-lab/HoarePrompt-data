The given initial state indicates that the variable `possible` is `True`. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet does not use or reference the variable `possible`. Instead, it directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the value of `possible`, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
