The code snippet provided is:
```
t = int(input())
```

This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). After executing this line, `t` will be updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
