Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    possible = False
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if c[i] != a[i]:
                possible = True
                break
        elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
            continue
        else:
            possible = True
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `possible` is a boolean. If any of the conditions for setting `possible` to `True` were met during the iterations, `possible` is `True`. Otherwise, `possible` is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `possible` is a boolean indicating whether any iteration met the condition where `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or if `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, and `t` is greater than the new value of `_`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `possible` is a boolean value. If `possible` is True, it indicates that at least one iteration met the breaking conditions. If `possible` is False, it indicates that no iteration met the breaking conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
