Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `possible` is `False`, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `possible` is `True` if `c[0]` is not equal to `a[0]` and `a[0]` equals `b[0]`. If `a[0]` does not equal `b[0]`, `possible` is `False` if `c[0]` is equal to either `a[0]` or `b[0]`. Otherwise, `possible` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. In all cases, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, and `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, `possible` is `False` if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input strings, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `_` is incremented and the loop is broken out of. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and `c[i]` equals `a[i]`, the state remains unchanged except for not breaking out of the loop. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `_` is incremented and the loop is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `_` is incremented by 1 and the loop is broken out of. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is `False` and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible` is `True`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop is broken out of. `_` is incremented by 1 if the loop is broken out of, and `t` is greater than the new value of `_`. `n` is greater than 2, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input strings with `i` being 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
