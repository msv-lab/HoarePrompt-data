The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since the provided code snippet only contains `continue`, it does not alter the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `b`. The current value of `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`.**
