To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, the loop checks if the string `c` can be formed based on the conditions involving strings `a` and `b`. Specifically, it checks:
1. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, then `possible` is set to `True`.
2. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `possible` is set to `True`.
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, `possible` remains `False`.

The output state after the loop executes all `t` times is determined by whether any of the iterations set `possible` to `True`. If any iteration sets `possible` to `True`, the final output state will be `YES`. If none of the iterations set `possible` to `True`, the final output state will be `NO`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After the first iteration, `possible` could be either `True` or `False`.
- After the second iteration, `possible` could still be `True` if any of the conditions were met in either of the first two iterations.
- After the third iteration, `possible` could be `True` if any of the conditions were met in any of the first three iterations.

Since the loop runs `t` times, the final output state will be `YES` if any of the `t` iterations set `possible` to `True`. If none of the `t` iterations set `possible` to `True`, the final output state will be `NO`.

Therefore, the final output state is determined by whether any of the `t` iterations met the conditions that set `possible` to `True`.

Output State: **YES if any iteration sets `possible` to `True`, otherwise NO.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is `YES` if any of the test cases meet the specified conditions, otherwise it is `NO`.
