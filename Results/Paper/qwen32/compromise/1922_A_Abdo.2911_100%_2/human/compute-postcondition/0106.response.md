Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `b`, and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `possible` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
