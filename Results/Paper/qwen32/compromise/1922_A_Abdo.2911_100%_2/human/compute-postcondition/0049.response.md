The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `c` by taking an input and stripping it. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`possible` is a boolean, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string.**

In natural language: The variable `c` now holds the value of the stripped input string. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
