The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is contained within. The variables `n`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, `c[i]`, and `possible` are not affected by this statement directly.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the program will exit the loop or block where this `break` statement is placed. The values of `n`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, `c[i]`, and `possible` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, and the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`; `possible` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
