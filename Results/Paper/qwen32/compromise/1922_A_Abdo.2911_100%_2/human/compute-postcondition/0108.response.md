Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `possible` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `possible` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
