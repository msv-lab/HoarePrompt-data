Postcondition: **`possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, `possible` is `False` if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input strings, and `i` is 2. If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration; otherwise, the loop is broken out of.**
