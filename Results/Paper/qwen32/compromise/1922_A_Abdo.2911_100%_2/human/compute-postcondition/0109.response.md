The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Since the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement based on the conditions provided, `i` should be incremented to the next value in the range for the next iteration to potentially execute.

Given that `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`** (where `i` is the value from the previous iteration incremented by 1)
