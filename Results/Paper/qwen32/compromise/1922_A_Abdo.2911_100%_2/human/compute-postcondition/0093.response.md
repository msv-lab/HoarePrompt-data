The code snippet assigns the value of `input().strip()` to the variable `c`. This means `c` will hold the stripped version of the new input value. The other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input value, `b` is the stripped input value, `c` is the stripped input value**.
