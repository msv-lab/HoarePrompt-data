### Reasoning:

The program's logic is intended to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The logic is as follows:

1. For each test case, the program reads the length `n` of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. It then iterates over each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
3. For each position `i`:
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`, since they are the same) for the template to be valid. If this condition holds, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the template to be valid. If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the loop continues to the next character. If `c[i]` is different from both, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.
4. If after checking all positions `possible` is still `False`, it means no valid template exists, and "NO" is printed. Otherwise, "YES" is printed.

The provided logic correctly implements the requirement to find a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.
