You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        possible = False
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It then checks if there exists at least one position `i` in the strings such that `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, or if `c[i]` is not equal to both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that:
  - Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
  - String `c` does not match the template `t`.
- A template can have lowercase or uppercase letters.
- If the template's character is lowercase, the corresponding character in the string must match.
- If the template's character is uppercase, the corresponding character in the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's character.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over each test case and for each test case, it checks each character position `i` of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`:
1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` for the template to be valid.
2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `c[i]` must not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]` for the template to be valid.

The program sets `possible` to `True` if it finds a position where the conditions are met and breaks out of the loop. If such a position is found, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify the logic:
- **Case 1:** If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` to ensure `c` does not match the template, while `a` and `b` do.
- **Case 2:** If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` to ensure `c` does not match the template, while `a` and `b` can match the template with a template character that is uppercase.

The program correctly handles these cases and breaks as soon as it finds a valid position, which is sufficient to determine the existence of such a template.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid template exists based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
