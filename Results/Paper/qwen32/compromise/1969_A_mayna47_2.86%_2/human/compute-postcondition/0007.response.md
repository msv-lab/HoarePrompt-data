To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the loop and its conditions:

The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each `i`, it checks if `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`. If this condition is met for any `i`, it prints `2` and exits the function immediately.

Given the constraints:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`], and all `p_i` are distinct.
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining `n` elements are the integers from `p`.

The list `v` is essentially a permutation of the list `p` with an extra 0 at the beginning. Each `p_i` is a distinct integer from 1 to `n` and `p_i` is not equal to `i`.

Since `p_i` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` with no fixed points (i.e., `p_i` != `i`), the nested indexing `v[v[v[i]]]` will not result in `i` for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`. This is because the permutation ensures that no element points back to itself in a single or double application of the permutation.

Therefore, the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` will never be true for any `i` in the loop, and the loop will complete all iterations without printing `2` or exiting early.

Output State: **the loop completes all iterations without printing anything, and the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged.**
