Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine exactly what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
2. `n` is the input integer and its current value is 2.
3. `p` is a list of 2 integers where each \(p_i\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq p_i \leq 2\), \(p_i \neq i\) for all \(i\) in \([1, 2]\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct.
4. `v` is a list of 3 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining 2 elements are the integers read from the input.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(2)` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables defined in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `p`, or `v`). It simply prints the integer `2`.

### Output:
Output: **2**
