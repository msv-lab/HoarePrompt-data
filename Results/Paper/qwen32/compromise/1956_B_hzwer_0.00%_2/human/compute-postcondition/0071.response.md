The code snippet `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. Given that `j` is `0`, this means `dp[i][0]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][0]`.

The initial state specifies the conditions for `dp[0][j]`, but since the code modifies `dp[i][j]` and not `dp[0][j]` directly, those conditions remain unchanged for `dp[0][j]`. The only change is that `dp[i][0]` now holds the value of `dp[i + 1][0]`.

Output State: **`dp[0][j]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from position `j` in the `cards` list. If the `cards` list does not contain `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the `cards` list contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is the maximum value between `dp[1][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1] + 1`. If the `cards` list contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `n` is at least 1, and `j` is `0`. `dp[i][0]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][0]`.**
