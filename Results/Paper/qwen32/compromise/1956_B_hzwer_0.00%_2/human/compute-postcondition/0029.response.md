The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 3` down to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means that `i` is decreased by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the next value that is still within the loop's range. However, since the loop decrements `i` and the current value of `i` is `0`, the loop will not execute again because the next value of `i` would be `-1`, which is outside the range.

Since the loop will not execute again, there is no need to adjust the state of `i` further. The state remains as it is at the end of the last iteration.

State: **The final `dp` table after all iterations, where `dp[0][0]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected. All other elements of `dp` are updated based on the logic described in the loop. `i` is 0**
