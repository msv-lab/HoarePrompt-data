The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum value among three possible expressions. The specific values of `i` and `j` are not provided, but we can describe the general state after the update.

The value of `dp[i][j]` is now the maximum of:
- `dp[i + 1][j]`
- `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`
- `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`

All other preconditions remain the same:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `cards` is a list of integers read from input.
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 2][0]` is 0.
- `cards` contains at least one occurrence of `j + 1`.
- The count of `j + 1` in `cards` is more than 1.

Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`; all other preconditions remain the same.**
