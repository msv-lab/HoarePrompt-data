In the given task, the for loop iterates over the variable `j` in the range from `n - 1` down to `0`. The loop head only involves the variable `j` and the constant `n`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `n` is at least 1, which would make the range non-empty and allow the loop to run from `n - 1` down to `0`.

The state of the `dp` table and the variable `i` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`dp` table with `dp[0][0]` holding the maximum number of cards that can be collected, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
