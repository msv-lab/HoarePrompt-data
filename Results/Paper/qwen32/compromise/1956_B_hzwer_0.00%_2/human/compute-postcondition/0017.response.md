The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. This means that the element at position `[i][j]` in the 2D list `dp` is updated to the value of the element at position `[i + 1][j]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be at least 2
- `cards` is a list of integers read from input
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`
- `j` is `j - 1`

The value of `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`, `j` is `j - 1`**.
