The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the loop statement, `j` starts at `n - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, and it was decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be the next value in the sequence, which is `j + 1` (since it will be decremented at the start of the next iteration).

Given that the loop runs from `n - 1` down to `0`, the state of `j` at the start of the next iteration should be `j + 1`, provided that `j + 1` is still within the loop bounds (i.e., `j + 1 >= 0`).

Since we are not given the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can infer that if the loop is about to execute again, `j` must have been `0` at the end of the previous iteration (because the next value, `j + 1`, would be `1`, which is out of bounds for the loop).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `0` at the start of the next iteration, and since it will be decremented, the loop will terminate after that iteration.

However, if we are to strictly adhere to the task of adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time, we should set `j` to the next valid value in the sequence, which is `1` (if the previous `j` was `0`).

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is 1**
