Output State: **`dp[0][j]` holds the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`; `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`, and the `cards` list contains at least one occurrence of `j + 1`. The `cards` list contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `dp[0][j]` is updated to be the maximum of three values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
