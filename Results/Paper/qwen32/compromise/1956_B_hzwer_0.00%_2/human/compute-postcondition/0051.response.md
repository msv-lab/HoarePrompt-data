Postcondition: **`dp[0][0]` is the value of `dp[1][0]` if the count of `1` in the `cards` list is 0, otherwise it is `max(dp[1][0], dp[2][-1] + 1)` if the count of `1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, or `max(dp[1][0], 1, dp[1][1])` if the count of `1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1. `dp[0][1]` is equal to `dp[1][1]` if the count of `2` in the `cards` list is 0, `max(dp[1][1], dp[2][0] + 1)` if the count of `2` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, or `max(dp[1][1], dp[2][0] + 1, dp[1][2])` if the count of `2` in the `cards` list is greater than 1. For `j > 1`, `dp[0][j]` holds the value of `dp[1][j]` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, otherwise it holds the maximum value between `dp[1][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1] + 1` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, or the maximum value between `dp[1][j]`, `dp[2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[1][j + 1]` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1. `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0.**
