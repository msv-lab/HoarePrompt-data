Precondition: **The function `func_1()` is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of cards you and Nene each receive. The second line of each test case contains a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list at most 2 times. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
