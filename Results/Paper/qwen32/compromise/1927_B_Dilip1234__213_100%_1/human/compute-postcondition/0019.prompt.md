Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 integers, all initialized to 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(26):
    if char_count[j] == a[i]:
        s += chr(j + ord('a'))
        char_count[j] += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is a string, and `char_count` is a list of 26 integers. If `char_count[j]` was equal to `a[i]`, then `s` contains the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` and `char_count[j]` is now equal to `a[i] + 1`. Otherwise, `s` and `char_count` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is a string, and `char_count` is a list of 26 integers. If `char_count[j]` was equal to `a[i]`, then `s` includes an additional character `chr(j + ord('a'))` and `char_count[j]` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `s` and `char_count` remain unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1 if the condition is not met, and by 2 if the condition is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is a string, and `char_count` is a list of 26 integers. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` has an additional character `chr(j + ord('a'))` appended, `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, there is no change to `s` or `char_count[j]`. `j` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
