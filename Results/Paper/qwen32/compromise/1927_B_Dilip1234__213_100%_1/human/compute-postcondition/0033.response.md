The code snippet `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends a character to the string `s`. Given that `j` is 2, `chr(j + ord('a'))` evaluates to `chr(2 + ord('a'))`, which is `chr(99)`, or the character `'c'`.

Therefore, the string `s` will have `'c'` appended to it. The values of `i`, `n`, and `char_count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` contains a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`, followed by `'c'`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, `s` contains two characters `chr(j + ord('a'))` followed by `'b'`, followed by `'c'`. `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 1 if a match was not found, and incremented by 2 if a match was found, at index `j`. `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, and `j` is 2.**
