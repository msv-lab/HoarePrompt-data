Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is a string, and `char_count` is a list of 26 integers. If `char_count[j]` was equal to `a[i]`, then `s` includes an additional character `chr(j + ord('a'))` and `char_count[j]` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `s` and `char_count` remain unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1 if the condition is not met, and by 2 if the condition is met.**
