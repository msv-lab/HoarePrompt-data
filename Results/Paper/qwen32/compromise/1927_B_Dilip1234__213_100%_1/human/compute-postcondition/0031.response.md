Postcondition: **`s` contains a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, `s` contains two characters `chr(j + ord('a'))` followed by `'b'`. `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 1 if a match was not found, and incremented by 2 if a match was found, at index `j`. `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, and `j` is 1. If a match was found (`char_count[j] == a[i]`), `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
