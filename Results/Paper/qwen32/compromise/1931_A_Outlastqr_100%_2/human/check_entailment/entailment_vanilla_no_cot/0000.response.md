Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n` within the given range (3 to 78). Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Cases**: The logic in the program does not correctly handle all cases, especially for smaller values of `n` and values between 28 and 52.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle the edge cases and transitions between different ranges of `n`.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic for calculating the word does not guarantee the smallest lexicographical order for all inputs.

Let's break down the correct approach to solve the problem:

- For a given `n`, we need to find three letters `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `a + b + c = n` and the string `abc` is lexicographically smallest.
- Start with the smallest possible letter `a` and increment it while ensuring that `b` and `c` are also valid letters and `a + b + c = n`.
- The values of `b` and `c` should be maximized to ensure the smallest possible `a`.

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def func():
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        # Start with the smallest possible 'a'
        for a in range(1, 27):
            for b in range(1, 27):
                c = n - a - b
                if 1 <= c <= 26:
                    word = alphabet[a-1] + alphabet[b-1] + alphabet[c-1]
                    break
            if word:
                break
        print(word)

func()
```

This program correctly finds the lexicographically smallest word for each given `n` by iterating over possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` and ensuring they sum to `n`.
