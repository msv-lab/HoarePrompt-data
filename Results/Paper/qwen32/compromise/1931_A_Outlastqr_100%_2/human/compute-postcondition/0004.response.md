Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 78) and prints a specific word based on the value of `n`. The printed word is constructed using the lowercase English alphabet and follows specific rules depending on the value of `n`.**
