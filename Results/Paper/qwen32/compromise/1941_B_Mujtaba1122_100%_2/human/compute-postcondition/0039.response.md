The list is `[0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3. The code modifies the list at index `i` by subtracting twice the value at index `i-1` from it.

Given `i` is 2, the value at `list[i]` is 2 and the value at `list[i-1]` is 1. The operation `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]` translates to `list[2] -= 2 * list[1]`, which is `2 -= 2 * 1` or `2 -= 2`, resulting in `0`.

Therefore, the list becomes `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`.

Output State: **The list is `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3.**
