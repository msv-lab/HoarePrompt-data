The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or objects from the initial state. The string 'YES' is explicitly provided within the `print` function.

Given the initial state, we know:
- A list is initialized with all elements as 0.
- A function `func_1` returns `True` for this list and the value `n`.

However, these details do not affect the `print` statement in any way because the string 'YES' is hardcoded and does not reference any variables or the result of `func_1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will simply be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
