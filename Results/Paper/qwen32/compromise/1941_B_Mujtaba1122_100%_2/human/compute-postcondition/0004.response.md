The code snippet `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` effectively sets the value of `list[i - 1]` to 0, since subtracting one times its value from itself results in zero.

Given the initial state, the value at `list[i - 1]` will be updated to 0, while the rest of the list remains unchanged. The value of `n` is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated list will have 0 at the position `i - 1`.

Output State: **`list` is `[1, 2, 0, ...]` (where the rest of the list can be any non-negative integers except the element at index `i + 1` which is updated as described), `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3` and `n` equals the length of the list.**
