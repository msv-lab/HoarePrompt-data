You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (where `n` is at least 3) by modifying its elements based on specific conditions. If during this process any element at position `i-1` is not zero after a certain operation, it prints 'no' and terminates. Otherwise, it calls another function `func_1` with the modified list and `n`. Depending on the return value of `func_1`, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the logic of the given program and compare it to the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array zero using a specific operation.
- The operation can be performed any number of times and on any index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`).
- The operation modifies the array elements at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` as follows:
  - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
  - `a_i = a_i - 2`
  - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`

### Analysis of the Program:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(list, n)`: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
2. `func_2(list, n)`: This function attempts to apply the operation to make all elements zero.

#### `func_2(list, n)`:
- It iterates through the array from index `1` to `n-2` (since `i` must be between `2` and `n-1`).
- For each `i`, it enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
- Inside the loop, it performs the operation described in the problem.
- However, the operation inside the loop is incorrect:
  - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
- The correct operation should be:
  - `list[i + 1] -= 1`
  - `list[i] -= 2`
  - `list[i - 1] -= 1`
- After the loop, it checks if `list[i-1]` is not zero and prints 'no' if it is not.
- Finally, it checks if all elements are zero using `func_1` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Operation**: The operation inside the `while` loop is incorrect. It should decrement each element by the fixed values (1, 2, 1) instead of multiplying by `list[i - 1]`.
2. **Logic Error**: The check `if list[i - 1] != 0` is misplaced and incorrect. It should not be used to determine the possibility of making the array zero.
3. **Output Handling**: The program prints 'no' and returns immediately if `list[i-1]` is not zero, which is not the correct approach to determine the possibility of making the entire array zero.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made zero using the described operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
