### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions in the context of the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.
   - This function is used to verify if the array has been successfully transformed into all zeros after the operations.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operation.
   - The loop iterates from the second element to the second-to-last element (i.e., indices 1 to n-2). For each element at index `i`, it checks if the current element and its neighbors (at `i-1` and `i+1`) can be reduced by the operation.
   - The operation is applied as long as the current element (`list[i]`) is greater than 1 and both neighbors (`list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]`) are greater than 0.
   - The operation modifies the elements as follows:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - After attempting the operation, if the element at `i-1` is not zero, it prints 'no' and returns, indicating that it's not possible to make all elements zero.
   - If the loop completes without hitting the return condition, it calls `func_1` to check if the entire list is zero. If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues with the Code:

- **Incorrect Operation Logic**:
  - The operation logic in `func_2` is incorrect. The operation is supposed to reduce each of the three elements by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. However, the current implementation multiplies the reduction by the value of `list[i - 1]`, which is not the intended behavior.
  - For example, if `list[i-1]` is 2, the operation would reduce `list[i+1]` by 2, `list[i]` by 4, and `list[i-1]` by 2, which is not what the problem specifies.

- **Early Termination**:
  - The function `func_2` terminates early if any element at `i-1` is not zero after attempting the operation. This might be correct if the operation is supposed to reduce `list[i-1]` to zero, but given the incorrect operation logic, this might not be the intended behavior.

### Correctness:

Given the issues with the operation logic in `func_2`, the program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
