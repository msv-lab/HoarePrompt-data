Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**: The operation described in the problem involves subtracting 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`. However, the given code incorrectly subtracts `list[i - 1]` times these values, which is not what the operation specifies.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop in `func_2` attempts to apply the operation repeatedly as long as `list[i] > 1` and the neighboring elements are positive. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the operation and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Early Termination**: The code incorrectly prints 'no' and returns if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the inner while loop. This is not a correct way to determine if the operation can be applied.

4. **Final Check**: The final check using `func_1` to see if all elements are zero is correct, but the incorrect operations applied before this check mean that the result will not be accurate.

Here is a corrected version of the logic that should work:

1. **Observation**: For the operation to be valid, the parity (odd/even nature) of the elements must follow a specific pattern. Specifically, the first and last elements must have the same parity, and all other elements must have the same parity as each other but different from the first and last elements.

2. **Implementation**: Check the parity of the first and last elements and then check the parity of the rest of the elements to ensure they match the required pattern.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def is_possible_to_make_zero(arr, n):
    if n < 3:
        return "NO"
    
    first_parity = arr[0] % 2
    last_parity = arr[-1] % 2
    middle_parity = arr[1] % 2
    
    if first_parity != last_parity:
        return "NO"
    
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if arr[i] % 2 != middle_parity:
            return "NO"
    
    return "YES"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(is_possible_to_make_zero(arr, n))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program correctly checks the parity conditions and determines if it is possible to make all elements zero using the given operations.
