### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem as described.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation.
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and updating three elements: `a[i-1] -= 1`, `a[i] -= 2`, and `a[i+1] -= 1`.

2. **Function Analysis:**

   - **func_1:**
     - This function checks if all elements from the start of the list up to the nth index are zero.
     - If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.
     - This function is correctly implemented for checking if the array is zeroed up to the nth index.

   - **func_2:**
     - This function processes the list according to the problem's operation.
     - It iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2 and performs the operation as long as the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0` are met.
     - **Issue 1:** The operation inside the while loop is incorrect. Instead of decrementing `list[i+1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i-1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, it incorrectly multiplies these values by `list[i-1]`. This is not the intended operation.
     - **Issue 2:** The condition `list[i] > 1` is not appropriate for determining whether the operation can be performed. The operation can be performed as long as `list[i] >= 2`.
     - **Issue 3:** The function prints 'no' if `list[i-1]` is not zero after the while loop. However, this check is premature and incorrect. The function should continue processing the list before making a final decision.
     - **Issue 4:** After the loop, the function checks if the entire list is zero using `func_1`. However, due to the incorrect operation and premature check, this function may incorrectly determine that the list is not zeroed.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Due to the incorrect implementation of the operation and the premature check, `func_2` does not correctly determine if the array can be zeroed using the described operation.

### Correctness: **False**
