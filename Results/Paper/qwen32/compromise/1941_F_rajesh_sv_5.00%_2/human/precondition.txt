The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains three integers n, m, and k representing the number of prepared problems, the number of models, and the number of functions respectively. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the complexities of the prepared problems, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 × 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}. The third line contains m integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_m representing the complexities of the models, where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9. The fourth line contains k integers f_1, f_2, ..., f_k representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
