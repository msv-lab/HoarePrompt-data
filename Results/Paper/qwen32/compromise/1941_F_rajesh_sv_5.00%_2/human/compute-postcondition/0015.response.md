To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`
- `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`
- `index` is `i` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is `None`
- `max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged
- `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` and `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged
- `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

To execute the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1, as the loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `n` remains the same

State: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `index` is `i` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is `None`, `max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` and `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1**
