Postcondition: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` equals `h`, representing the optimal position in `D` after the binary search converges. If `l` equals `h`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`.**
