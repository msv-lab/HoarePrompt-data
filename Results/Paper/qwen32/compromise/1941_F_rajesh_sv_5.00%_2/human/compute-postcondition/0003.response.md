The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted as it is not used within the loop body. The loop depends on the variable `testcases` to determine how many times it will execute. After each iteration, the loop implicitly decrements the number of remaining iterations by 1, which is managed by the `range` function.

Given that `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` and it is guaranteed that `1 <= testcases <= 10^4`, at the start of the next iteration, `testcases` should reflect the remaining number of iterations. Since the loop has just completed one iteration, `testcases` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 1, and it is guaranteed that 0 <= `testcases` <= 10^4 - 1**
