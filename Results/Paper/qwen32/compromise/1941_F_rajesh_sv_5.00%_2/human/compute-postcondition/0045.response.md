The code calculates two new values, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`, based on the current `mid` index and the value of `f`. Specifically, `mid_sum` is the sum of the element at the `mid` index in the list `D` and the value `f`, and `mid_next_sum` is the sum of the element at the `mid + 1` index in the list `D` and the value `f`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` and `h` are adjusted such that `l < h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
