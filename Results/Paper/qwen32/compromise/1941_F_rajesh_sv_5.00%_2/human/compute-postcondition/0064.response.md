Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` is the index in `D` where `left - f` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `h` is the index in `D` just before where `right - f` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, and `left - f` is less than `right - f`; `mid` is the index calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

In simple terms, the output state maintains all the initial conditions except for the addition of two new variables, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`. `mid_sum` is the sum of the element at the `mid` index in `D` and `f`, while `mid_next_sum` is the sum of the element at the `mid + 1` index in `D` and `f`.
