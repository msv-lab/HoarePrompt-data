Postcondition: **D is a sorted list of unique values, left and right are elements from A, f is the next element in F, l and h are indices in D such that l == h, and ans is updated to be the minimum of its current value and max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f).**

In simpler terms: D remains a sorted list of unique values, left and right remain elements from A, f remains the next element in F, l and h are indices in D where l equals h, and ans is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of (D[l] + f - left) and (right - D[l] - f).
