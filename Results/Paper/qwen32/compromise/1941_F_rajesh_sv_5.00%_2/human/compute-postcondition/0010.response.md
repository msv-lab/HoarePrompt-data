Postcondition: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is `-inf`, `index` is `None`, and `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`. Additionally, `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`.**
