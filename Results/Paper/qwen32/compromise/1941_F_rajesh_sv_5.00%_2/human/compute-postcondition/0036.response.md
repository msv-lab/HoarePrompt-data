Initial State: 
- `D` is a sorted list of unique values.
- `left` and `right` are elements from `A` (a tuple of values returned by `func_4()`).
- `f` is an element from `F` (a non-empty iterable).
- `l` is determined by `bisect_left(D, left - f)`.
- `h` is determined by `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.

After ensuring `l < h`, we calculate `mid` using the formula `mid = l + (h - l) // 2`.

### Calculation:
- `left - f` and `right - f` are calculated.
- `l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D`.
- `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` minus one.
- `mid` is the midpoint between `l` and `h`.

### Example:
- Suppose `D` is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
- Suppose `left` is `4` and `right` is `8`.
- Suppose `f` is `2`.

Then:
- `left - f` is `4 - 2 = 2`.
- `right - f` is `8 - 2 = 6`.

`l` would be `bisect_left(D, 2)` which is `0` (since `2` would be inserted at index `0` to keep `D` sorted).
`h` would be `bisect_left(D, 6) - 1` which is `2 - 1 = 1`.

Here, `l < h` is true.

- `mid` would be `0 + (1 - 0) // 2` which is `0`.

### Output State:
- `D` remains a sorted list of unique values.
- `left` and `right` remain elements from `A`.
- `f` remains an element from `F`.
- `l` and `h` are calculated based on `left - f` and `right - f` respectively.
- `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.

Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` is the position where `left - f` would be inserted in `D`, `h` is the position where `right - f` would be inserted in `D` minus one, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**
