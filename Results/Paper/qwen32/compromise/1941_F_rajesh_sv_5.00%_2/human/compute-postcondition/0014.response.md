Postcondition: ***`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `index` is `i` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is `None`. `max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` and `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`.***
