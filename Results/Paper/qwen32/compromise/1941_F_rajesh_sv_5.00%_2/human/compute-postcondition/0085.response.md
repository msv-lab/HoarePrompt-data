Postcondition: **D is a sorted list of unique values, left and right are elements from A, f is the next element in F, l and h are indices in D such that l == h or l == h + 1. If l == h, ans is updated to be the minimum of its current value and max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f). Otherwise, ans remains unchanged.**
