Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` is less than an element in `D` and `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` such that there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`; `h` is now equal to `mid`; `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. Additionally, `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum`.**

In simple terms: The value of `h` has been updated to the current value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged, including the conditions that `left - f` is less than an element in `D`, `right - f` is greater than an element in `D`, and there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`. The relationship `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum` still holds true.
