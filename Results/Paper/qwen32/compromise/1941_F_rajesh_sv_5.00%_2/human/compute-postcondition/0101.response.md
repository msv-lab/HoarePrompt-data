The value of `h` is updated to `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` is less than an element in `D`, `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` such that there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`, `l` is less than `h` (where `h` is now equal to `mid`), `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.
