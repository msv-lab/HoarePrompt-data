Postcondition: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` and `h` are adjusted based on the comparison of `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`. `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, and `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated accordingly. The condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` determines whether `l` is incremented or `h` is decremented.**
