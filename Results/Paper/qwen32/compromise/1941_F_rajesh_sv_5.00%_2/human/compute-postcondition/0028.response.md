Postcondition: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `i` is 4, `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff` and `index` is set to 4. Otherwise, if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.**
