The value of `h` is updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `h` is at least `l + 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and now `h` is equal to `mid`.**
