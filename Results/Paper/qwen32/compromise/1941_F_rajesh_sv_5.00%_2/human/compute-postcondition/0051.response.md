The given code snippet reassigns the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` based on the current values of `D`, `f`, and `mid`. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` and `h` are adjusted such that `h` is at least `l + 2`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation: The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are recalculated to be `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
