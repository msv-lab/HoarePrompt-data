The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` accordingly.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. Since `n` is greater than 1 and determines the upper limit of the loop, `n` does not need to be adjusted.

Let's summarize the adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3 (as an example, since the exact value is not specified but it is known that `i` is incremented by 1 each time).
- For the next iteration, `i` should be 4 (i.e., `i` is incremented by 1).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `i` is 4**.

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment, and `n` remains unchanged, this is the final state we need. Note that the values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` are not part of the loop head and thus are not adjusted here.
