The code snippet provided simply calls the function `func_6()`. Without any specific details about what `func_6()` does, we can only assume that it may perform some operations but does not directly modify the variable `testcases`. Therefore, the value of `testcases` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()`, and it is guaranteed that 1 <= `testcases` <= 10^4.**
