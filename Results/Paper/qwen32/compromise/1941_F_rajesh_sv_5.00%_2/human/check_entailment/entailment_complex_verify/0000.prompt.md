You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

Upon reviewing the provided code, there are several issues that suggest it does not meet the problem description in every potential case:

1. **Function `func_1` and `wrapper`**: These functions appear to be intended for memoization, but they are not used anywhere in the code. The `wrapper` function references a global variable `d` that is not defined within its scope, which would result in an error. Even if they were used, they do not contribute to solving the problem as described.

2. **Reading Input**: The code uses custom functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, etc.) to read input. These functions are not necessary for the problem's solution and can introduce errors if not implemented correctly. For example, `func_4` assumes that the input is always a line of space-separated integers, which might not be the case for all inputs.

3. **Logic for Finding Minimum Imbalance**:
   - The code calculates the maximum difference (`max_diff`) and the second maximum difference (`next_max_diff`) in the list of complexities.
   - It then attempts to find the optimal position to insert a new problem to minimize the maximum difference.
   - However, the logic for finding the optimal position is flawed. Specifically, the binary search (`while l < h`) does not correctly handle all edge cases, especially when the new problem can be inserted at the beginning or end of the list.
   - The code does not consider the possibility of inserting a new problem that can reduce the maximum difference to a value less than `next_max_diff`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the new problem can be inserted at the beginning or end of the list to reduce the imbalance.
   - It also does not handle cases where multiple new problems could reduce the imbalance to the same value, and it should choose the one that minimizes the imbalance.

### Example of a Case Where the Code Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1 1
1 10 20
5
1
```
The optimal solution would be to insert a problem with complexity `15` (i.e., `5 + 10`), which would reduce the imbalance from `10` to `5`. However, the code might not correctly identify this insertion point, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
