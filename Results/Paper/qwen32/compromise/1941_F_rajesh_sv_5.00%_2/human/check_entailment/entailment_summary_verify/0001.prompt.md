You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the minimum imbalance in a set of problem complexities after adding at most one new problem. The imbalance is defined as the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list of complexities.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function Definitions and Input Reading:**
    - `func_1` and `wrapper` are defined but not used in the program. They seem to be intended for memoization but are redundant and not necessary for the solution.
    - Input reading functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) are defined to read integers and strings from standard input.
    - The main logic is contained in `func_6`.

2. **Main Logic (`func_6`):**
    - **Input Parsing:** The number of problems `n`, models `m`, and functions `k` are read. The complexities of the problems `A`, models `D`, and functions `F` are read and processed.
    - **Initial Imbalance Calculation:** The program finds the maximum and the second maximum differences (`max_diff` and `next_max_diff`) between consecutive elements in the list `A`.
    - **Finding the Optimal New Problem:**
        - For each function `f` in `F`, the program tries to find the optimal model `d` in `D` such that adding the problem with complexity `d + f` minimizes the imbalance.
        - It uses binary search (`bisect_right` and `bisect_left`) to find the appropriate position in the sorted list `D` for the new problem.
        - It calculates the potential new imbalance and updates the answer if a smaller imbalance is found.
    - **Output:** The program prints the minimum imbalance found, ensuring it is at least as large as the second maximum difference (`next_max_diff`).

### Correctness Analysis

- **Initialization and Input Parsing:** The program correctly reads the input and initializes necessary variables.
- **Initial Imbalance Calculation:** The program correctly identifies the maximum and second maximum differences in the initial list of complexities.
- **Optimal New Problem Calculation:** The binary search approach used to find the optimal new problem is correct. It ensures that the new problem is placed in such a way that it minimizes the maximum difference between consecutive elements.
- **Handling Edge Cases:** The program handles cases where no new problem is added by considering the second maximum difference as the minimum possible imbalance.

### Conclusion

The program appears to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the minimum imbalance by considering the addition of at most one new problem and handles the constraints provided.

Correctness: **True**
