Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to check whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting numbers that are at least 10 into their digits and inserting them back into the array at the same position. 

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Sorting Check:**
   - The program has a function `func_1` that checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the list, and if it finds an element that is greater than the next element and is at least 10, it attempts to split it.

3. **Splitting Logic:**
   - When an element is greater than the next element and is at least 10, the program splits it into its digits.
   - It removes the original element and inserts the digits at the same position in the list.

4. **Output:**
   - After attempting to sort the array by splitting elements, the program checks if the array is sorted using `func_1`.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Splitting:**
  - The current splitting logic is incomplete and flawed. It only handles splitting the current element into two digits, which is insufficient for numbers greater than or equal to 100.
  - The logic should handle splitting numbers into all their digits, not just the last two.
  
- **Inefficient Sorting Check:**
  - The program checks for sorting after each split operation, which is inefficient and may not cover all cases where further splits could lead to a sorted array.
  
- **Logic Flaws:**
  - The program does not handle the case where multiple splits are required to achieve a sorted array.
  - The logic does not consider all possible splits and their effects on the array's order.

### Correctness:
Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to handle multiple digits and does not ensure that all possible splits are considered.

**Correctness: False**

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Iteratively checking the array for unsorted elements.
- Splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into all their digits.
- Repeatedly checking and splitting until the array is either sorted or no further splits can improve the order.

This requires a more comprehensive solution that handles all edge cases and ensures that the array can be fully sorted through the allowed operations.
