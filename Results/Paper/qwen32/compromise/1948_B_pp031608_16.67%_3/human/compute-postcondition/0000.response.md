Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of `lst` is between 2 and 50 inclusive; `sorted_lst` is a list containing the same integers as `lst` but sorted in non-decreasing order.**

This means that `lst` remains unchanged, but `sorted_lst` is a new list that contains all the elements of `lst` sorted from the smallest to the largest.
