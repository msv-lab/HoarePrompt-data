Output State: **The output state consists of t lines, each corresponding to the result of the comparison for each test case. Each line will contain either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables n, f, k, a, x are not preserved across iterations and revert to their initial state at the beginning of each test case. The variable t remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases.**
