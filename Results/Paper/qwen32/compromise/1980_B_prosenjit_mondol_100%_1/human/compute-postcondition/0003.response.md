Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It compares the `f`-th element of the list `a` with the `k`-th largest element in the list. It outputs 'YES' if the `f`-th element is less than the `k`-th largest element, 'NO' if it is greater, and 'MAYBE' if they are equal and the `k`-th largest element is not the last element in the sorted list or if the next element in the sorted list is less than the `f`-th element.**
