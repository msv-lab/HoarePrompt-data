The given code snippet is `mx = max(mx, i - 1)`. This line of code updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum value between its current value and `i - 1`.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, and `x` is an input integer that is not equal to 0 minus 2, the value of `mx` is not specified. However, we can infer that `mx` is being updated based on the value of `i - 1`.

Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only express the new value of `mx` in terms of the maximum between its current value and `i - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is an input integer that is not equal to 0 minus 2, `mx` is the maximum value between its previous value and `i - 1`.**
