The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. The code does not affect `t` or any other variables except for `x`, which is now assigned the value of the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer.**
