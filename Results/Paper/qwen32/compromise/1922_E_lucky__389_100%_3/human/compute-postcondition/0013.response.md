Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` must be at least 4; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0; `i` is 2**

Natural language: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2. All other variables (`t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx`) remain unchanged.
