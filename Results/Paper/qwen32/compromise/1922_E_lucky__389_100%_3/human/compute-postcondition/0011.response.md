The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer that is not equal to 0; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0; `i` is 1.
