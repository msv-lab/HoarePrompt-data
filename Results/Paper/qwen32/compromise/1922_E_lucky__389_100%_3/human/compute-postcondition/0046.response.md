The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `x` is at least 4.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `2 ** i` must be less than or equal to `x`. Since `i` is currently 2, `2 ** 2` equals 4. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than or equal to 4, which it already is. However, to ensure that the next iteration can also proceed, we need to consider the next value of `i`, which would be `i + 1`.

If `i` is incremented to 3, then `2 ** 3` equals 8. To ensure that the loop can execute with `i` as 3, `x` must be at least 8. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` to be at least 8.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is at least 8, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` is 2**
