The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` must be at least 2, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `2 ** i` must be less than or equal to `x`.

Currently, `2 ** 2` is 4, so `x` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` must be at least 4, `i` is 2**
