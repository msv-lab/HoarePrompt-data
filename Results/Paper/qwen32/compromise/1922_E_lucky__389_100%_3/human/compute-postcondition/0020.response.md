The code appends the value of `i - 1` to the list `subseq_lens`. The values of `t`, `X`, `x`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new state of `subseq_lens` will be a list containing the value `i - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer that is not equal to 0; `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i - 1`; `mx` is 0; `i` is an integer such that `i` is not equal to 0**
