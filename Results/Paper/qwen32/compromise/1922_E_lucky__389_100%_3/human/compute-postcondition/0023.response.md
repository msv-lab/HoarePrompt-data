Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. `x` is an input integer that is not equal to 0, unless the else part is executed, in which case `x` is decreased by 2. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0 unless the else part is executed, in which case `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `i - 1`. `i` is the smallest integer such that 2, and if the if part is executed, it remains 0. If the else part is executed, the value of `i` is unchanged.**
