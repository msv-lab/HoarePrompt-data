To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `2 ** i <= x`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
- `x` is an input integer that is not equal to 0.
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list.
- `mx` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The condition `2 ** i <= x` must be true for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x` holds true. Since `i` is currently 1, the next iteration would check if `2 ** 2 <= x` (i.e., `4 <= x`). Therefore, `x` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted since only `i` and `x` are relevant to the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` must be at least 4; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0; `i` is 1**
