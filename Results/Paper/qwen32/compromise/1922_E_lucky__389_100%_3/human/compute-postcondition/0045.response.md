Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is at least 4, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` is 2**.

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
