Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer; `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `subseq_lens` has been initialized as an empty list. All other variables (`t`, `X`, and `x`) retain their initial values and conditions.
