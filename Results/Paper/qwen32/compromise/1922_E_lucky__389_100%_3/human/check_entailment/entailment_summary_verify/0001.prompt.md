You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

    mx = 0
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer input `x`, processes it to determine a sequence of powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, and then prints the length of a derived sequence followed by the elements of that sequence. If the input is 2, it directly prints 1 and 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
The problem requires finding an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. If such an array cannot be found, the program should output -1.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `x` representing the number of increasing subsequences required.

2. **Special Case for x = 2:**
   - If `x` is 2, the program outputs an array of length 1 with a single element `0`. This is correct because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.

3. **General Case (x > 2):**
   - The program attempts to decompose `x` into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1 (i.e., `2^i - 1`).
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`, subtracts it from `x`, and appends the corresponding `i-1` to the list `subseq_lens`.
   - The maximum value of `i-1` encountered during this process is stored in `mx`.
   - The program then constructs the array `ansv` by first adding all integers from `0` to `mx-1`, and then appending each value in `subseq_lens` starting from the second element.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces.

### Flaws in the Program

The main issue with the program is its approach to constructing the array `ansv` and ensuring that it has exactly `x` increasing subsequences.

- **Decomposition into Powers of 2 Minus 1:** The program correctly decomposes `x` into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. However, it does not ensure that the resulting array has exactly `x` increasing subsequences.
- **Array Construction:** The way the array `ansv` is constructed does not guarantee that it will have the required number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the program does not consider the interactions between the elements of the array in terms of forming increasing subsequences.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The approach to constructing the array `ansv` does not ensure that the array will have exactly `x` increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
