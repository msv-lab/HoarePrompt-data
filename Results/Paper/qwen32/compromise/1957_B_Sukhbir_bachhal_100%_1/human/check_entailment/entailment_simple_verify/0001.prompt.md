You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to take two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `n` is the number of non-negative integers to be printed and `k` is the sum of these integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` such that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence is maximized.

### Program Analysis
The provided program handles the input and processes each test case by constructing the sequence as follows:
1. If `n` is 1, it simply outputs `k` because there's only one number and it must be `k` to satisfy the sum condition.
2. If `n` is greater than 1, the program:
   - Calls `func_1(k)` to determine the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This function returns the position of the highest set bit in the binary representation of `k` (0-indexed).
   - Constructs a sequence where the first element is `2^counter - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set up to the highest set bit in `k`.
   - The second element is `k - arr[-1]`, which ensures the sum of the sequence is `k`.
   - The remaining elements are set to 0 to meet the requirement of `n` numbers.

### Correctness Analysis
Let's evaluate if this approach maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

1. **Single Element Case (`n = 1`)**:
   - The program correctly outputs `k` because there's no other way to distribute the sum `k` across a single element.
   
2. **Multiple Elements Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - The program constructs the first element as `2^counter - 1`, which has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation up to the highest set bit of `k`.
   - The second element is `k - (2^counter - 1)`, which ensures the sum is `k`.
   - The remaining elements are set to 0, which does not contribute to the bitwise OR and does not reduce the number of 1s in the OR result.

### Key Points
- By setting the first element to `2^counter - 1`, the program ensures that the highest bits of `k` are covered with 1s.
- The second element complements the first element to reach the sum `k` without affecting the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
- Setting the remaining elements to 0 does not change the bitwise OR result, so the number of 1s is maximized.

### Conclusion
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
