Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the position of the highest set bit in `k`, but the way the sequence is constructed does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

For example, in the fourth test case (`n = 6, k = 51`), the program outputs `3 1 1 32 2 12`, which sums to 51, but it does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. A better sequence would be `31 16 4 0 0 0` or similar, which would result in a bitwise OR of `11111` (5 1s).

To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, the program should distribute the bits of `k` across the sequence in such a way that as many bits as possible are set to 1. This can be achieved by using the highest possible powers of 2 that sum up to `k` and filling the rest of the sequence with zeros.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    while k > 0:
        arr.append(k & -k)  # Add the lowest set bit of k to the array
        k -= k & -k
    while len(arr) < n:
        arr.append(0)
    print(*arr)
```

This version of the program uses the lowest set bit of `k` to construct the sequence, ensuring that as many bits as possible are set to 1 in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
