The function `highest_set_bit` does not have the correct parameters based on the problem description. The correct function should take two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `n` is the number of non-negative integers and `k` is their sum. Therefore, the correct function definition should be `def construct_sequence(n, k):`. Given this, the precondition is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
