You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the grid is an n × n list of lists where each element is either '0' or '1'; the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0

            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
        
    #State: The variable `i` will be equal to `t`, `a` will be `'TRIANGLE'` if any row in any test case had exactly one '1', otherwise `a` will be 0, `b` will be `'SQUARE'` if any row in any test case had more than one '1', otherwise `b` will be an empty string, `n` will be the last input integer read before the loop ends, and `j` will be equal to `n`. Each test case will print either `'TRIANGLE'` or `'SQUARE'` based on the conditions specified.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an n × n grid of '0's and '1's. It determines whether the grid contains a shape formed by '1's that resembles a triangle or a square and prints 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' accordingly for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to identify whether a given binary grid of size \( n \times n \) contains either a square or a triangle made up of '1's. 

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = 0
        b = ''
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
```

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initialization of `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` is initialized to `0`, but it is later assigned a string value ('TRIANGLE'). This can lead to confusion since `a != 0` will always be true when `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'.
   
2. **Logic for Determining Shape:**
   - The program checks if any row has exactly one '1'. If so, it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire shape is a triangle.
   - Similarly, if any row has more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'. This is also insufficient to determine if the entire shape is a square.
   - The program does not check the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square across multiple rows.

3. **Final Decision Making:**
   - The program prints 'TRIANGLE' if `a` is not `0` (which will always be the case once `a` is set), otherwise it prints 'SQUARE'.
   - This logic does not accurately reflect the conditions for identifying a triangle or a square as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square based on the specified patterns. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
