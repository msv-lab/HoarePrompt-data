### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem requirements and the provided program to understand why the original assessment is correct.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Triangle**: 
   - Consists of `k` (k > 1) consecutive rows.
   - The `i-th` row has `2*i - 1` consecutive `1`s.
   - Central `1`s are located in one column.
   - Upside-down triangles are also valid.

2. **Square**:
   - Consists of `k` (k > 1) consecutive rows.
   - Each row has `k` consecutive `1`s.
   - Positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program uses the following logic to determine the shape:
- If any row has exactly one `1`, it concludes that the shape is a triangle.
- If any row has more than one `1`, it concludes that the shape is a square.

This logic is fundamentally flawed for the following reasons:
1. **Incorrect Shape Identification**:
   - A square can have rows with more than one `1`, which does not necessarily mean it's a square.
   - A triangle can also have rows with more than one `1`, especially in the case of an upside-down triangle.
   
2. **Handling Upside-Down Triangles**:
   - The program does not account for upside-down triangles, which are valid shapes according to the problem description.

3. **Pattern Validation**:
   - The program does not validate the exact pattern of `1`s required for a triangle or a square.
   - For a triangle, the number of `1`s in each row should follow the pattern `2*i - 1`.
   - For a square, each row should have the same number of `1`s.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     00100
     01110
     11111
     01110
     00100
     ```
   - The expected output is `TRIANGLE`.
   - However, the program will output `SQUARE` because it contains rows with more than one `1`.

Given these points, the original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly identify the shapes based on the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
