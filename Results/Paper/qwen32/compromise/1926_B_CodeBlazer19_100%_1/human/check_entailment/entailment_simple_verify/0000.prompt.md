You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Shapes**: The program uses a very simplistic approach to determine the shape. It checks if there is a row with only one '1' to conclude it's a triangle, and if there is a row with more than one '1' to conclude it's a square. This logic is flawed because:
   - A square can have rows with more than one '1', but this alone does not guarantee it's a square.
   - A triangle can also have rows with more than one '1', especially in the case of an upside-down triangle.
   - The program does not check the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square as described in the problem statement.

2. **Handling of Upside-Down Triangles**: The program does not account for upside-down triangles, which are also valid according to the problem description.

3. **Edge Cases Not Considered**: The program does not handle various edge cases such as:
   - Multiple rows with the same number of '1's, which could indicate either a square or a triangle.
   - Rows with varying numbers of '1's, which could indicate a triangle but might be misinterpreted as a square.

4. **No Proper Validation**: The program does not validate the exact pattern of '1's required for a triangle or a square. For example, a triangle requires the number of '1's in each row to follow the pattern \(2 \cdot i - 1\) for some \(i\), and a square requires each row to have the same number of '1's.

Here is a counterexample where the program would fail:

**Input:**
```
1
5
00100
01110
11111
01110
00100
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```

In this example, the shape is clearly a triangle, but the program incorrectly identifies it as a square because it contains rows with more than one '1'. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
