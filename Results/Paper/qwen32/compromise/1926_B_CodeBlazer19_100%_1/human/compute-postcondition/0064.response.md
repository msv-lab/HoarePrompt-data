The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is either 0 or 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `n` is the input integer, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is equal to the previous value of `n`.**
