Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is 0.
- `b` is either an empty string (`""`) or `'SQUARE'`.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `i` remains unchanged (its value is not specified).
- `t` is greater than the value of `i`.
- `j` is equal to `n`.

The `print(b)` statement will output the value of the variable `b`. According to the initial state, `b` can be one of two values: an empty string (`""`) or the string `'SQUARE'`.

Since the exact value of `b` is not specified beyond these two possibilities, we must account for both cases in our answer.

Output: **b (where b is either an empty string or 'SQUARE')**
