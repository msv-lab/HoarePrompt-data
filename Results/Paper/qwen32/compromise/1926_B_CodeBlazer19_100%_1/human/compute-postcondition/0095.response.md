Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and an n × n grid of lists containing only '0's and '1's. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up of '1's, with the size of the shape (k) being greater than 1. For each test case, the function returns the area of the shape (triangle or square) formed by the '1's in the grid.**
