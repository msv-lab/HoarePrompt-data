In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable here is `j`, and the range is determined by `n`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0 because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

The other variables mentioned (`a`, `b`, `i`, `t`) are not part of the loop's header and thus cannot be directly adjusted to influence whether the loop executes. However, since `j` is being redefined by the loop, its initial value outside the loop is irrelevant to the loop's execution condition.

Given this, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`a` is 0, `b` is '', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is equal to the previous value of `n`** (Note: The values of `i`, `t`, and `j` as described do not affect the loop's execution condition, but they are included as per the original description.) 

However, strictly adhering to the requirement to only adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we get:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
