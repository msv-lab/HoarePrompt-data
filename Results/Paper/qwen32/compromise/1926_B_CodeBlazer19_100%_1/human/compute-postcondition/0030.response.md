In the given initial state, it is mentioned that `a` is 0. However, there is no mention of any variable `b` being initialized or assigned a value. Therefore, attempting to print `b` would result in a `NameError` because `b` is not defined in the current scope.

Given the precondition and the code snippet, the execution of `print(b)` will lead to an error rather than printing a specific value.

However, since the task specifically asks for what will be printed, and considering that no value is actually printed due to the error, we can describe the situation as follows:

Output: **NameError: name 'b' is not defined**
