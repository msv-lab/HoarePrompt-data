The code assigns the string `'TRIANGLE'` to the variable `a`. This change does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `b`, `j`). Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the newly read string from input, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either 'SQUARE', an empty string, or unchanged, `j` is unchanged or incremented by 1 depending on previous conditions.**
