Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the newly read string from input, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE', 0, or unchanged, `b` is 'SQUARE' if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, and `j` is unchanged or incremented by 1 depending on previous conditions.**
