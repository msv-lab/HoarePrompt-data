To ensure the for loop can execute, we need to consider the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head only involves the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0 because the loop iterates `t` times.

Given the state before the loop starts is `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it is assigned the value `int(input())`, the only variable we can adjust in the loop head is `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it must be greater than 0**.
