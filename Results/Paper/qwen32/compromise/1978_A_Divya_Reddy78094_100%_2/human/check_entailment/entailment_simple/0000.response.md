Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description. The program's logic is flawed because it always takes the maximum value from all but the last book and adds it to the last book. This does not ensure that Alice is dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the books with the highest number of pages from each pile.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the two largest numbers in the list of pages and sum them. These two numbers represent the books with the highest number of pages in each of the two piles.

For example, in the second test case of the provided input:
```
4
2 3 3 1
```
The program would output `3 + 1 = 4`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `3 + 3 = 6` by putting two books with 3 pages in one pile and the other two books in another pile.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort()
        print(nums[-1] + nums[-2])

# This version sorts the list of pages and sums the two largest numbers, which is the correct approach.
```

Correctness: **False**
