Given the initial state, `mapping` is an empty dictionary. This means that `char` cannot actually be a key in `mapping` as per the precondition. However, for the sake of the exercise, we'll assume that the precondition is hypothetically valid and `char` does have a corresponding value in `mapping`.

The code `decoded.append(mapping[char])` will append the value associated with `char` in the `mapping` dictionary to the `decoded` list.

Since `mapping` is an empty dictionary, the value of `mapping[char]` is undefined in a real scenario. However, for the purpose of this task, we will assume that `mapping[char]` has some value `v`.

Thus, `decoded` will now contain this value `v`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is a list containing the value `mapping[char]`, and `char` is in `mapping`.**
