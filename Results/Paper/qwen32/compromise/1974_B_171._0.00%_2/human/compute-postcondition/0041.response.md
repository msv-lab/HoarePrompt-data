The code snippet `decoded.append(mapping[char])` appends the value of `mapping[char]` to the list `decoded`. Given the initial state, `char` is `next_next_char`, and if `char` is in `mapping`, the value `mapping[next_next_char]` is appended to `decoded`.

Since `char` is `next_next_char` and it is stated that if `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` has an additional element `mapping[next_next_char]` appended to it, we can directly update `decoded` based on this condition.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, `char` is `next_next_char`, `decoded` has an additional element `mapping[next_next_char]` appended to it.**
