The only variable in the loop head is `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which means `c` will take on values from 97 (ASCII for 'a') to 122 (ASCII for 'z').

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is unchanged, which means `c` has just completed its current value in the range. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1, provided it is still within the range.

Given that `c` is currently at some value `x` (where `97 <= x <= 121`), at the start of the next iteration, `c` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, `char` is `next_char`, and `c` is `c + 1`. If `chr(c + 1)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping[chr(c + 1)]` is set to `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `mapping`.**
