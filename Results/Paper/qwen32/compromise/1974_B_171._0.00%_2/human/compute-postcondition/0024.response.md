The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. The loop will execute as long as this range is valid, which it is by default since it covers all lowercase Latin letters.

The variables `encoded` and `char` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the sake of clarity and completeness, we should mention their states as they are part of the initial state provided.

The state of `c` before the loop starts is not explicitly defined, but it will be initialized to the first value in the range, which is `ord('a')`, when the loop begins.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, `char` is `next_char`, `c` will be initialized to `ord('a')` when the loop starts**
