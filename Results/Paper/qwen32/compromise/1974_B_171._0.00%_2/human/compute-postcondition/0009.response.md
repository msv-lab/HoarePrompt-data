The code snippet provided is simply a `break` statement. This statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement it is inside, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `mapping` is a dictionary with one entry `{chr(c): char}`, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry just added). Additionally, `chr(c)` is not a value in the `mapping` dictionary (except for the new entry just added). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
