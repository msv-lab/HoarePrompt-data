The code snippet `mapping[chr(c)] = char` assigns the value of `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the dictionary `mapping`. Given that `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()` initially, this operation will add a new key-value pair to the dictionary.

Here's the breakdown:
- `encoded` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters.
- `char` remains `next_char`.
- `c` remains unchanged, and `chr(c)` is now a key in the dictionary `mapping` with the value `char`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, `char` is `next_char`, `c` is unchanged, and `mapping[chr(c)]` is `char`.**
