Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` is a list containing the value `mapping[char]`. If `char` is not in `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to `{'a': char}`, and `decoded` is a list containing one additional element which is `chr(c)`.**
