Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, and `char` is `next_next_char`. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` has an additional element `mapping[next_next_char]` appended to it. Otherwise, `c` is the ASCII value of the first character from 'a' to 'z' that was not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` includes the entry `{chr(c): next_next_char}`, and `decoded` now contains the character `chr(c)`
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is 97. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` includes the key-value pair `'a': char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mapping` or the control flow.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` has a new key-value pair `'b': char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mapping` and the loop or if statement does not break.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is 99. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping['c']` is set to `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `mapping` or `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
