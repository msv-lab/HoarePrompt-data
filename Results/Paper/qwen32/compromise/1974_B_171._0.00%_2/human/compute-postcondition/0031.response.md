Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, `char` is `next_char`, `c` is `c + 1`, `mapping[chr(c)]` is `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the variables `encoded`, `char`, `c`, and `mapping[chr(c)]` retain their initial values. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
