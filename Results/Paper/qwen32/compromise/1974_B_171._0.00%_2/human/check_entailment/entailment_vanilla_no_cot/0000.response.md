Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string based on the described algorithm. The main issue is in the `func_1` function, which incorrectly attempts to map each character in the encoded string to a character in the alphabet without considering the specific rules for decoding as outlined in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. The program does not create the auxiliary string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of the encoded string in alphabetical order.
2. The program does not map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in `r`.
3. Instead, the program attempts to map each character in the encoded string to the next available character in the alphabet that hasn't been used yet, which does not follow the described decoding process.

To correctly decode the string, the program should:
1. Identify the distinct characters in the encoded string and sort them alphabetically to form `r`.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.
3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Create the auxiliary string r
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    r = ''.join(distinct_chars)
    
    # Step 2: Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric character in r
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Step 3: Decode the encoded string using the mapping
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

This corrected function should be used in place of the original `func_1` function to achieve the correct decoding.
