Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is assigned the value of `t`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input with `arr[i - 1]` updated to `nums[0]`; `ans` is a boolean value; `i` is `m - 2`; `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to `nums[0]`. All other variables retain their previous states unless `nums` was not sorted, in which case `ans` would be set to False and a loop or if statement would be broken out of.
