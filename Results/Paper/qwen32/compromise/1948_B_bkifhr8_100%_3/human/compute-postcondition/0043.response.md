The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 1`, and the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 0.

Given that `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `m - 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is a boolean value, `i` is `m - 2`**
