The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list called `arr`. This means `arr` will now hold the integers that were provided in the input, and it will replace any previous value `arr` might have had.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this code snippet. `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` remains assigned the value of `t`, and `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99. The variable `m` also remains unchanged as an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input.**
