Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i-1]` is updated to `nums[0]`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `ans` remains `True`. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**
