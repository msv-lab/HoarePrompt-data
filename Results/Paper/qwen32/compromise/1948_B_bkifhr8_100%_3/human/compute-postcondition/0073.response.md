The code snippet modifies the variable `nums` by creating a new list. This new list is composed of two parts: the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` (each digit becomes an individual integer in the list) and the integer `arr[i]` itself. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is also not changed by the code snippet provided.

Given the initial state, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
