Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the allowed operation. The logic in the program is flawed as it only checks a limited condition and does not fully consider the transformations that can be made.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. The program only checks if the current element and the previous element can be transformed into a sorted sequence by splitting the previous element. This is not sufficient because the transformation can affect elements further back in the array.

2. The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted sequence. It only considers immediate neighbors.

3. The program does not correctly simulate the transformation process. It simply checks if the current element and the previous element can be rearranged into a sorted sequence after splitting, which is not the same as actually performing the transformation and checking if the entire array can be sorted.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the transformation process by splitting elements and checking if the resulting array can be sorted. This involves a more complex approach, such as using a priority queue or a greedy algorithm to simulate the splitting and sorting process.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    while True:
        changed = False
        new_arr = []
        for num in arr:
            if num >= 10:
                changed = True
                new_arr.extend(int(digit) for digit in str(num))
            else:
                new_arr.append(num)
        if not changed:
            break
        arr = new_arr
    return arr == sorted(arr)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][can_be_sorted(arr)])

func()
```

This corrected version repeatedly splits elements that are at least 10 until no more splits can be made, and then checks if the resulting array is sorted.
