You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be modified by a specific rule (replacing a pair of adjacent numbers with a new number formed by concatenating the digits of the larger number followed by the smaller number, ensuring the resulting sequence is sorted) such that the final list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It prints 'YES' if the condition can be met for the test case, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements in all cases. Specifically, the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting numbers is flawed.

The main issue is in the loop where the program checks if the array can be sorted by splitting numbers:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
```
This logic only checks if the current element and the digits of the previous element can be rearranged to form a sorted sequence. However, this does not guarantee that the entire array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation.

Consider the following counterexample:
```
Input:
1
5
99 1 2 3 4

Output:
YES

Expected Output:
NO
```
In this case, the program will incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks local pairs and does not consider the global order after splitting the numbers. Specifically, it will check the pair (99, 1) and see that [9, 9, 1] can be rearranged to [1, 9, 9], but it will not correctly handle the subsequent elements to ensure the entire array is sorted.

A correct approach would involve a more comprehensive check to see if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting numbers, possibly using a more sophisticated algorithm or multiple passes to ensure the global order is maintained.
