The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `count`. This change does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `flag`, `j`, `i`). 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is the new string input by the user; `count` is 1; `flag` is True if there is at least one occurrence of the substring "01" in `s`; `j` is `len(s) - 1`; `i` is `len(s)`**.
