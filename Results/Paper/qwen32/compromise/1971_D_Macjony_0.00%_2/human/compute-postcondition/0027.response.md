Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is a string with a length greater than 1; `count` is either 3 or 4; `flag` is True if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is incremented by 1 if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, and must still be less than `len(s) - 2`.**
