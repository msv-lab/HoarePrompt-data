Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
                j += 1
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is the same string input by the user; `count` is the total number of transitions between different characters in `s` minus 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise it remains unchanged; `flag` is True if there is at least one occurrence of the substring "01" in `s`; `j` is `len(s) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is the string input by the user; `count` is the number of transitions in the string `s` minus 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise it remains unchanged; `flag` is True if there is at least one '01' sequence in `s`, otherwise False; `j` is `len(s) - 1` or `len(s) - 2`; `i` is `len(s)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is the new string input by the user; `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in `s` minus 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise it remains unchanged; `flag` is True if "01" appears in `s`, otherwise False; `j` is `len(s) - 1` or `len(s)` based on the last increment; `i` is `len(s) + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
