Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program converts `a` and `b` into sets (`unique_a` and `unique_b`) to get unique elements from each array.
   - It then creates two more sets:
     - `relevant_a`: Elements in `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`.
     - `relevant_b`: Elements in `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - It computes:
     - `only_a`: Elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.
     - `only_b`: Elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.
     - `both`: Elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`. If yes, it appends "NO" to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - Similarly, it checks if the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`. If yes, it appends "NO" to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - It then calculates the total number of distinct elements (`total_distinct`) that can be chosen from both arrays.
   - If `total_distinct` is less than `k`, it appends "NO" to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends "YES" to the results.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Evaluation:

- The program ensures that the number of elements chosen from each array does not exceed `k // 2`.
- It checks if the total number of distinct elements that can be chosen from both arrays is at least `k`.
- If both conditions are satisfied, it correctly concludes that it's possible to choose the required elements, otherwise, it concludes that it's not possible.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to choose exactly `k // 2` elements from each array such that every integer from 1 to `k` is included among the chosen elements.

Correctness: **True**
