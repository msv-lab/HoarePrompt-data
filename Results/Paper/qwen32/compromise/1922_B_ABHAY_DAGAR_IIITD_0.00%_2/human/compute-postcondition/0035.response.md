The code snippet provided updates the value of `total_count` by adding the value of `cnt` to it. No other variables are modified in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only change in the state is the updated value of `total_count`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the updated total count based on the previous `cnt` plus `cnt`, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.**
