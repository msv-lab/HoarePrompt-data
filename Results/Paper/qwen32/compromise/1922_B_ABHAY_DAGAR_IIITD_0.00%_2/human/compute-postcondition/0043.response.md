The provided code snippet appends the value of `res` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` is the sum of all contributions from each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()`. Since `res` is appended to `results`, the `results` list will now contain this value.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is the sum of all contributions from each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()`**.
