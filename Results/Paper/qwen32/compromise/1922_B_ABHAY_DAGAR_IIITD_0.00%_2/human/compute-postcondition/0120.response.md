Postcondition: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt`, `results` contains `res` as its last element, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.**
