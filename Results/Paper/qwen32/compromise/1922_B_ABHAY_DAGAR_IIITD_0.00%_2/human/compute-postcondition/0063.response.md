The provided code snippet only initializes the variable `res` to 0. None of the other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, or `num_of_lens`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the initial state of these variables remains unchanged. The output state will reflect the initialization of `res` to 0 while preserving the initial conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`test_cases` will be 0 if the loop was executed `test_cases` times initially; `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer; `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it; `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list`; `res` is 0.**

Natural Language: After the code execution, `res` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, and `num_of_lens`) retain their initial values as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.
