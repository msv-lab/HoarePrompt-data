Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its previous value. Since `total_count` is 0, the value of `res` remains unchanged. The other variables retain their initial values.
