The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. This means that the dictionary `num_of_lens` will now have an entry where the key is `x` and the value is `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with an added entry `{x: 1}`, `x` is the next element in `num_list` after the last processed element.**
