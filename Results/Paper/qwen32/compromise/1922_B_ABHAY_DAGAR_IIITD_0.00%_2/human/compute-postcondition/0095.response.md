The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` adds a new key-value pair to the `num_of_lens` dictionary where the key is `x` and the value is `1`. This means `num_of_lens` is no longer empty but contains one entry.

The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `res`, `total_count`, and `results` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 1 element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with one entry `{x: 1}`, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens.values()`, `results` contains `res` as its last element, and `x` is a key in `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.**
