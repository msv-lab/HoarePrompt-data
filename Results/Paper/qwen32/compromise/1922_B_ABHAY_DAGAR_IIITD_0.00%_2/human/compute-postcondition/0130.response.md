To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the provided information and the behavior of the loop.

### Understanding the Loop:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `num_list`.
   - `results` is an initially empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each test case (each tuple in `test_cases`), the code:
     - Reads `n` and `num_list`.
     - Creates a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count occurrences of each number in `num_list`.
     - Computes `res` based on the number of ways to choose 3 items from each count (if count >= 3) and the number of ways to choose 2 items from each count and multiply by the total count of all previous items (if count >= 2).
     - Appends `res` to the `results` list.

3. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop runs once for each test case in `test_cases`.

### Given Output States:
- **After 1 Iteration**: `results` contains the result of the first test case.
- **After 2 Iterations**: `results` contains the results of the first two test cases.
- **After 3 Iterations**: `results` contains the results of the first three test cases.

### Final Output State:
- After all iterations, the loop will have processed each test case in `test_cases`.
- `results` will contain the computed `res` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The final output state is that `results` will contain the results for all test cases provided in `test_cases`.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the computed `res` for each test case in `test_cases`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all iterations, the `results` list will contain the computed result for each test case, where each result is the sum of specific combinations of counts of numbers in the respective test case's list.
