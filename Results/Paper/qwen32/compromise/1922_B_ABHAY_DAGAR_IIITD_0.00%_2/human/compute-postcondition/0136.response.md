Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Initial State:
- `results` is a list containing the computed `res` for each test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 3 elements.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet attempts to print a variable named `result`.
- However, in the initial state provided, there is no mention of a variable named `result`. There is a variable named `results`, which is a list.
- Since `result` is not defined in the initial state, the code will raise a `NameError` because it tries to print a variable that does not exist.

### Conclusion:
The code will not execute successfully due to the undefined variable `result`. However, if we assume that the intention was to print the `results` list, the output would be the entire list.

Given the provided information and the task requirements, the precise description of what will be printed based on the precondition is not possible because of the undefined variable `result`. But if we consider the closest possible variable `results`, the output would be:

Output: **results (where results is a list containing the computed res for each test case in test_cases and must have at least 3 elements)**

However, strictly adhering to the given code and initial state:

Output: **NameError: name 'result' is not defined**
