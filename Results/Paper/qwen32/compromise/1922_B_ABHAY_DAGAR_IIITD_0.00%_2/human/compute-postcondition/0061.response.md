Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer, `x` is the next element in `num_list` after the last processed element. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1.**
