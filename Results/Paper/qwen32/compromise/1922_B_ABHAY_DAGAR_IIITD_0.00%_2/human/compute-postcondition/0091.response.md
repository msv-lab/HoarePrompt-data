In this task, the loop iterates over `num_list`. Therefore, the variables in the loop head that can be adjusted are `x` and `num_list`. 

To ensure that the loop executes, `num_list` must contain at least one element. The state of `x` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it will be assigned the value of the first element of `num_list` during the first iteration.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 1 element, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens.values()`, `results` contains `res` as its last element**
