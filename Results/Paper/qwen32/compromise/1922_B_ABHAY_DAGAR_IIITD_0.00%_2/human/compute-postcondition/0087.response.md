The only variable in the loop head is `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is 0, so the loop condition is no longer satisfied.

To execute the loop one more time, `test_cases` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` remains unchanged, `num_list` remains unchanged, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens.values()`, `results` contains `res` as its last element.**
