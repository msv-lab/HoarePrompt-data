The only variable in the loop head is `result`, which is used to iterate over the `results` list. To ensure that the loop can execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The state of `result` itself does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as it will take on the value of the first element in the `results` list during the first iteration.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `results` contains at least one element.

State: **`results` is a list containing the computed `res` for each test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element**
