In the given task, the for loop iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair. This means that `num_list` must have at least one element, as `num_of_lens` is constructed based on the unique elements in `num_list`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
- `test_cases` is 1, which does not affect the loop execution.
- `n` is an input integer, but it does not directly affect the loop execution since the loop iterates over `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `num_list` must have at least one integer element.
- `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair, which will be the case if `num_list` has at least one element.
- `res` is 0, which does not affect the loop execution.
- `total_count` is 0, which does not affect the loop execution.
- `results` contains `res` as its last element, which does not affect the loop execution.

The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `num_list` to have at least one element. Consequently, `num_of_lens` will automatically have at least one key-value pair.

State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, `results` contains `res` as its last element**
