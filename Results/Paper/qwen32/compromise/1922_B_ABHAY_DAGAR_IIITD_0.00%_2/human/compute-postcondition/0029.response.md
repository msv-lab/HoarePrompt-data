The provided code snippet increments the variable `total_count` by the value of `cnt`. The values of other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `res`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
