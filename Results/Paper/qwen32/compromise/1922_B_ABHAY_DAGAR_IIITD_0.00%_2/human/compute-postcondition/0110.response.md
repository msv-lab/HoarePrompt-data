The code snippet provided modifies the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's break down the change to `res`:
- `res` was initially 0.
- The expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items without regard to the order of selection (a combination formula).
- The result of this expression is added to `res`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `total_count` is 0, `results` contains `res` as its last element, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**

In simpler terms, `res` has been updated to the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items, and all other variables retain their initial values.
