Output State: **`test_cases` is 0, `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is updated to `total_count + cnt`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is also greater than or equal to 3, the previous update to `res` includes an additional `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: The value of `total_count` is increased by the value of `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
