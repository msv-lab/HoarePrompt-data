The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over `num_list`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in `num_list`.

Given:
- `num_list` is a list of integers with at least two integers.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the second element in `num_list`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be the next element in `num_list` after the second element.

Let's denote the elements of `num_list` as follows:
- `num_list[0]` is the first element.
- `num_list[1]` is the second element (which was `x` in the previous iteration).
- `num_list[2]` is the third element (which will be `x` in the next iteration).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be `num_list[2]`.

The states of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `num_of_lens` do not change in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least two integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary, `x` is the third element in `num_list`**
