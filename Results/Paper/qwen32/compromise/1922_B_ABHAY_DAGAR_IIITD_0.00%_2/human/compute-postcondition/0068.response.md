Postcondition: **`test_cases` will be 0, `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair (e.g., `{1: 1}`), `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and `total_count` is 0.**
