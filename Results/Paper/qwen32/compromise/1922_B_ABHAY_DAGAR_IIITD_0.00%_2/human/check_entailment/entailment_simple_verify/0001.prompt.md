You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the correctness of the provided Python program for the given problem.

The program is supposed to count the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks out of `n` sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. For three sticks with lengths `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `a <= b <= c`), they can form a non-degenerate triangle if and only if `a + b > c`.

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it focuses on counting combinations of sticks with the same length and uses a formula for combinations, but it does not check the triangle inequality condition.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input and counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary `num_of_lens`.

2. **Combination Counting**: The program calculates combinations of sticks with the same length:
   - `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `cnt` sticks with the same length.
   - `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` counts the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from `cnt` sticks with the same length and 1 stick from previously counted lengths.

3. **Triangle Inequality Check**: The program does not check the triangle inequality condition `a + b > c` for any combination of sticks. This is a critical part of the problem that the program fails to address.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the results for each test case, but these results are incorrect due to the lack of the triangle inequality check.

**Correctness**: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. It simply counts combinations of sticks with the same length without verifying the triangle inequality condition, which is essential for the problem.

To fix the program, one would need to implement an approach that checks all possible combinations of three sticks and verifies if they satisfy the triangle inequality condition.
