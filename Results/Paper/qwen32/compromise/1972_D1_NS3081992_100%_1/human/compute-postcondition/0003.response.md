To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `i <= m and i * i <= n + i` is satisfied. Given the initial states:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `i` is 1.
- `ans` is 0.

Let's analyze the condition step by step:

1. **Condition `i <= m`:**
   - Since `i` is 1, the condition `i <= m` will be true as long as `m` is at least 1. Given that `m` is a positive integer, this condition is already satisfied.

2. **Condition `i * i <= n + i`:**
   - Substituting `i = 1`, we get `1 * 1 <= n + 1`, which simplifies to `1 <= n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `n + 1` will always be at least 2, making the condition `1 <= n + 1` true.

Given that both parts of the condition are satisfied with the initial values, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first iteration.

Therefore, the state remains the same:
State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is 1; `ans` is 0**.
