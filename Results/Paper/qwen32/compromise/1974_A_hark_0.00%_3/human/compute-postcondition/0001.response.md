In the provided for loop, the loop head only contains the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that is not used within the loop body, so we do not need to adjust its state.

The only variable that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`. Since `t` is already described as a positive integer within the given range, the state before the loop starts already ensures that the loop can execute. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
