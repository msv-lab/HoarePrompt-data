You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: `bxsfory1 + bxsfory` (where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2` and `bxsfory1` is `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: - Since `y` is greater than 0 but we don't know its exact value, we can't determine a specific numerical output. However, we can describe it in terms of `y`.
            #   - The result of `y / 2` will be a positive number, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will round this number up to the nearest integer.
            #
            #Given the above analysis, the output will be the ceiling value of `y / 2`.
            #
            #Output:
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 99)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input, where `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is not greater than 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.
        #State: `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input, where `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`. If `x` equals 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is not greater than 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.
    #State: `x` and `y` are integers. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`. If either `x` or `y` is not greater than 0, or if `x` equals 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the values of `x` and `y` remain as they were obtained from the input, with `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts parameters `x` and `y`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99. The function returns the sum of `x` and `y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
