Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    15 0
    
    8 2

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Functions:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b
    #The program returns the smaller of the two integers, a or b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns the smaller of the two integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: `bxsfory1 + bxsfory` (where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2` and `bxsfory1` is `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: - Since `y` is greater than 0 but we don't know its exact value, we can't determine a specific numerical output. However, we can describe it in terms of `y`.
            #   - The result of `y / 2` will be a positive number, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will round this number up to the nearest integer.
            #
            #Given the above analysis, the output will be the ceiling value of `y / 2`.
            #
            #Output:
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 99)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input, where `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is not greater than 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.
        #State: `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input, where `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`. If `x` equals 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is not greater than 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.
    #State: `x` and `y` are integers. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`. If either `x` or `y` is not greater than 0, or if `x` equals 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the values of `x` and `y` remain as they were obtained from the input, with `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (where 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99) from the input. It then calculates and prints a value based on the following conditions:
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it prints the sum of the ceiling of `y / 2` and the ceiling of the adjusted `x` value divided by 15, adjusted by `y * 4`.
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`.
- If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an integer `t` from the input, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, and then calls `func_2` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value.
