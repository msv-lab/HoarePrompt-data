### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify that the logic implemented in the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly computes the minimal number of screens required to place the application icons based on the problem description.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Return the smaller of two integers.
   - **Implementation**: Correctly returns `min(a, b)`.
   - **Usage**: Not used in the context of `func_2` or `func_3`. This function seems redundant in the current program.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the minimal number of screens required for a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Case 1**: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
       - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: Calculate the minimum number of screens needed for 2x2 icons, assuming each screen can hold up to 2 of these icons (since a 5x3 screen can fit 2 non-overlapping 2x2 icons).
       - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line seems incorrect. The intention is to adjust the number of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. However, the formula does not correctly account for the remaining space on the screens.
       - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: Calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The `+1` is incorrect because it assumes an additional screen is always needed, even if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit on the existing screens.
       - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: Output the total number of screens.
     - **Case 2**: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.
       - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: Correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
     - **Case 3**: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.
       - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: Correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
     - **Case 4**: Both `x` and `y` are 0.
       - `print(0)`: Correctly outputs 0 screens.
   - **Issues**:
     - The formula for adjusting `x` after placing the 2x2 icons is incorrect.
     - The `+1` in the calculation of `bxsfory1` is incorrect and adds an unnecessary screen.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Handle multiple test cases.
   - **Implementation**: Reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_2()` for each test case.
   - **Usage**: Correctly handles multiple test cases.

### Correctness:

Given the issues in `func_2()`, particularly in how it calculates the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness**: **False**
