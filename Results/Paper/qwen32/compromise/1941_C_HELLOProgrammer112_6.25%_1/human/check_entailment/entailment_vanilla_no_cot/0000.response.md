Correctness: **False**

The provided program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string and prints their sum. However, it does not account for the fact that removing characters from one occurrence of "map" or "pie" might affect the count of other occurrences. For example, removing one character from "mapmap" could potentially remove both occurrences, but the program would count it as two removals. Therefore, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.
