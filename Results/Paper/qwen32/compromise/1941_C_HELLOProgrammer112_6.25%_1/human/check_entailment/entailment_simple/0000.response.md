### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful. According to the problem statement, a string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". The code calculates the total count of these substrings in the input string `s` for each test case and prints this count as the output.

However, the logic of the code does not actually determine the minimum number of characters to remove to eliminate all occurrences of "pie" and "map". Instead, it simply counts how many times these substrings appear in the string. This count does not necessarily represent the minimum number of characters that need to be removed.

For example, consider the string "mappppie". The code will count 2 occurrences of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in an output of 3. However, in reality, only 2 characters need to be removed to make the string beautiful (removing the first 'm' and the last 'e' would result in the string "apppi", which does not contain "map" or "pie").

Therefore, the code is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described.

### Correctness: **False**
