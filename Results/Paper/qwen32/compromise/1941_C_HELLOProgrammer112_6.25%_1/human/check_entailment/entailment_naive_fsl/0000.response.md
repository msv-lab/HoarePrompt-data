Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
mapie
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

While the output is correct for this specific test case, consider the following more complex case:

**Input:**
```
1
7
mapmapie
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

In this case, the program will output `2` because it counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" as 1 each, but the actual minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful is `3`. Removing the first "m", the second "a", and the "p" in "pie" would result in the string "mapie" becoming "mie", which is beautiful.

The program needs to use a more sophisticated approach to determine the minimum number of deletions required, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that carefully considers overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie".
