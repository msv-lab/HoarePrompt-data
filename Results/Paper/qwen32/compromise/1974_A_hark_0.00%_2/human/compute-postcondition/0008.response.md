Given the initial state, we know:
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99.
- The `math.ceil` function rounds a number up to the nearest integer.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

Since `y` is greater than 0, let's consider the possible values for `y / 2` and how `math.ceil` will affect it:
- If `y` is 1, then `y / 2` is 0.5 and `math.ceil(0.5)` is 1.
- If `y` is 2, then `y / 2` is 1.0 and `math.ceil(1.0)` is 1.
- If `y` is 3, then `y / 2` is 1.5 and `math.ceil(1.5)` is 2.
- And so on...

In general, `math.ceil(y / 2)` will return the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

However, without a specific value for `y`, we can only describe the output in terms of `y`. The output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99)**
