### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description. We will focus on the logic in `func_2()` as it contains the main logic for calculating the minimum number of screens.

#### Key Points in `func_2()`

1. **If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place `y` 2x2 icons. Each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and a 5x3 grid has 15 cells, fitting 2 2x2 icons leaves 7 cells, which can be filled by up to 7 1x1 icons).
   - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line is incorrect. It tries to adjust `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` and adding `y * 4`, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. The term `bxsfory * 15` suggests that it is trying to account for the cells occupied by `bxsfory` screens, but this is not correct. The term `y * 4` also does not correctly represent the adjustment needed.
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This line calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. The `+1` is incorrect because it does not account for the actual arrangement of icons on the grid.
   - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This prints the total number of screens needed, which is incorrect due to the previous issues.

2. **If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:**
   - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This is correct. Each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons, so the number of screens needed is the ceiling of `y / 2`.

3. **If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:**
   - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This is correct. Each screen can fit 15 1x1 icons, so the number of screens needed is the ceiling of `x / 15`.

4. **If both `x` and `y` are 0:**
   - `print(0)`: This is correct. No screens are needed if there are no icons.

### Example Case to Demonstrate Incorrectness

Let's consider the input:
```
1
15 0
```
The expected output is `1` because 15 1x1 icons can fit on a single 5x3 grid (15 cells).

However, the program calculates:
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(15 / 15) + 1 = 2`
- And prints `2`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program is indeed incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the given inputs. The logic for handling the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0 is flawed.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
