### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided code and verify whether it meets the problem requirements.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which gives a total of 15 cells per screen.
2. **Icon Types**:
   - 1x1 icons (occupy 1 cell each)
   - 2x2 icons (occupy 4 cells each)
3. **Objective**: Place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.

#### Key Points:
- **2x2 Icons**: Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, it is optimal to place as many 2x2 icons as possible first, as they take up more space per icon.
- **Remaining Space**: After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining space should be filled with 1x1 icons.
- **Screen Utilization**: The goal is to maximize the utilization of each screen to minimize the number of screens used.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
1. **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit a maximum of 3 (15/4 rounded up) 2x2 icons, this formula is correct.
   - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This adjustment is incorrect. It seems to be trying to adjust the number of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons, but the formula is not correctly representing the remaining space.
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This formula is incorrect. It should calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons. The `+1` is unnecessary and the formula does not correctly account for the space used by 2x2 icons.
   - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This prints the total number of screens, which is incorrect due to the incorrect calculations above.
   
2. **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**
   - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This is correct. It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.

3. **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**
   - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This is correct. It calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

4. **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**
   - `print(0)`: This is correct. No screens are needed.

#### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_2` is flawed, particularly in how it handles the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` and the subsequent calculations do not correctly determine the number of screens needed.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed in all cases due to incorrect handling of the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.
