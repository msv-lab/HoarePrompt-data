Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves placing icons of two types on a 5x3 grid (15 cells total):
1. **1x1 icons** (each occupies 1 cell)
2. **2x2 icons** (each occupies 4 cells)

The goal is to determine the minimum number of 5x3 grids needed to accommodate `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of three functions:
1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. However, it is not used anywhere in the code, so it can be disregarded for this problem.
2. **func_2()**: This function reads a test case (values of `x` and `y`), calculates the minimum number of screens required, and prints the result.
3. **func_3()**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_2()` for each test case.

Let's focus on `func_2()` as it contains the core logic for solving the problem.

#### func_2() Analysis

```python
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)
```

#### Issues in func_2()

1. **Logic for `x > 0 and y > 0`**:
    - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the minimum number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons, assuming each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons (since 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells each and a 5x3 grid has 15 cells, it can hold at most 3 2x2 icons, but the formula assumes a maximum of 2 per screen).
    - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line is incorrect. It should calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons. The correct calculation would be `remaining_cells = 15 * bxsfory - y * 4`.
    - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This line is also incorrect. It should calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The correct calculation would be `additional_screens = math.ceil(remaining_cells / 15)`.

2. **Logic for `x == 0 and y > 0`**:
    - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This is correct, as it calculates the minimum number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons.

3. **Logic for `x > 0 and y == 0`**:
    - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This is correct, as it calculates the minimum number of screens needed for `x` 1x1 icons.

4. **Logic for `x == 0 and y == 0`**:
    - `print(0)`: This is correct, as no screens are needed if there are no icons.

### Conclusion

The provided program has incorrect logic for handling the case when both `x > 0` and `y > 0`. It incorrectly calculates the remaining cells and the number of additional screens needed.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the logic for handling the case when both `x > 0` and `y > 0`, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
