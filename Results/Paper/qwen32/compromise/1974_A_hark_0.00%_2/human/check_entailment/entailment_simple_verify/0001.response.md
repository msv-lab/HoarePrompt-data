### Reasoning:

Let's carefully evaluate the program using the annotated version and the problem description to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
- A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

#### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program consists of three functions:
1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. However, this function is not used anywhere in the program, so it is redundant.
2. **func_2()**: This function handles the logic for each test case.
3. **func_3()**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2()` for each test case.

Let's analyze `func_2()` in detail using the annotated version:
- It reads `x` and `y` values from the input.
- It then proceeds with different branches based on the values of `x` and `y`:
  - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
    - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons (using 8 cells), `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.
    - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line is incorrect. It should calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons, not subtract 15 times the number of screens and add 4 times the number of 2x2 icons.
    - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This line is also incorrect. It should calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
    - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This prints the sum of the screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons and the screens needed for the remaining `x` 1x1 icons.
  - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it simply prints the number of screens required for `y` 2x2 icons, which is correct.
  - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the number of screens required for `x` 1x1 icons, which is correct.
  - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0, which is correct.

#### Issues and Corrections:
The logic in `func_2()` is incorrect for several reasons:
1. The calculation of `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should correctly account for the number of 2x2 icons placed and then calculate the remaining cells needed for 1x1 icons.
2. The logic for calculating `bxsfory1` is incorrect. It should calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
3. The program does not correctly handle the placement of 2x2 icons in a way that maximizes the use of the screen space.

#### Correct Approach:
1. Place as many 2x2 icons as possible. Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells.
2. Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Place 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.
4. Calculate the total number of screens required.

#### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of `func_2()`:
```python
import math

def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    screens_for_y = math.ceil(y / 2)
    remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_y - y * 4
    remaining_x = x - remaining_cells
    if remaining_x > 0:
        screens_for_x = math.ceil(remaining_x / 15)
    else:
        screens_for_x = 0
    print(screens_for_y + screens_for_x)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_2()`. The corrected program is provided above.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
