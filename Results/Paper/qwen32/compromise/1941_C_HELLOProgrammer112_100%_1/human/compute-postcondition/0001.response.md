Output State: **For each test case, the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s` is counted, and the number of occurrences of the substring 'mapie' is subtracted from their sum. The result is printed for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` from the initial state remain unchanged except that `s` is replaced by the next test case string in subsequent iterations.**
