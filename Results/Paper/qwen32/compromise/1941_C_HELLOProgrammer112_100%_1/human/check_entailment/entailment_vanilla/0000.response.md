Reasoning:
The given program is intended to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string to make it beautiful by avoiding the substrings "pie" and "map". However, the logic in the provided program is incorrect.

The program counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the string and then calculates `x + y - z` to determine the number of deletions needed. This approach does not correctly account for overlapping substrings or the minimum deletions required to remove all occurrences of "pie" and "map".

For example, consider the string "mapie". The program would count 1 occurrence of "map", 1 occurrence of "pie", and 1 occurrence of "mapie", resulting in `1 + 1 - 1 = 1`. However, to make this string beautiful, we need to remove 2 characters (either the 'm' and 'p' from "map" or the 'p' and 'i' from "pie").

The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated method, such as dynamic programming or greedy algorithms, to ensure that we account for all overlapping substrings and find the minimum deletions required.

Correctness: **False**
