The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `suma` was previously increased by the expression `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`. Now, it is further incremented by 1.

Output State: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`, `suma` is increased by `((a - 2) // 4 + 1) + 1`.**
