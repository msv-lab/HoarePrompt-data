The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `b` is a value greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `b`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The value of `b` remains the same.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is such that the loop has just completed an iteration with that value of `i`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

The state of `x` is derived from `i` and other constants, but since `x` is not part of the loop head, we do not adjust it. The same applies to `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and `suma`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1)`**
