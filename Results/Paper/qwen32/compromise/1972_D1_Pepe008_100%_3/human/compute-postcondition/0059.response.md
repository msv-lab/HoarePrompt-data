Postcondition: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is 0, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - b^2 - b}{b^2 + 2b + 1}\right) + 1\), and the expression \(((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1)\) is greater than 0.**
