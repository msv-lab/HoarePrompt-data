Postcondition: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`. `suma` is increased by `((a - 2) // 4 + 1) + 1` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, otherwise `suma` is increased by `((a - 2) // 4 + 1)`.**
