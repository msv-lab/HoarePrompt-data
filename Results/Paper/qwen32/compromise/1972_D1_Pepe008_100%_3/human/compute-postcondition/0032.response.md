To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression for `x` using the given initial state.

Given:
- `info` is a list of substrings
- `t` is `b + 2`
- `T` is greater than 0
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` must be at least 1
- `i` is `b + 1`
- `suma` is 0

The expression to evaluate is:
```
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

Substituting `i` with `b + 1`:
```
x = (a - (b + 1) * ((b + 1) - 1)) // (b + 1) ** 2 + 1
x = (a - (b + 1) * b) // (b + 1) ** 2 + 1
x = (a - b * (b + 1)) // (b + 1) ** 2 + 1
```

Now, the value of `x` is determined by the above expression. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is 0, `x` is `(a - b * (b + 1)) // (b + 1) ** 2 + 1`**.
