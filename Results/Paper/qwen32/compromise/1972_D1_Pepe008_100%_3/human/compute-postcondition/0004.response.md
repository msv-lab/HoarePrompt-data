The code snippet initializes a variable `suma` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, or `b`. The only change is the introduction of `suma` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is 0.**
