The code snippet `suma += x` increments the variable `suma` by the value of `x`. The values of `info`, `b`, `T`, `a`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. 

Given that `x` is calculated as `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`, the value of `suma` will be increased by this calculated value of `x`.

Output State: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`, `suma` is increased by `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.**
