### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the given problem, the provided program, and the annotations to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

#### Annotations:
The annotations provide the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), and for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\). The sum of all `n` and the sum of all `m` across all test cases do not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^6\).
- Inside the loop: The program processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`, initializes `suma` to 0, and iterates from 1 to `b` (not `n` as might be expected). It calculates `x` based on a formula and adjusts `suma` accordingly.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Variable Naming**: The program reads `n` and `m` from the input but assigns them to `a` and `b`. This is a misinterpretation of the variables.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Pair Calculation**:
   - The logic `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correspond to the problem's requirement. This formula does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs.
   - The condition `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is incorrect and doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
3. **Off-by-One Errors**: The program prints `suma - 2`, which is not explained and seems incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It has incorrect variable usage, logic errors, and off-by-one errors. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
