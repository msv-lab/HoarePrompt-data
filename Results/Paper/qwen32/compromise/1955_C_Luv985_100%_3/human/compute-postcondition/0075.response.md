The code `a = input().split()` reads a line from the input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to `a`. This means that `a` will no longer be a list of integers but will instead be a list of strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is the first integer value read from the input; `k` is the second integer value read from the input and has been converted to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` strings; `l` and `r` are integers such that either `l >= r` or `k <= 0`. If `l == r`, `ans` is an integer representing the number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0, incremented by 1 if `k >= a[l]`, otherwise unchanged.**
