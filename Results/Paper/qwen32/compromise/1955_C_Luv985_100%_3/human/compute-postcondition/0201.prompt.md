Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is the first integer value read from the input; `k` is the second integer value read from the input; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0; `l` is equal to `r` if the condition `l == r` was true.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `l` is 0 or 1; `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `ans` is 0, 1, or 2; `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are each decreased by `mi`, and if `a[r]` is 0, `r` is set to `n - 2`, `l` is set to 1, and `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, if `mi * 2 > k`, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, then `ans` is set to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` and `r` are set based on the condition `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is updated based on the condition and the values of `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `t`, and `k`, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. Specifically, if `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are each decreased by `mi`, and `r` and `ans` are updated as described. Otherwise, `l` remains 0, `r` remains `n-1`, and `ans` is updated based on whether `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, and `l` and `r` are set based on the condition `mi * 2 <= k`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decremented by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are reduced by `mi`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[r] == 0`, and `r` is decremented by 1 if `a[r] == 0`. Otherwise, `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`. `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
