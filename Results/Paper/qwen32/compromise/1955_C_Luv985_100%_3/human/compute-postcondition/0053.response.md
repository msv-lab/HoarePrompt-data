Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and `k` is now `k - mi * 2`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`; `l` and `r` are integers such that `l < r`; `ans` is an integer; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

In simple terms: The value of `k` has been decreased by `mi * 2`. All other variables retain their previous values.
