Postcondition: **`t` is either 0 or 1; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and `k > 0`; `a` is a list of `n` integers, each representing an integer between 1 and 10^9; `l` and `r` are integers such that `l < r`; `ans` is an integer incremented by 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**
