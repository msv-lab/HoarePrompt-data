The code snippet `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the minimum value `mi` from the element at index `r` in the list `a`. Given the initial state, the value of `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and `k > 0`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`; `l` and `r` are integers such that `l < r`; `ans` is an integer; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

In natural language: The value of `a[r]` has been updated to `a[r] - mi`. All other variables remain unchanged.
