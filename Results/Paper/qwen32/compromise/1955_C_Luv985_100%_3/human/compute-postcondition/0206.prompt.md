Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is the number of test cases read from the input; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is 0 or a positive integer less than `2 * min(a[l], a[r])`; `a` is a list of `n` integers with some elements potentially reduced to 0; `l` and `r` are integers such that either `l >= r` or `k <= 0`. If `l == r`, `ans` is an integer representing the number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0, incremented by 1 if `k >= a[l]`, otherwise unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is the first integer value read from the input; `k` is the remaining value after all decrements; `a` is a list of `n` integers with some elements possibly reduced to 0; `l` is the final left pointer value; `r` is the final right pointer value; `ans` is the number of elements that have been reduced to 0 plus 1 if `l == r` and `k >= a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `l` is equal to `r` if the condition `l == r` was true.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is the first integer value read from the input; `k` is the remaining value after all possible deductions; `a` is a list of integers with some values reduced to zero; `l` is the index of the first non-zero element from the left side; `r` is the index of the first non-zero element from the right side; `ans` is the total count of elements that have been reduced to zero plus 1 if `k >= a[l]`, otherwise it remains unchanged; if `l == r`, `l` equals `r`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
