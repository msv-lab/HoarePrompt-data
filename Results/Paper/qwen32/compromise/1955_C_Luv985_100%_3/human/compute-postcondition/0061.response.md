Output State: **`t` is either 0 or 1; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and `k > 0`; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` and `r` are integers such that `l < r`; `ans` is an integer incremented by 1; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been increased by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
