Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers, each representing an integer between 1 and 10^9; `l` and `r` are integers; `ans` is an integer; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are each decreased by `mi`, and `mi` is recalculated. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is set to `n - 2`, `ans` is set to 2 if `a[0]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is set to 1, and `l` is set to 1. If `a[r]` is not 0, `r` remains `n - 1`, and if `a[0]` is 0, `ans` is set to 1 and `l` is set to 1, otherwise `ans` remains 0 and `l` remains 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0, `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
