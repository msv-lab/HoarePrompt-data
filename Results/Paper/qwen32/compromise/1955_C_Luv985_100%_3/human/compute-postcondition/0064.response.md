Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is now `k - mi * 2`; `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`; `l` and `r` are integers such that `l < r - 1` if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `l < r`; if `a[l]` was 0, `l` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[r]` was 0; `r` is now `r - 1` if `a[r]` was 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is either 0 or 1; `k` remains unchanged; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` and `r` are integers such that `l < r`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
