Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and `k` has been decreased by `mi * 2`; `a` is a list of `n` integers, with `a[0]` decreased by `mi` and `a[n-1]` decreased by `mi`; `r` is `n - 1`; `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `a[0]` is 0, then `ans` is 1 and `l` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `l` remains 0. The current value of `a[r]` is 0.**
