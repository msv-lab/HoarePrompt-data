The code reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This value represents the number of test cases. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is the number of test cases read from the input; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
