`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n`, constraints) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; Each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case; No two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct).**
