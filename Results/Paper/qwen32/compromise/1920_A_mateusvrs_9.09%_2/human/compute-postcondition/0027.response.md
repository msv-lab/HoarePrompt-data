The code snippet updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and its current value. Given the initial conditions, `bx` was initially set to `max(x, 0)` if `a` was 1. After executing the code, `bx` will be the maximum of its previous value and `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 1 and 99, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous `bx`, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x` if `a` was previously 2, `ax` is 1000000007 otherwise, `r` is a list containing the single element `x` if `a` was not 1 or 2, `r` remains an empty list otherwise.**
