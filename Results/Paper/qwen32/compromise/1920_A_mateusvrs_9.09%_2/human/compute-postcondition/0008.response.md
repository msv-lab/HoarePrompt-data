The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `r`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` have certain values or properties. After executing the code, only `a` and `x` will have new values, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the input integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer.**
