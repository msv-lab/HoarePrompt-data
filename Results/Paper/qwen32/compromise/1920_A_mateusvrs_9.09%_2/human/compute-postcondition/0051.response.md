The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. All other variables (`t`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the integer input by the user, `ax` is the smallest `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2, and `r` is a list as defined previously.**
