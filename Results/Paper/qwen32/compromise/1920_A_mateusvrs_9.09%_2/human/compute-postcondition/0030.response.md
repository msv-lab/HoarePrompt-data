Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 1 and 99, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and 0 if `a` was previously 1, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `r` is a list containing the single element `x` if `a` was not 1 or 2, `r` remains an empty list otherwise, and `cx` includes the value of `x` if `a` is not 2.**
