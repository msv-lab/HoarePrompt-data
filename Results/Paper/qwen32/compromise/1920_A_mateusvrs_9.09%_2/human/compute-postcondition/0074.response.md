The code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to variables `a` and `x`, and does not affect the variables `t` or `n` other than the initial increment of `n`. Since `t` remains unchanged and `n` was incremented by 1 initially, we keep those conditions intact. The new values for `a` and `x` are determined by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is incremented by 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input.**
