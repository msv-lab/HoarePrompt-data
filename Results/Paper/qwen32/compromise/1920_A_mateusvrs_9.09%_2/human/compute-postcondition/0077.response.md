The code snippet adds the value of `x` to a set named `cx`. Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged except for the contents of the set `cx`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is incremented by 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, and `cx` contains the value `x`.**
