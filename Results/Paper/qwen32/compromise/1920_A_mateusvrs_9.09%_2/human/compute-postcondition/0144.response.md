To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
```

This line of code appends a calculated value to the list `r`. The value being appended is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the list `r` will now contain an additional element which is the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. The values of `ax`, `bx`, `tmp`, and any other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`r` contains an additional element equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`; `ax`, `bx`, `tmp` retain their original values.**
