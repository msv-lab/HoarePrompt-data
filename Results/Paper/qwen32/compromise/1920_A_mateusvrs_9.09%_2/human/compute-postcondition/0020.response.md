The code snippet `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `x`. Since `bx` was not previously defined in the initial state, we assume it should be initialized to a value before this line, likely `0` or another default value. However, since it's not specified, we'll consider `bx` to be implicitly `0` before this operation (as it's common practice to initialize variables before using them in such comparisons).

Given that `x` is the second input integer, `bx` will be updated to `x` if `x` is greater than `0`; otherwise, it will remain `0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `0`.**
