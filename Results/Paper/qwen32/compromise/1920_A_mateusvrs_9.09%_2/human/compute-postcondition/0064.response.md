Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`, `r` is a list as defined previously, `a` is the first integer from the input, and `x` is the second integer from the input. Additionally, `a` is not equal to 1.**
