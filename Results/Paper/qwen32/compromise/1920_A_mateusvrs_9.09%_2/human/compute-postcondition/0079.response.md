Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is incremented by 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of its previous value and `x`. Otherwise, `cx` contains the value `x`.**
