Postcondition: **`ax` is the smallest value from inputs where `a == 2`, `bx` is the largest value from inputs where `a == 1`, and `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3` and must contain at least one element. `bx` is less than `ax`. `tmp` is 0. The current value of `i` is such that `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**
