Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 1 and 99, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007; otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `r` is a list containing the single element `x`; otherwise, `r` remains an empty list. Additionally, if `a` is not 2, `cx` includes the value of `x`.**
