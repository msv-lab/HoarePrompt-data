In the provided for loop, the only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. The loop iterates over the `results` list, so whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list.

To ensure the loop executes, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The other variables (`path`, `n`, `data`, `t`, `index`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop according to the loop head.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `results` has at least one element.

State: **`path` is the last path string processed, `n` is the last integer representing the number of signs processed, `data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list of results from `func_1(path)` for each iteration and must have at least one element**
