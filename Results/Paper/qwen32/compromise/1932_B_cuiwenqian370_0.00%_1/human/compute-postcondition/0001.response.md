The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The variables `path` and `n` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`path` is a string of space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs such that 1 <= n <= 100, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line by spaces.**
