Reasoning:  
The provided problem description is about determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, leading to the apocalypse, based on the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, and each subsequent sign can only occur after the previous one.

However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` provided in the annotated functions do not align with the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to be designed to evaluate a path of characters ('@' and '*') and return the maximum count of '@' characters that can be encountered without encountering a '*'.
   - The function does not take into account the periodicity of signs or their sequential occurrence as required by the problem.
   - It does not compute the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `path`.
   - It processes each test case using `func_1` and prints the result.
   - Similar to `func_1`, it does not correctly address the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the periodicity of each sign.

Given the mismatch between the problem description and the functionality of the provided functions, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
