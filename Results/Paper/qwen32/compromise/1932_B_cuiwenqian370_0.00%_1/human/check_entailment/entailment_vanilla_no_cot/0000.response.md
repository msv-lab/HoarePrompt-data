Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be designed for a different problem, possibly related to some kind of path counting or sequence parsing involving '@' and '*' characters. The problem at hand requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the periodicity of each sign and the requirement that each subsequent sign must occur after the previous one. The given code does not address this logic.
