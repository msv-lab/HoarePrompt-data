Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not address the problem described. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur given the periodicities of the signs, ensuring that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The provided code, however, appears to be solving a completely different problem related to a sequence of '@' and '*' characters and finding the maximum number of '@' characters under certain conditions.

The function `func_1` processes a string `path` containing '@' and '*' characters and uses dynamic programming to find the maximum number of '@' characters that can be achieved, which is unrelated to the problem of calculating the year of the n-th sign's occurrence. The function `func_2` reads input, processes multiple test cases using `func_1`, and prints the results, but again, this is not relevant to the problem at hand.

The correct approach, as described in the original assessment, involves iterating through each sign, starting from year 0, and finding the next occurrence of each sign based on its periodicity while ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. This is implemented in the `find_apocalypse_year` function provided in the original assessment.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the given program is incorrect for the specified problem.

Final: **False**
