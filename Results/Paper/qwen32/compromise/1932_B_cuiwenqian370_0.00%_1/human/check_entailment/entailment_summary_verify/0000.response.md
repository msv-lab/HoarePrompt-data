### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not align with the problem description. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process a path consisting of '@' and '*' characters, which is completely unrelated to the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign occurs based on periodicities.
   - The function calculates some form of score based on the path, but it does not compute the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, but it incorrectly processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - The function assumes that the second line of each test case is a single string (`path`), which is not the case according to the problem description. The problem specifies that the second line contains `n` integers representing the periodicities of the signs.
   - The function does not correctly interpret or process the input as required by the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities.
- Calculate the year in which each sign occurs based on the previous sign's occurrence year.
- Print the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(signs):
    current_year = 0
    for period in signs:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign
        next_occurrence = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
        current_year = next_occurrence
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        signs = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(signs))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described and requires significant changes to be correct.

**Final: False**
