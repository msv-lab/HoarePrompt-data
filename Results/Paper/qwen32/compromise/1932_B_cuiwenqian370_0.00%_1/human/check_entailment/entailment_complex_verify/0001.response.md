Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the given problem. Let's break down the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements:

### Problem Requirements:
The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the (i+1)-th sign can only occur after the i-th sign has occurred.

### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(path)`**:
   - This function appears to be designed to process a string `path` containing '@' and '*' characters.
   - It uses dynamic programming to calculate some values based on these characters.
   - The function returns the maximum count of '@' characters that can be encountered without encountering a '*'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` with each test case and prints the results.
   - However, the input for each test case is not being correctly interpreted or processed for the problem at hand. The input consists of integers representing the periodicities of the signs, not a string of '@' and '*' characters.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through each sign, starting from year 0, and find the next occurrence of each sign based on its periodicity, ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. This can be achieved using the following logic:
- Initialize `current_year` to 0.
- For each sign with periodicity `period`, calculate the next occurrence of the sign after `current_year` using the formula `current_year = ((current_year + period - 1) // period) * period`.
- Continue this process until all signs have been accounted for.
- The final `current_year` will be the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. Instead, it appears to be solving a different problem related to counting '@' characters in a string under certain conditions. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
