The variable `a` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means `a` will hold the string value provided as input. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string equal to the input value.**
