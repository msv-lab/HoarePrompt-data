The value of `i` is incremented by 3. The initial value of `i` is either 3 (if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie') or 1 (otherwise). After the increment, `i` will be 6 if it was initially 3, or 4 if it was initially 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value obtained from `input()` and has a length of at least 6, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+3`, `ans` is 1 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 6 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 4**.
