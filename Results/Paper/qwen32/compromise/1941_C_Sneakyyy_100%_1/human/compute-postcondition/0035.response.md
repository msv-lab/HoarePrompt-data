The value of `i` is incremented by 3. Therefore, the new value of `i` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value obtained from `input()` and has a length of at least 3, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `s` is the substring of `a` from index 0 to 3, and `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'.**
