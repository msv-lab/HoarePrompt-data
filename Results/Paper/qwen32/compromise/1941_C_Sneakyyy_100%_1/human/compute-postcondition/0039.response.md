Postcondition: **`iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value obtained from `input()` and has a length of at least 3, `s` is the substring of `a` from index 0 to 3. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**
