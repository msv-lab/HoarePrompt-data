Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic Error in Matching Template**:
   - The program iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If this condition holds for any character, it sets `l` to 'YES'. However, this does not ensure that there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not match.
   - The program should ensure that for each position `i`, either `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from the lowercase version of the template character, or `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different and the template character is the uppercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Also, `c[i]` should not match the template.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Template Conditions**:
   - The program does not construct a template and check the conditions properly. It only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.
   - For example, consider the case where `a = "abc"`, `b = "abc"`, and `c = "abd"`. The program would incorrectly output "YES" because for each character, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`. However, there is no template that can make `a` and `b` match while `c` does not match.

3. **Output for Each Test Case**:
   - The variable `l` is set to 'YES' initially and only set to 'NO' in the `else` block of the inner loop. This means that if the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` holds for any character, the program will output 'YES' for that test case, regardless of whether a valid template exists for the entire string.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Input:
```
1
3
abc
abc
abd
```
Expected Output:
```
NO
```
Actual Output:
```
YES
```

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly determine the existence of a valid template for the given strings. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
