You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`.
- We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
  - Both `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
  - `c` does not match the template `t`.
- A template `t` matches a string `s` if:
  - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
  - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the length of the strings, followed by the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Logic to Determine Match:**
   - The program iterates over each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `a[i]` is different from `c[i]` and `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`.
   - If the condition is met for any position `i`, it sets `l` to 'YES'.
   - If the loop completes without setting `l` to 'YES', it sets `l` to 'NO'.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints `l`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic to determine if there exists a template `t` is flawed.
- The program sets `l` to 'YES' if there is at least one position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that a template `t` exists where both `a` and `b` match `t` and `c` does not.
- The program does not ensure that for all positions `i`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` either match or do not match the template `t` in a consistent manner.

### Correct Logic:
- For each position `i`, the template `t[i]` should be chosen such that:
  - If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` should be uppercase (since `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` and `b[i]`).
  - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` should be the lowercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]` (since `c[i]` must be different from one of them).
- The program should check if such a template `t` can be constructed for all positions `i`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the existence of a template `t` that satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
