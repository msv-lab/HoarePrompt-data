To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the logic of the loop and how the variable `l` changes based on the conditions provided.

The loop iterates over each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`. For each index, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are not equal to `c[i]`. If this condition is met for any index, `l` is set to 'YES'. If the loop completes without finding any such index, `l` is set to 'NO'.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: An input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
   - `n`: An input integer representing the length of strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`: Input strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `l`: Initialized to 'YES'.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `n` times (from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.
   - If the condition is true for any `i`, `l` remains 'YES'.
   - If the condition is false for all `i`, `l` is set to 'NO' after the loop completes.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - The value of `l` after the loop depends on whether there was any index `i` where both `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.
   - If such an index exists, `l` remains 'YES'.
   - If no such index exists, `l` is set to 'NO'.

Since the initial value of `l` is 'YES', and it only changes to 'NO' if the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is never met for any `i`, the final state of `l` can be either 'YES' or 'NO'.

The final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **l is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise l is 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, `l` will be 'YES' if there is at least one position in the strings where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`. If all positions in `a` and `b` match `c` at least in one of them, `l` will be 'NO'.
