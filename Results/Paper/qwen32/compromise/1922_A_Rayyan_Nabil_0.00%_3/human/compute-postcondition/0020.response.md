The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation does not affect the variables `l`, `i`, or `t`. Therefore, the values of `l`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. The variable `n` is now assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise l is 'NO'; `i` is `i + 1`; `t` remains the same; `n` is an input integer.**
