The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `l`, `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` does not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
