To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `l` is a string that is set to 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. Otherwise, `l` is set to 'NO'.

### Print Statement:
- The print statement is `print(l)`, which will output the value of the variable `l`.

### Analysis:
- The value of `l` depends on the lists `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, it checks if there is any index `i` where both `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.
- If such an index `i` exists, `l` is set to 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` is set to 'NO'.
- Since the exact contents of the lists `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `l` (it could be either 'YES' or 'NO').

However, based on the provided information, we can describe the output in terms of the condition that determines the value of `l`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. Otherwise, it will output 'NO'.

Output: **l (where l is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise 'NO')**
