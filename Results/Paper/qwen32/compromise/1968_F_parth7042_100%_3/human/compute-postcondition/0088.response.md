The code snippet `index += 1` increments the value of the variable `index` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing at least 4 elements where `data[3]` is a string that can be converted to an integer greater than or equal to 1, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1, `index` is `n + 6`, `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`, `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[n + 5])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[0]` contains `[0]`, `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries.**
