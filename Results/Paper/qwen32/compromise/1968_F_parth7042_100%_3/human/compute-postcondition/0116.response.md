Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing at least `2n + 5` elements; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `2n + 7`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are `int(data[n + 5])` to `int(data[2n + 4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries, with an additional 'YES'; `l` is `int(data[2n + 5])`; `r` is `int(data[2n + 6])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `[r]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is either `0` or `1` depending on whether `l` is less than or equal to `r` or greater than `r`; `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the string 'YES' has been appended to the `results` list. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
