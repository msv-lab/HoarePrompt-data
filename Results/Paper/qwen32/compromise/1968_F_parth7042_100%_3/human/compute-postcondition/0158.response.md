Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing at least 2n + 5 elements; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2; `index` is 2n + 5 + 2*q + 2; `n` is `int(data[index - 2])`; `q` is `int(data[index - 1])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list, and `mp[0]` now contains the value `[0]`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries, with each result being 'YES' if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, the value `0` has been appended to the list associated with the key `0` in the dictionary `mp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
