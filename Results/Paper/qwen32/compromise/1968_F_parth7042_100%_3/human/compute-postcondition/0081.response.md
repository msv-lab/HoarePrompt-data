The code snippet `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Since `index` was initially `n + 3`, after the increment, `index` becomes `n + 5`. The values of all other variables (`data`, `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `n + 5`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 2])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of indices `j` such that `pf[j]` equals `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries.**
