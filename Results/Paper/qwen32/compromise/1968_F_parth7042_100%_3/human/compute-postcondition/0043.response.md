Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is `n + 5`; `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' if `x` equals 0, otherwise `results` contains two 'YES' strings; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `q` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 2])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of indices `j` such that `pf[j]` equals `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `l` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `r` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the position where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the position where `r` would be inserted into `v2` to maintain sorted order, minus 1; `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that the `results` list, which previously contained a single 'YES' string, now contains two 'YES' strings after the `results.append('YES')` statement was executed. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
