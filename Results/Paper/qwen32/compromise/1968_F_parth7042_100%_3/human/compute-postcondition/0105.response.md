Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing at least `2n + 5` elements; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `2n + 7`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are `int(data[n + 5])` to `int(data[2n + 4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries; `l` is `int(data[2n + 5])`; `r` is `int(data[2n + 6])`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the value of `index` has been incremented by 2, making it `2n + 7`. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
