Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `a` and a set of queries. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it determines if there exists a subarray `a[l-1:r]` whose XOR is zero and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results based on this condition. After processing all queries for all test cases, it prints the results, one per line.**
