The code snippet `n, m = func_7()` updates the values of `n` and `m` based on the return values of `func_7()`. Since the specific behavior of `func_7()` is not provided, we can only infer that `n` and `m` will be assigned whatever values `func_7()` returns. The precondition that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6 will still hold true, but their specific values will be the ones returned by `func_7()`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, and both are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.**
