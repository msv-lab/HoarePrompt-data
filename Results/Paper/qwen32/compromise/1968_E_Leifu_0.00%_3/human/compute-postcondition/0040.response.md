The `print` statement concatenates the string representation of the variable `j` with a space and the string representation of `j` again. Given the initial state, `j` is explicitly defined as 5.

So, the `print` statement will output the string "5 5" because it concatenates the string "5" (from `str(j)`) with a space and the string "5" (from `str(j)` again).

Output: **5 5**
