To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the conditions under which it runs.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(4, n + 1):
    print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

This loop will iterate over all integer values of `j` from 4 up to `n` inclusive. For each iteration, it prints the value of `j` twice, separated by a space.

From the given initial state and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop will execute at least once if `n` is at least 4.
- The loop will execute at least twice if `n` is at least 5.
- The loop will execute at least three times if `n` is at least 6.
- Therefore, the loop will execute `n - 3` times in total if `n` is at least 4.

The output of the loop will be a series of lines, each containing the same number printed twice. Specifically, the output will be:
```
4 4
5 5
6 6
...
n n
```

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished will be a series of lines from `4 4` to `n n`.

Output State: **The loop will print lines from "4 4" to "n n", where each line contains the same number printed twice, separated by a space.**
