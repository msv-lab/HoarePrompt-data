Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is the input integer; `i` is `k+2`. If `n` is equal to 3, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `j` is set to `n + 1`. If `n` is not equal to 3, the loop will print lines from "4 4" to "n n", where each line contains the same number printed twice, separated by a space.**
