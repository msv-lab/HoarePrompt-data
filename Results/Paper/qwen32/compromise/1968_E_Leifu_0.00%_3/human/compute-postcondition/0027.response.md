Let's analyze the given task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(4, n + 1):`. The only variable that can be adjusted is `j`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is in the range from 4 to `n` inclusive. This means the loop will execute while `4 <= j <= n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
   - `n` is an integer that must be at least 4.
   - `j` is `i + 1` (but `i` is not mentioned in the loop, so we can infer that `j` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the loop variable, it needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains the same because it is the upper bound of the loop.
   - The value of `t` remains the same because it is not part of the loop head.

Given that `j` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, and `j` has been incremented by 1, the new value of `j` should be `i + 2`. However, since `i` is not part of the loop head and its value is not provided, we can only adjust `j` based on the loop's behavior. Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Thus, if `j` was some value `x` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `j` should be `x + 1`.

Since the problem doesn't specify the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `j` as `j + 1` from its previous value. However, to adhere to the format and provide a concrete example, let's assume `j` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration (the first iteration of the loop). Then, for the next iteration, `j` should be 5.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an integer that must be at least 4; `j` is 5**. 

If `j` had a different value at the end of the previous iteration, you would simply increment that value by 1 to get the new state.
