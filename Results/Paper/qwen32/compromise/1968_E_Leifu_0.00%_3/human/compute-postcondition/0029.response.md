To determine the output state after the loop has executed all the iterations, let's analyze the loop provided:

The loop is:
```python
for j in range(4, n + 1):
    print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

This loop iterates over the range starting from 4 up to `n` (inclusive). For each iteration, it prints the current value of `j` twice, separated by a space.

The output states after the first 3 iterations provided in the problem give us clues about the loop's behavior:
- After 1 iteration, `j` must be 4.
- After 2 iterations, `j` must be 5.
- After 3 iterations, `j` must be 6.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that the loop will continue to increment `j` by 1 with each iteration until `j` reaches `n`.

Therefore, the loop will execute `n - 3` more times after the third iteration, ending with `j` equal to `n`.

The final output state of the loop will be when `j` is `n`, and no more iterations are possible because the range has been exhausted.

The output state after all iterations will be:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the range of the loop.
- `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `j` will be `n + 1` after the loop ends, because the loop condition `j in range(4, n + 1)` will fail when `j` becomes `n + 1`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; n is the integer input; i is k+1; j is n + 1**.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `j` will be one more than the value of `n`, while `t`, `n`, and `i` will remain in their initial states.
