In the given task, the initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `i`. However, these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('1 1')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'1 1'` without referencing any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Output: **1 1**
