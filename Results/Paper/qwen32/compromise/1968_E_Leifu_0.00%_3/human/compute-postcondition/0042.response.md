The given initial state specifies that `n` must be at least 6 and `j` is set to 6. The `print` statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then with the string representation of `j` again.

Since `j` is explicitly given as 6, the string representation of `j` is "6". Therefore, the `print` statement will concatenate "6", a space, and "6" again, resulting in the string "6 6".

Output: **6 6**
