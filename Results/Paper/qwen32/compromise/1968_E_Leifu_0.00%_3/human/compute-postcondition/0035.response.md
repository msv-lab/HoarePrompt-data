Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
2. `n` is the input integer.
3. `i` is defined as `k + 2`. However, `k` is not defined in the initial state, so we can ignore `i` for the purpose of this task.
4. If `n` is equal to 3, the state remains unchanged.
5. Otherwise, `j` is set to `n + 1`. Again, `j` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it as well.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 3')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'2 3'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, or `j`. The values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement because the string `'2 3'` is hardcoded.

### Output:
Output: **2 3**
