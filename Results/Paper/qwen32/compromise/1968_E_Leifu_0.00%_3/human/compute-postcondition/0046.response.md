Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) representing the size of an n x n grid. The function processes these inputs and returns some output for each test case, though the specific output is not detailed here.**
