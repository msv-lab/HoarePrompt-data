The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'1 2'`. This output is independent of the variables `t` and `n` mentioned in the initial state. The values of `t` and `n` do not influence the content of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'1 2'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **1 2**
