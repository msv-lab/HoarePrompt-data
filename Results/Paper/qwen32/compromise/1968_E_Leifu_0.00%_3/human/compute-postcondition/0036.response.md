Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `i` is `k+2`.
- If `n` is equal to 3, the state remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `j` is set to `n + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('2 4')
```

**Analysis:**
- The print statement `print('2 4')` directly outputs the string `'2 4'`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` are defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

**Output:**
Output: **2 4**
