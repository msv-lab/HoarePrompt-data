Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\).

Let's analyze the given program:
- For \(n = 2\), it correctly outputs two points (1,1) and (1,2), which results in a set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\).
- For \(n = 3\), it outputs (1,1), (1,2), and (2,3). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), which is correct.
- For \(n \geq 4\), the program outputs points (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), and then a diagonal line from (4,4) to (n,n). This does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, consider \(n = 4\):
- The program outputs: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4).
- The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

However, a better arrangement for \(n = 4\) could be (1,1), (1,4), (4,1), (4,4), which would result in a set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\).

Similarly, for \(n = 5\):
- The program outputs: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5).
- The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).

A better arrangement for \(n = 5\) could be (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), (5,5), (3,3), which would result in a set \(\mathcal{H}\) with more distinct Manhattan distances.

The program does not provide an optimal solution for \(n \geq 4\), and thus it is incorrect.
