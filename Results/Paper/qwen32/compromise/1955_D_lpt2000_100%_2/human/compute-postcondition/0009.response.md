The code snippet `E = cnt_aa - D` calculates the difference between the `cnt_aa` Counter object and the `D` Counter object. This means that for each key in `cnt_aa`, the count in `E` will be the count in `cnt_aa` minus the count in `D` (if the key exists in `D`). If the count in `cnt_aa` is less than or equal to the count in `D`, the key will not appear in `E`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `E`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than or equal to 1, `aa` is a list of strings representing integers read from input, `bb` is a list of strings representing integers read from input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with counts being the minimum of the counts in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`.**
