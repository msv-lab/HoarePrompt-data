Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in the final `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is at least `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `aa` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `bb` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in `bb`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `m` and `n` are integers, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. If `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1, resulting in `pairs_in_D` being increased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` was not greater than 0, then `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is either 0 or decreased by 1, and `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, potentially increasing `C[out_aa]` by 1, which results in `pairs_in_D` being decreased by 2. If `D[out_aa]` was not greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is at least `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `k` is an integer, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`, and `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in `bb`. `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is at least `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `m` and `n` are integers, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. If `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1, resulting in `pairs_in_D` being incremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` was not greater than 0, then `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is either 0 or decreased by 1, and `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, potentially increasing `C[out_aa]` by 1, which results in `pairs_in_D` being decreased by 2. If `D[out_aa]` was not greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, resulting in `pairs_in_D` being decreased by 1. `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is at least `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `k` is an integer, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa` (with adjustments as described), and `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in `bb`. `in_aa` is `aa[m + i + 1]`, `out_aa` is `aa[j + 1]`. `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is at least `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `m` and `n` are integers, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. If `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, potentially increasing `C[out_aa]` by 1, which results in `pairs_in_D` being decreased by 2. If `D[out_aa]` was not greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, and `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1, resulting in `pairs_in_D` being incremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` was not greater than 0, then `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is at least `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `k` is an integer, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa` (with adjustments as described), and `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in `bb`. `in_aa` is `aa[m + i + 2]`, `out_aa` is `aa[j + 2]`. `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is at least `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
