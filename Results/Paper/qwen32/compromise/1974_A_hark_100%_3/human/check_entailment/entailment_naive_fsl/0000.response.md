Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description.

1. **Function Call Before Definition**: The function `func_1()` is called before its definition, which will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Screens**:
    - The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the number of screens for the 1x1 and 2x2 icons is flawed.
    - The correct approach is to first place as many 2x2 icons as possible, then fill the remaining spaces with 1x1 icons.

3. **Handling of Space on the Screen**:
    - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
    - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
    - The program should first place the 2x2 icons and then place the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.

Let's consider a test case where the program will fail:
- Input: `1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Program Output: `1` (this might seem correct at first glance, but let's consider another case)

- Input: `1 7 2`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Program Output: `1` (incorrect, the correct output should be `2`)

The program does not correctly calculate the number of screens needed for various combinations of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens = 0
        
        # Place as many 2x2 icons as possible
        screens += y
        used_cells = y * 4
        
        # Remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * screens - used_cells
        
        # Place 1x1 icons in the remaining cells
        if x > remaining_cells:
            screens += math.ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15)
        
        print(screens)

import math
func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that we first place the 2x2 icons and then fill the remaining cells with 1x1 icons, correctly calculating the number of screens needed.
