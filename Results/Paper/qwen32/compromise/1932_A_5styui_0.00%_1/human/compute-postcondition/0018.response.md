Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.', `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an input integer, and `b` is a non-empty string. If the current character `b[j]` is '@', then `s` is set to 1. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and no other changes occur to the variables. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.**
