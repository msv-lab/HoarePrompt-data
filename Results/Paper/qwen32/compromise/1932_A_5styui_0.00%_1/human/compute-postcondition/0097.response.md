Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.', `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is the input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `s` is 1 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if either `b[:]` is evaluated to break the loop or if `b[j + 1]` is '*'.**
