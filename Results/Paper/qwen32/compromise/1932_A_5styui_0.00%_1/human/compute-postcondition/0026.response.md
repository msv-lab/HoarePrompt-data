Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.', `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is `k + 1`. If `b[j]` is '@', `s` is incremented by 1. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `b[j]` is not '*', and `b[j + 1]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
