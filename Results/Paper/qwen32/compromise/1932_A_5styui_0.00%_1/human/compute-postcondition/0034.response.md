Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.', `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, and `j` is `j + 1`. If `b[j]` was '@', `s` is `s + 1`. If `b[j]` was '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `b` is a non-empty string or if `b[j + 1]` is '*'.**
