Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `d` is the input integer; `b` is a non-empty string; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `s` is 1 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0; `j` is the index of the character where the loop terminates. If `b[j]` is '@', `s` is set to 1. If `b[j]` is not '@', `s` is set to 0. If `b[j]` is '*', the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `b` is not empty or if `b[j + 1]` is equal to '*'. Otherwise, the loop continues without breaking.**
