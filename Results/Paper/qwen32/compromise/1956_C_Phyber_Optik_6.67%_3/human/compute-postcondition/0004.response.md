The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts since it is initialized in the `range` function.

The variable `t` is mentioned to be read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, but it is not part of the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop. Similarly, `sum` and `r` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `sum` is 0; `r` is 0**
