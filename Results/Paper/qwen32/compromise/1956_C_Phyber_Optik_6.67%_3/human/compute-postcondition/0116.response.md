Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1. The value of `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
2. **`n`**: A non-negative integer. The exact value is not specified, but it is used in the code snippet.
3. **`r`**: Defined as the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2. The exact value of `r` is not used in the provided code snippet.
4. **`sum`**: The cumulative sum as defined, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.
5. **`j`**: Defined as `n + r + 1` and is greater than `n`. The exact value of `j` is not used in the provided code snippet.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator unpacks the range object, so each number in the sequence is printed on the same line, separated by spaces.

### Output:
The output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, inclusive, separated by spaces.

Given that the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a non-negative integer)**
