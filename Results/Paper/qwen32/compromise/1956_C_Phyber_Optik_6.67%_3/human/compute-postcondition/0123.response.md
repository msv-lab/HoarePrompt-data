Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2, `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined, `j` is `n + r`. After the if-else block, there are no changes to the variables `t`, `n`, `r`, `sum`, and `j`.**
