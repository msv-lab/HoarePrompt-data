Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer input.
   - `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative.
   - `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition (though `sum` is not used in the print statement).
   - `j` is defined as `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1` and is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Condition for `j`:**
   - The condition `j <= n` is given, but `j` is defined as `j = n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`.
   - Let's simplify `j`:
     - `(n + 1) // 2` is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2.
     - Therefore, `j = n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`.
   - For `j` to be less than or equal to `n`, the equation `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1 <= n` must hold true.
   - Simplifying this, we get `(n + 1) // 2 + 1 <= 0`, which is impossible for any non-negative `n`.
   - Therefore, the condition `j <= n` cannot be true unless there is a mistake in the precondition or the problem statement is contradictory.

3. **Interpreting the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(1, j, end=' ')`.
   - Since `j` is defined as `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`, we can substitute this value directly into the print statement.
   - The output will be `1` followed by the calculated value of `j`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Given the definition of `j`, the output will be `1` followed by `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`.

Output: **1, n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1 (where n is a non-negative integer input)**
