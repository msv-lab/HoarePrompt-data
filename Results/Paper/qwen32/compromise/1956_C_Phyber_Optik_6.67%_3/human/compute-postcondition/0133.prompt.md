You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n × n matrix filled with zeroes. The function should handle multiple test cases, where the total number of test cases t is between 1 and 500, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        sum, r = 0, 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
                r = i
                sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
            else:
                sum += i * n
        
        print(sum, n + r)
        
        for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
            if j <= n:
                print(1, j, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
            else:
                print(2, j % n, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: t is the number of test cases, n is the size of the matrix for the last test case, sum is the cumulative sum calculated for the last test case, r is the largest i for which n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n holds true for the last test case, and j is n + r + 1. The loop has completed all iterations, with j having taken on all values from 1 to n + r + 1 for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n × n matrix filled with zeroes. The function handles up to 500 test cases, with the total number of elements across all matrices not exceeding 5 × 10^5. The function returns an n × n matrix filled with zeroes for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
