The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `i`, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `j` is `n + i + 1`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**
