The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of `sum` by adding the integer division of `n * (n + 1)` by 2 to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `j`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n + r + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n + 1`, `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its previous value.**
