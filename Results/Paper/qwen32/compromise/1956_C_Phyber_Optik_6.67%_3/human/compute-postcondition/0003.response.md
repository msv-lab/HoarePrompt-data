The provided code initializes two variables, `sum` and `r`, both to 0. This does not affect the values of `t` and `n` which were previously defined in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `sum` is 0; `r` is 0.**
