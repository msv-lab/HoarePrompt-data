The code snippet `sum += i * n` modifies the value of `sum` by adding the product of `i` and `n` to its current value. The values of `t`, `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Given:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is `n + r + 1`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

The value of `sum` is updated to `sum + (i * n)`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `j`, `i`) retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n + r + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `sum` is updated to `sum + (i * n)`**.
