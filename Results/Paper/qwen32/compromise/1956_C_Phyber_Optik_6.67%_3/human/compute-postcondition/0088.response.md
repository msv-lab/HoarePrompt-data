The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the loop. However, since the loop runs `t` times, we need to adjust `t` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Given that the loop runs `t` times and the loop variable `_` does not affect the state, we only need to decrement `t` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is a non-negative integer input, `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative, `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition, and `j` is `n + r + 1`.

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state, we only need to adjust `t`:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a non-negative integer input, `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative, `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition, and `j` is `n + r + 1`**. 

Note that `t` is decremented by 1, so it must be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.
