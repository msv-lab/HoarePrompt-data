Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a new non-negative integer input, `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true, `sum` is the cumulative sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition holds true, plus `i * n` for all `i` where it does not, `j` is `n + r + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    if j <= n:
        print(1, j, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
    else:
        print(2, j % n, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2, `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined, and `j` is `n + r + 1`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the condition `j <= n` is true. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2, `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined, `j` is `n + r`. After the if-else block, there are no changes to the variables `t`, `n`, `r`, `sum`, and `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2, `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined, `j` is `n + r + 1`. The condition `j <= n` is evaluated, and since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `n`, `r`, `sum`, or `j`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
