The code snippet provided is `sum += i * n`. This line modifies the variable `sum` by adding the product of `i` and `n` to its current value. The other variables, `t`, `n`, `j`, and `i`, are not modified by this line.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

After executing `sum += i * n`, the value of `sum` changes, but the values of `t`, `n`, `j`, and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sum` is increased by `i * n`.**
