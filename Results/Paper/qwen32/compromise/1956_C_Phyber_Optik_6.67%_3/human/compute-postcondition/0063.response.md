Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `r` is `i + 1` and `sum` is updated to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is increased by `i * n`.**
