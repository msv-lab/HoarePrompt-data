To determine exactly what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0.
2. `n` is a new integer input.
3. `r` is the last integer `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true.
4. `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition.
5. `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum, n + r)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `r`:**
   - `r` is the last integer `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true.
   - Let's simplify the condition: `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - Dividing both sides by `n` (assuming `n != 0`): `(n + 1) // 2 > i`.
   - This means `r` is the largest integer less than `(n + 1) // 2`.

2. **Understanding `sum`:**
   - The problem statement does not provide a direct formula for `sum`, but it is described as the total accumulated sum based on the condition.
   - Given the context, `sum` likely refers to the sum of integers from 1 to `r`.

3. **Understanding `j`:**
   - `j` is defined as `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`.
   - However, `j` is not involved in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific output.

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - The `print` statement outputs `sum` and `n + r`.
   - `sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `r`.
   - `r` is the largest integer less than `(n + 1) // 2`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example where `n = 5`:
- `(n + 1) // 2` evaluates to `(5 + 1) // 2 = 3`.
- `r` is the largest integer less than 3, so `r = 2`.
- `sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `r`, which is `1 + 2 = 3`.
- `n + r` is `5 + 2 = 7`.

### General Case:
For any `n`, `r` will be `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` (since it's the largest integer less than `(n + 1) // 2`).
`sum` will be the sum of integers from 1 to `r`, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers: `k * (k + 1) // 2` where `k = r`.

### Conclusion:
Given the general case, the output will be:
- `sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `r` where `r = (n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- `n + r` is `n + ((n + 1) // 2 - 1)`.

Output: **sum (where sum is the sum of integers from 1 to r, and r is (n + 1) // 2 - 1), n + r (where r is (n + 1) // 2 - 1)**
