To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the given conditions.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each iteration, it checks if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If true, `r` is updated to `i` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior for all iterations:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `r = 0`
   - `sum = 0`
   - `j = n + r + 1` (This value of `j` does not change throughout the loop and is not affected by the loop iterations.)

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For `i = 1` to `i = n`, the loop checks the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - The value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - For `i = 1`, `i * n = n`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` will be greater than `n` if `n > 1`. Thus, `r` will be `1` and `sum` will be `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - For `i = 2` to `i = n-1`, the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` will hold true until `i` reaches a point where `i * n` is no longer less than `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - For `i = n`, `i * n = n^2`, which is not less than `n * (n + 1) // 2`, so `sum` will be incremented by `n^2`.

3. **Final State**:
   - The value of `r` will be the last `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true.
   - The value of `sum` will be the cumulative sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition holds true, plus `i * n` for all `i` where the condition does not hold true.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `r` will be the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true.
- `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition holds true, plus `i * n` for all `i` where it does not.
- `j` remains unchanged as `n + r + 1`.

The exact value of `r` and `sum` depends on the value of `n`, but the general form can be summarized as:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a new non-negative integer input, `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true, `sum` is the cumulative sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition holds true, plus `i * n` for all `i` where it does not, `j` is `n + r + 1`.**

In simpler terms, `r` is the last iteration where the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is greater than `i * n`, and `sum` is the total accumulated value based on the loop's conditions.
