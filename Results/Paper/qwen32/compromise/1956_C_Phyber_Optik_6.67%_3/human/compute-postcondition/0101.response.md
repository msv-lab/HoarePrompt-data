The code snippet `sum += i * n` modifies the value of the `sum` variable by adding `i * n` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`, so the expression `i * n` can be rewritten as `n * n`.

Therefore, the `sum` variable will be updated to its previous value plus `n * n`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n + r + 1`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `r` is `i` and `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `r` is 0 and `sum` is the previous value of `sum` plus `i * n`. `i` is `n`; `sum` is the previous value of `sum` plus `n * n`.**
