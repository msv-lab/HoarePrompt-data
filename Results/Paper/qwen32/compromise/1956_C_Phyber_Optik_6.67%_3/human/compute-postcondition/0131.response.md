To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given code and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the following steps are performed:
1. Read `n`, the size of an `n x n` matrix.
2. Initialize `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0.
3. Loop from 1 to `n`:
   - If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, set `r` to `i` and add `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`.
   - Otherwise, add `i * n` to `sum`.
4. Print `sum` and `n + r`.
5. Loop from 1 to `n + r`:
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, print `1`, `j`, and the range from 1 to `n`.
   - Otherwise, print `2`, `j % n`, and the range from 1 to `n`.

After the loop executes all `t` iterations, the final output state is determined by the last test case processed. The variables `t`, `n`, `sum`, `r`, and `j` will reflect the state after the last iteration.

**Output State: **t is the number of test cases, n is the size of the matrix for the last test case, sum is the cumulative sum calculated for the last test case, r is the largest i for which n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n holds true for the last test case, and j is n + r + 1. The loop has completed all iterations, with j having taken on all values from 1 to n + r + 1 for the last test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the output state reflects the final test case's computations and the final value of `j` which is `n + r + 1` for that test case.
