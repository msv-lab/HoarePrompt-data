The code snippet assigns `0` to both `sum` and `r`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a new non-negative integer input, `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative, `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition, and `j` is `n + r + 1`. After executing the code, `sum` and `r` are updated to `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a new non-negative integer input, `r` is 0, `sum` is 0, `j` is `n + r + 1`.**
