To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 1, which simplifies to `n` being greater than or equal to 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is a new non-negative integer input.
- `r` is 0.
- `sum` is 0.
- `j` is `n + r + 1`.

The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `n`. Since the loop requires `n` to be at least 1, we need to ensure that `n` is set to a value that satisfies this condition. The other variables (`t`, `r`, `sum`, and `j`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `r` is 0, `sum` is 0, `j` is `n + r + 1`**.
