The value of `r` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, `r` now equals `n + 1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n + r + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n + 1`**.
