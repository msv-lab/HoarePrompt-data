To determine what will be printed by the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2.
- `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined.
- `j` is `n + r`.

### Analysis:
The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer, and the range function in Python generates numbers from the start value (inclusive) to the stop value (exclusive).

### Output:
The output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`, separated by spaces. Since we do not have an explicit value for `n`, we describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a non-negative integer)**
