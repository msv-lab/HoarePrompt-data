The code snippet provided updates the value of `sum` by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `j`, `i`, and `r` are not modified by this line of code. Therefore, we only need to update the description of `sum`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `i + 1`, `sum` is updated to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`.**
