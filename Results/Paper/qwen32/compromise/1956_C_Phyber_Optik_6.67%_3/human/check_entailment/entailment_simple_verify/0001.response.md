### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program, using the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row `i` and rearrange its elements to any permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
     - Type 2: Choose a column `i` and rearrange its elements to any permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix with no more than `2n` operations.

2. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The maximum sum is achieved when each element in the matrix is the maximum possible value, which is `n`.
   - The sum of all elements in the matrix would then be `n * n * n = n^3`.

3. **Operations Strategy:**
   - To achieve this, we need to ensure that each row and each column has all unique numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - One way to do this is to fill each row with a permutation of 1 to `n` (using Type 1 operations).

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The given program calculates the sum incorrectly. The sum should be `n * n` for each row when filled with numbers 1 to `n`.
   - The program prints a sequence of operations, but the logic for determining the number of operations and the way rows and columns are filled seems flawed.
   - The program calculates the sum as `n * (n + 1) // 2` initially, which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, not `n * n`.
   - The program also incorrectly calculates the number of operations and does not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

5. **Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:**
   - The annotations indicate the state of the program after each iteration and operation.
   - The program sets `sum` and `r` incorrectly, leading to an incorrect final sum.
   - The operations printed by the program do not ensure that each element in the matrix is filled with the maximum possible value of `n`.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The provided code does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix.
   - The sum calculation and the number of operations are incorrect.
   - The operations themselves do not ensure that each element is filled with the maximum possible value.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect. The sum calculation and the operations do not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values, leading to an incorrect result.

### Final: **False**
