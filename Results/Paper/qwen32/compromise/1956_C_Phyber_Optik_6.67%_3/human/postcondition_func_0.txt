The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` representing the size of an `n × n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific sum and a series of matrix operations. The sum is derived based on a conditional logic involving the triangular number sequence and the size `n`. The matrix operations involve printing a sequence of commands to manipulate an `n × n` matrix, filling it with values in a specific pattern.
