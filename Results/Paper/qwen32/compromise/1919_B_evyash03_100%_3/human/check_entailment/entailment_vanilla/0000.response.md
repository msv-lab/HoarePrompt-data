Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to split the given string `s` into non-empty subarrays (or segments) such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The sum of a subarray is calculated based on the characters in the string: `+` contributes `1` and `-` contributes `-1`.

### Given Program Analysis

The given program defines a function `func_1` which is supposed to calculate the minimum penalty for a given string `expression` of length `length`. Here's the breakdown of the function:

1. **Counting '+' and '-'**:
   - The function counts the number of `+` characters in the string `expression` and stores it in the variable `count`.
   - It calculates the number of `-` characters by subtracting `count` from `length` and stores it in the variable `sub`.

2. **Calculating Penalty**:
   - The function returns the absolute difference between `sub` and `count`, i.e., `abs(sub - count)`.

### Correctness Check

Let's check if the logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum penalty:

- **Case 1: All '+' or All '-'**:
  - If the string consists entirely of `+` characters, `count` will be equal to `length` and `sub` will be `0`. The function will return `abs(0 - length)`, which is `length`. This is correct because the penalty for each `+` is `1 * 1 = 1`, and there are `length` such penalties.
  - Similarly, if the string consists entirely of `-` characters, `count` will be `0` and `sub` will be `length`. The function will return `abs(length - 0)`, which is `length`. This is correct because the penalty for each `-` is `1 * 1 = 1`, and there are `length` such penalties.

- **Case 2: Mixed '+' and '-'**:
  - The function does not consider any splitting strategy. It simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters. This does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.
  - For example, consider the test case `+-+-+-`:
    - The function will count `3` `+` and `3` `-`, and return `abs(3 - 3) = 0`.
    - However, the optimal way to split this string to minimize the penalty is to split it into `([+,-],[+,-],[+,-])`, each subarray having a penalty of `0`, resulting in a total penalty of `0`.
    - The function's output is correct for this specific case, but it is not a general solution.

- **General Case**:
  - The function does not implement any logic to explore different ways of splitting the string to minimize the penalty. It only considers the difference in counts of `+` and `-` characters, which is insufficient for the problem.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for all cases. It only considers a specific calculation that happens to work for some simple cases but does not account for the optimal splitting strategy required by the problem.

**Correctness: False**
