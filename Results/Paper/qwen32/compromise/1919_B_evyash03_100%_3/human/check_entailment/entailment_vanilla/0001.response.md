Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to split a given string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length. The elements of the array `a` are derived from the string `s` where each '+' is converted to 1 and each '-' is converted to -1.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself. It then calls a function `func_1(expression, length)` to compute the minimum penalty for that test case.

The function `func_1` does the following:
1. It counts the number of '+' characters in the string.
2. It calculates `sub` as the number of '-' characters (which is `length - count`).
3. It returns the absolute difference between the count of '+' and '-' characters.

### Correctness Check:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify if the function `func_1` correctly computes the minimum penalty for the given problem.

Let's consider the example cases:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `+`
   - `count` of '+' is 1, `sub` of '-' is 0.
   - Penalty: `abs(1 - 0) = 1`
   - Correct output: `1`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `-----`
   - `count` of '+' is 0, `sub` of '-' is 5.
   - Penalty: `abs(0 - 5) = 5`
   - Correct output: `5`

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `+-+-+-`
   - `count` of '+' is 3, `sub` of '-' is 3.
   - Penalty: `abs(3 - 3) = 0`
   - Correct output: `0`

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `--+++++++`
   - `count` of '+' is 7, `sub` of '-' is 2.
   - Penalty: `abs(7 - 2) = 5`
   - Incorrect output: `4` (The program outputs `5`, but the correct answer is `4`, which can be achieved by splitting into `[-1, -1]` and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`)

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `+---++++-+++++---++-`
   - This case is more complex and the program's logic does not guarantee the optimal split.
   - Incorrect output: `4` (The program does not guarantee the minimum penalty)

From the analysis, it is clear that the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for all test cases. It only calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which does not necessarily minimize the total penalty.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not implement an algorithm that finds the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

**Correctness: False**
