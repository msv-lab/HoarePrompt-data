Let's analyze the problem and the provided Python code to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by drawing diagonals between chosen vertices of a regular polygon. The constraints are:
- The polygon has `n` sides.
- `x` vertices have already been chosen.
- We can choose no more than `y` additional vertices (in this easy version, `y = 0`).
- We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces formed by these vertices.

### Key Observations

1. **Vertices and Triangles**: To form a triangle, we need at least 3 vertices. If we have `k` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles we can form is `k-2` (since each triangle uses up 3 vertices and one vertex is left over after forming `k-2` triangles).
2. **Chosen Vertices**: Since `y = 0`, we can only use the `x` vertices that are already chosen.
3. **Maximizing Triangles**: To maximize the number of triangles, we need to ensure that the vertices are chosen in such a way that they can form the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles. This can be achieved by selecting vertices such that they are as evenly spaced as possible around the polygon.

### Solution Approach

Given the constraints and observations, the solution should:
1. Count the number of chosen vertices `x`.
2. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with `x` vertices is `x-2`.

### Code Analysis

The provided code includes a large number of functions, but none of them seem to directly solve the problem described. The code includes functions for various unrelated tasks like graph traversal, prime factorization, and more. There is no function that calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles based on the given vertices.

### Correctness

Since the provided code does not contain any logic to solve the specific problem of determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles, it is incorrect for this problem.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
