Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least one more adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[ver]` set to 1, `q` contains `node` if `vis[node]` was 0 before the execution, otherwise `q` remains empty, `node` is the next unprocessed adjacent vertex in `graph[ver]`. Additionally, `q` now includes `node` as an appended element.**

In natural language: The queue `q` now includes the `node` as an additional element. All other variables remain unchanged.
