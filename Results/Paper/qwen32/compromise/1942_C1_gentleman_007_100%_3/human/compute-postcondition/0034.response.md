Output State: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` and is a valid index in `graph`; `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have more than one element; `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, and `vis[node]` is now 1; `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]` after the previously processed node; `q` now includes `node` as its last element.**

In natural language: The value at `vis[node]` has been set to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
