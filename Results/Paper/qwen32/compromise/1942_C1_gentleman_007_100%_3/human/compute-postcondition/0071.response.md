Postcondition: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a)` and `j` from 0 to `len(b)`. The final value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`. If `dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `j` is `len(b) - 2`. Otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 2` and `j` is either `len(b) - 1` or `len(b) - 2` depending on whether `dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]`. `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]` or `a[i + 1]`, and in some cases, it may contain both `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.**
