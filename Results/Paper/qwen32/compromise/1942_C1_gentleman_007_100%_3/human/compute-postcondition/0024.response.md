Postcondition: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` and is a valid index in `graph`. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least one element. `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise. `q` has had its leftmost element removed. The current value of `node` has not been visited, i.e., `vis[node]` is 0.**
