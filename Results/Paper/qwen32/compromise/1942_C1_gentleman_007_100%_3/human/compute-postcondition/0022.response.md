To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`. This means `ver` holds the value of the first element that was removed from the queue `q`.
   - `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each index represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices. This information is not directly relevant to the print statement.
   - `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise. This information is also not directly relevant to the print statement.
   - `q` has had its leftmost element removed. This confirms that `ver` is the element that was removed from `q`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print(ver, end=' ')`. This means it will print the value of `ver` followed by a space, rather than the default newline character.

3. **Determining the Output**:
   - `ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` before it was removed. Since the exact value of `q` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ver`. However, we know that `ver` is the value of the first element that was in `q`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output the value of `ver` followed by a space.

Given this analysis, the output can be described as:

Output: **ver (where ver is the value of the first element that was in the queue `q`)**
