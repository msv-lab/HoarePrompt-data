Postcondition: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` and is a valid index in `graph`; `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have more than one element; `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise. If `vis[node]` was initially 0, then `vis[node]` is now 1 and `node` is added to the end of `q`. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains unchanged and `q` is not modified.**
