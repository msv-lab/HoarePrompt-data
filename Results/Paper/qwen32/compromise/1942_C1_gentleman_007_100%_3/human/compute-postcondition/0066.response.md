Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a)` and `j` from 0 to `len(b)`. The final value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a) - 2` and must be greater than 0, `j` is `len(b) - 1` and must be greater than 0. `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i + 1]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `i` has been decremented by 1, so it is now `len(a) - 2`. The value of `j` remains `len(b) - 1`. The list `l` either remains unchanged or still contains the element `a[i + 1]`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
