The code `ver = q.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque `q` and assigns it to the variable `ver`. Given the initial state, `q` contains only one element, which is `ver`. After executing this line, `q` will be empty, and `ver` will still hold the value that was originally in `q`.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each index represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[ver]` set to 1, and `q` is an empty deque.**
