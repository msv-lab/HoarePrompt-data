Functionality: **The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from a given vertex `ver` in a graph represented by `graph`. It modifies the `vis` list to mark all vertices reachable from `ver` as visited by setting their corresponding entries to 1. The function does not return a value but updates the `vis` list in place.**
