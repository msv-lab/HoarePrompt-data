The code snippet `l.append(a[i])` appends the character `a[i]` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, the value of `a[i]` is added to the list `l`, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a)` and `j` from 0 to `len(b)`. The final value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a) - 1` and must be greater than 0, `j` is `len(b) - 1` and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list containing `a[i]`. `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`.**
