The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m`, a non-negative integer representing the number of pairs of vertices that are connected by diagonals. It returns a 2D list `l` of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` are set to `1` for each pair `(x, y)` obtained from `func_1()` across all `m` iterations.
