The value of `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0] + s[1], ..., s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]]`, `sb` is `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1] + b[n]`, `ss` is `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]`, `i` is `n-1`, `ptsb` is `[(sb + (k - n) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0], ..., (sb + b[n-1]) + (k - n) * b[n-1], (sb + b[n]) + (k - n - 1) * b[n]]`, `ptss` is `[pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1], pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], ..., pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1]]`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `foundb` is True, and `founds` is False. Additionally, the values of `b` and `s` remain unchanged except `s` now includes `a[ps - 1]` as its last element. `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. `ps` is now `p[ps - 1]`. `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**
