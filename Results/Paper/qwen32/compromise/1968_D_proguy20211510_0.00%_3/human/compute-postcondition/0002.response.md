The given Python code snippet only initializes a variable `alpha` with the string of lowercase English letters. No other variables are affected, and no computations or changes are made to the initial state of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each testcase, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `p` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n for all i; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO'; `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
