The code appends the value `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` to the list `ptss`. Given the initial state, `i` is `k-1`, `rem` is `0`, and `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k])]`. Therefore, `pres[i]` is `sum(s[0:k])` and `rem * s[i]` is `0 * s[k-1]`, which is `0`. So, `ptss` will have the value `sum(s[0:k])` appended to it.

Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k])]`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k])`, `i` is `k-1`, `ptsb` is `[preb[i] + rem * b[i]]`, `ptss` is `[sum(s[0:k])]`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged, `rem` is `0`.**
