The code snippet assigns a value to the variable `rem` based on the expression `k - (i + 1)`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. The value of `rem` will be `k - n` since `i` is `n-1`.

Output State: **`preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is a list with at least one element, `sb` is `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1]`, `ss` is `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]`, `i` is `n-1`, `ptsb` is `[]`, `ptss` is `[]`, `rem` is `k - n`**.
