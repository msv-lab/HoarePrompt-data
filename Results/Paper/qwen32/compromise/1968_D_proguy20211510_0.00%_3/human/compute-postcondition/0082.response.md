Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` is a boolean value; `foundb` is a boolean value; `i` is 2; `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and `foundb` and `founds` are both True, then `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa`. Otherwise, `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`.**
