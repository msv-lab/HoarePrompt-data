Output State: **`s` is a list that must have at least 1 element; `preb` has a new element which is the sum of `sb` and `b[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `sb` is updated to `sb + b[i]`.**

In simpler terms, `s` still has at least one element, `preb` has a new element that is the sum of the old `sb` and `b[i]`, `i` is now one more than its previous value, and `sb` is now the sum of its old value and `b[i]`.
