Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0] + s[1], ..., s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]]`, `sb` is updated to `sb + maxa` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, otherwise it remains `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1] + b[n]`. `ss` is `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]`, `i` is `n`, `ptsb` is updated to `[(sb + maxa + (k - n - 1) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0], ..., (sb + b[n-1]) + (k - n) * b[n-1], (sb + b[n]) + (k - n - 1) * b[n]]` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, otherwise it remains `[(sb + (k - n) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0], ..., (sb + b[n-1]) + (k - n) * b[n-1], (sb + b[n]) + (k - n - 1) * b[n]]`. `ptss` is `[pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1], pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], ..., pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1]]`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `foundb` is True, and `founds` is a boolean that can be either True or False. `b` is now `b` with an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `sb` is updated to `sb + maxa` and `ptsb` is adjusted accordingly. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, `b` includes an additional element `(k - (n + 1)) * maxa` and `s` includes an additional element `(k - (n + 1)) * maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `s` includes `a[ps - 1]` as its last element. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `foundb` and `founds` are both True.** 

Natural Language: The list `b` now includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `sb` is updated to `sb + maxa` and `ptsb` is adjusted accordingly. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, `b` includes an additional element `(k - (n + 1)) * maxa` and `s` includes an additional element `(k - (n + 1)) * maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `s` includes `a[ps - 1]` as its last element. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `foundb` and `founds` are both True. All other variables remain unchanged except for `b` and potentially `sb` and `ptsb`.
