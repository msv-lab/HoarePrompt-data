The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k - (i + 1)`. The values of `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `i`, `ptsb`, and `ptss` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`preb` is the cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list with at least one element, `sb` is `sum(b)`, `ss` is `sum(s)`, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `ptsb` is `[]`, `ptss` is `[]`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`**.
