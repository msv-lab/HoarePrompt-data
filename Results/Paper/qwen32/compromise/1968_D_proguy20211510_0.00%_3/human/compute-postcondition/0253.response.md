The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('Sasha')
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Sasha'`. The initial state description provides details about various variables (`preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `i`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `foundb`, `founds`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly given by the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
