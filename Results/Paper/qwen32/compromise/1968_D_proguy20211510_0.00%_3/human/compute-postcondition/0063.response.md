Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 1. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `foundb` is True and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`. Otherwise, `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]` and `s` remains unchanged. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, then `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.**
