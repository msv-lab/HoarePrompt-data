The code snippet `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the element at index `ps - 1` of list `a` to the list `s`. This means the list `s` will include an additional element, which is `a[ps - 1]`.

Let's update the variables based on this change:

- `s` is updated to include `a[ps - 1]` as its last element.
- `founds` is set to `True` because an element was appended to `s`.

The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state, except for `s` and `founds`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is recalculated and includes `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1] + a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `sb` is updated to `sb + maxa` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1] + b[n]`, `ss` is recalculated and includes `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `i` is `n + 1`, `ptsb` is adjusted based on whether `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `ptss` is recalculated and includes `pres[n] + (k - n - 1) * s[n]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1], a[ps - 1]]`.**
