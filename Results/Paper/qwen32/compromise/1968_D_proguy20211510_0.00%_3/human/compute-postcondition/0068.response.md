The code snippet `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the element at index `ps - 1` of the list `a` to the list `s`. This means that the list `s` will now include an additional element, which is `a[ps - 1]`. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 1; `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`.**
