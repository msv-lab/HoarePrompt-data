Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 2; `b` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa`; `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms:
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb`, `i`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The loop or if statement is exited.
