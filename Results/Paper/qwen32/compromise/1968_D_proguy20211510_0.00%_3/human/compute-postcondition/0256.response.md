The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bodya'`. The initial state describes various lists and variables, but none of these are used in the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or lists defined in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several lists and variables such as `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `i`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb`.
2. The `print` statement is `print('Bodya')`.
3. The string `'Bodya'` is a literal and does not depend on any of the variables or lists defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
