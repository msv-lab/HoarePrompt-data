Postcondition: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`. `sb` is `k*maxa`. `i` is `2`. `ptsb` is recalculated based on the updated `preb` and `b`. `maxa` is `max(a)`. `n` is the first value from the input as an integer. `k` is greater than 0. `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`. `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`. `p` is a list of integers read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `foundb` is `True`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, `b` includes `(k - 2) * maxa` and `s` is recalculated to include `(k - 2) * maxa`. `maxb` is recalculated based on the new `ptsb`. If `foundb` is `True` and `founds` is `False`, `b` includes `maxa` and `s` is recalculated based on `founds` and `maxa`.**
