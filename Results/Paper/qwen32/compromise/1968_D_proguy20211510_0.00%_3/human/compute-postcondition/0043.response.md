The code snippet `s.append(maxa)` adds the value of `maxa` to the list `s`. 

Given the initial state, the value of `s` is initially `[(k - 1) * maxa]`. After appending `maxa` to `s`, the new value of `s` will be `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` is True; `foundb` is a boolean value; `i` is 0. If `foundb` is True, then `b` is a list containing `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]` and `s` is a list containing `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]`. If `foundb` is False, then `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `b` is a list containing one element `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` contains `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]`.**
