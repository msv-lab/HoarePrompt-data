The code appends a calculated value to the list `b`. The value appended is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the expression simplifies to `(k - 1) * maxa`. Therefore, the list `b` will now contain one element, which is `(k - 1) * maxa`.

Other variables remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing one element `[(k - 1) * maxa]`, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is 0.**
