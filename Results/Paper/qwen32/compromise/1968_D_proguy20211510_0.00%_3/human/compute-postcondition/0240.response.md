Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k])]`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k])`, `i` is `k-1`, `ptsb` is `[preb[i] + rem * b[i]]`, `ptss` is `[]`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged, `rem` is `0`.**

Explanation: The value of `ptsb` is updated to include the new element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Since `i` is `k-1`, `preb[i]` is `k*maxa`. Given that `rem` is `0`, the expression simplifies to `k*maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
