Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k])]`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k])`, `i` is `k-1`, `ptsb` is `[]`, `ptss` is `[]`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged, `rem` is `0`.** 

In natural language: The value of `rem` is calculated as `k - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - (k - 1 + 1)`, resulting in `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
