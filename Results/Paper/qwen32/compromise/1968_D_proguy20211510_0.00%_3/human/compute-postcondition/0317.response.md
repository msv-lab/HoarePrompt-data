Postcondition: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`. `sb` is `k*maxa`. `i` is `1`. `ptsb` is recalculated based on the updated `preb` and `b`. `maxa` is `max(a)`. `n` is the first value from the input as an integer. `k` is greater than 0. `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`. `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`. `p` is a list of integers read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `foundb` is `True`. If `foundb` is `True`, `b` includes `maxa` as an additional element. If `founds` is `True`, `pres` is recalculated based on the new `s` which includes `maxa` at the end, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k]) + maxa`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres`, `maxs` is recalculated based on the new `ptss`, and `s` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k]), maxa]`. If `founds` is `False`, then if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k]), ss + maxa]`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k]) + maxa`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres`, `maxs` is recalculated based on the new `ptss`, `founds` is `True`, and `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[k-1], maxa]`. Otherwise, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k+1])]`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k+1])`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres`, `maxs` is recalculated based on the new `ptss`, `founds` is `False`, and `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[k-1], a[ps - 1]]`. `maxb` is recalculated based on the new `ptsb`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, `b` includes `(k - 2) * maxa` and `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[k-1], (k - 2) * maxa]`. Otherwise, `b` and `s` remain unchanged as described above.**
