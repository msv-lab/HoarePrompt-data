Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `preb` is the cumulative sums of `b`.
- `pres` is the cumulative sums of `s`.
- `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`.
- `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`.
- `i` is `len(pres) - 1`.
- `ptsb` is a list calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`.
- `ptss` is a list calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
- `maxs` is greater than `maxb`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Sasha')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('Sasha')` directly outputs the string 'Sasha'. It does not depend on any of the variables `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `i`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, or `maxb`. The condition `maxs > maxb` is given but does not affect the execution of this particular print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string 'Sasha'.

Output: **Sasha**
