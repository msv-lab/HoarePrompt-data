Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` is a boolean value; `foundb` is True; `i` is 2. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, then `b` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa` and `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa`. Otherwise, `b` and `s` remain unchanged except for the addition of `a[ps - 1]` as per the initial conditions.**

Natural Language: The value of `foundb` has been set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
