The value of `ps` is updated to be the value at the index `ps - 1` in the list `p`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 2; `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`.**
