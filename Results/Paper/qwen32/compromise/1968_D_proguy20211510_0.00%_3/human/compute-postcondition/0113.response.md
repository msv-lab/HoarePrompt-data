The code snippet appends a new value to the list `ptsb`. The value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is `n-1`, `rem` is `k - n`, and `preb` is a list where each element is the sum of `sb` and the corresponding element in `b`. Therefore, `preb[i]` is `sb + b[n-1]`.

The new value to be appended to `ptsb` is:
\[ \text{preb}[i] + \text{rem} \times \text{b}[i] = (sb + b[n-1]) + (k - n) \times b[n-1] \]
\[ = sb + b[n-1] + (k - n) \times b[n-1] \]
\[ = sb + k \times b[n-1] - n \times b[n-1] \]
\[ = sb + (k - n) \times b[n-1] \]

This value is appended to `ptsb`, so the updated `ptsb` will have this new element at the end.

Output State: **`preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is a list with at least one element, `sb` is `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1]`, `ss` is `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]`, `i` is `n-1`, `ptsb` is `[(sb + (k - n) * b[n-1])]`, `ptss` is `[]`, `rem` is `k - n`**
