Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `b` is a list containing one element `[(k - 1) * maxa]`; `s` is a list containing one element `[(k - 1) * maxa]`; `founds` is True; `foundb` is True; `i` is 0; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
