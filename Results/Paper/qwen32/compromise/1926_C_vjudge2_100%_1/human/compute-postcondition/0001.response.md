To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition in the loop head: `while num != 0:`.

The condition checks if `num` is not equal to 0. However, `num` is described as a list of integers, not a single integer. Therefore, the condition `num != 0` will always be `True` as long as `num` is a non-empty list, because a list is never equal to an integer 0.

Given this, the loop will execute as long as `num` is a non-empty list. Since the state provided indicates that the length of `num` is between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `num` is guaranteed to be a non-empty list.

Thus, no adjustments are needed to the state of `num` or `a` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the length of `num` is between 1 and 10^4, inclusive; `a` is 0**
