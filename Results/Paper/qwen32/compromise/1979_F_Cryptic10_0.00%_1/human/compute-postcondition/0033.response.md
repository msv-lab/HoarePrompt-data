To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet `v, u = func_1(d)` on the given initial state. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we can only infer that it returns two values which are assigned to `v` and `u`. The initial state specifies that `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`.

Since `func_1(d)` returns two values, `v` and `u`, we can assume that `v` might be reassigned to a new value, and `u` will be a new variable introduced with the value returned by `func_1`. The state of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged unless `v` is reassigned to a value that was not previously `v`, which could affect `remaining_vertices` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state can be described as follows:

- `v` is reassigned to the first value returned by `func_1(d)`.
- `u` is assigned the second value returned by `func_1(d)`.
- `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged unless `v` is reassigned to a value that was previously in `remaining_vertices`.

Since the exact values returned by `func_1(d)` are not specified, we cannot provide specific values for `v` and `u`. However, we can describe the state in terms of the changes made.

Output State: **`v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding the original `v` if `v` has been reassigned to a different value**.
