Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the single element `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` remains an empty list and `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to n inclusive. `d` is n - 1, and `v` is 0. `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`. No changes are made to `d`, `v`, or `u` beyond the initial conditions.**
