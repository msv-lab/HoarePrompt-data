To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables `path` and `remaining_vertices` evolve through each iteration.

### Initial State:
- `path` contains a single vertex `v`.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `d = n-1` down to `d = 0`.
- In each iteration, `func_1(d)` returns two values: `v` and `u`.
- The loop checks if `v` is `0`. If so, it skips the rest of the loop body for that iteration.
- If `v` is not `0` and is in `remaining_vertices`, it appends `v` to `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`, then breaks out of the loop.
- If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, it continues to the next iteration.

### Output State after Iterations:
- After the first iteration, if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` becomes `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` excludes `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains `[v]`.
- After the second iteration, if `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (which it wouldn't be if it was added in the first iteration), `path` would become `[v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` would exclude `v`. However, since `v` was already added in the first iteration, the loop would have broken, and this iteration would not occur.
- After the third iteration, similarly, if the loop continued, `v` would not be in `remaining_vertices` (assuming it was added in the first iteration), so the loop would break without adding another `v` to `path`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will break as soon as it finds a `v` in `remaining_vertices` and appends it to `path`, removing it from `remaining_vertices`. Since the loop iterates from `d = n-1` down to `d = 0`, the first successful iteration will be the final one.

### Final Output State:
- `path` will contain two vertices: the initial `v` and the first `v` found in `remaining_vertices` during the loop.
- `remaining_vertices` will exclude the `v` that was added to `path` during the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`.**
