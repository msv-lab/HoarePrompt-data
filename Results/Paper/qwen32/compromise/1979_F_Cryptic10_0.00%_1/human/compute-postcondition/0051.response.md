Output State: **`v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is a list containing three vertices `[v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v` (now removed). If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. `d` is 0. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged as described.**

In simpler terms: The values of `v` and `u` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The rest of the state, including `path`, `remaining_vertices`, and `d`, remains unchanged unless `v` was in `remaining_vertices` before, in which case `remaining_vertices` will no longer include `v`.
