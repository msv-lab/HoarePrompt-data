The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the code inside the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. As a result, the values of `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged from their previous state. The loop will execute the next iteration, and `d` will be updated to `x-1` where `x` is the value of `d` at the end of that next iteration. However, since we are only concerned with the current state after the `continue` statement, the values of `d`, `v`, and `u` remain as they were before the `continue`.

Output State: **`d` is `x-1` where `x` is the value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
