The code snippet `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the value `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. Since `v` is a specific value returned by `func_1(d)` and is added to `path`, the list `remaining_vertices` will no longer contain `v` after this operation. The values of `v`, `u`, `d`, and `path` remain unchanged except for the modification to `remaining_vertices`.

Output State: **`v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `d` is decremented by 1, `path` includes `v` at the end, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes `v`.**
