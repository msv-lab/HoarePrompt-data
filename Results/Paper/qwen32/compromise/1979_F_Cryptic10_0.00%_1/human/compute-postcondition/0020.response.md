Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is n - 2; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `path` is a list containing the element `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` remains an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n inclusive. `path` now contains `v` as its last element if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`. `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of `n`, `d`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices`. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is now removed from `remaining_vertices` and added to `path`. If `v` was 0, no changes were made to `path` or `remaining_vertices`. The loop or if statement is exited regardless.
