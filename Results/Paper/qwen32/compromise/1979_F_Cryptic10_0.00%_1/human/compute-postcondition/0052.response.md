Output State: **`v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is a list containing three vertices `[v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v` (now removed). If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. `d` is 0. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged as described.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the loop's code and proceeds to the next iteration, so the state described in the initial condition remains unchanged.
