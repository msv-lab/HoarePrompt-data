Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the single element `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` remains an empty list and `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to n inclusive. `d` is n - 1, and `v` is 0. `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`. No changes are made to `d`, `v`, or `u` beyond the initial conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is n - 2; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `path` is a list containing the element `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` remains an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n inclusive. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, `path` now contains `v` as its last element and `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v`. If `v` was not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains an empty list and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is n - 3; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged, meaning `path` is an empty list and `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to n inclusive. If `v` is not 0 and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains `v` at the end of the list, and `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the state remains unchanged, meaning `path` is an empty list and `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to n inclusive.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
