The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables; it merely alters the flow of the loop. Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, none of the variables `v`, `u`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, or `d` are affected.

Output State: **`v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(0)`, `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, or a list containing a single vertex `v` if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, or remains unchanged if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `d` is 0**.
