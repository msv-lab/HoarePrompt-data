Postcondition: **`v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. If `v` is 0, then `v` remains 0, `u` is unchanged, `path` still contains only `v`, and `remaining_vertices` remains the same.**
