The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, none of the variables will change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive; `d` is n - 1; `v` is 0; `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`**.
