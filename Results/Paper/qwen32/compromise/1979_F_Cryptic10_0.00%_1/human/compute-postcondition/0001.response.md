The code snippet creates a set called `remaining_vertices` that contains all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, with the condition 2 <= n <= 10^5. The variable `path` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive.**
