To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does with each test case and how it modifies the `result` list.

The loop processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
2. It calculates the space required for 1x1 icons (`space_x`) and 2x2 icons (`space_y`).
3. It calculates the total space required (`total_space`).
4. It calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`).
5. It calculates the remaining cells on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells`).
6. It checks if the remaining cells are sufficient for the 1x1 icons. If yes, it appends the number of screens required for 2x2 icons to the `result` list.
7. If the remaining cells are not sufficient, it calculates the extra space needed and the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons, then appends the total screens required to the `result` list.

The final `result` list will contain the number of screens required for each test case.

Let's assume we have the following input for `t=3`:
- Test case 1: `x=3`, `y=2`
- Test case 2: `x=10`, `y=1`
- Test case 3: `x=15`, `y=0`

Hereâ€™s how the loop will process these test cases:

1. **Test Case 1: `x=3`, `y=2`**
   - `space_x = 3 * 1 = 3`
   - `space_y = 2 * 4 = 8`
   - `total_space = 8 + 3 = 11`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 2 // 2 = 1`
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 8 = 7`
   - Since `space_x (3) <= remaining_cells (7)`, `result` becomes `[1]`.

2. **Test Case 2: `x=10`, `y=1`**
   - `space_x = 10 * 1 = 10`
   - `space_y = 1 * 4 = 4`
   - `total_space = 4 + 10 = 14`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`
   - Since `space_x (10) <= remaining_cells (11)`, `result` becomes `[1, 1]`.

3. **Test Case 3: `x=15`, `y=0`**
   - `space_x = 15 * 1 = 15`
   - `space_y = 0 * 4 = 0`
   - `total_space = 0 + 15 = 15`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 0 // 2 = 0`
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 0 - 0 = 0`
   - Since `space_x (15) > remaining_cells (0)`, `extra_space = 15 - 0 = 15`
   - `extra_screen = 15 // 15 = 1`
   - `result` becomes `[1, 1, 1]`.

Output State: **result = [1, 1, 1]**.

However, to generalize, the `result` list will contain the number of screens required for each test case, and the exact values in the list depend on the specific values of `x` and `y` for each test case.

Given the format requirement, the output state after all iterations is described as follows:
Output State: **result = [screens_required_for_each_test_case]**.
