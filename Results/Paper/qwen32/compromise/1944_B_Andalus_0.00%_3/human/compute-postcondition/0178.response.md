To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`sz`**: It is either 0 or 2.
2. **`rdb`**: A list containing elements from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]` that are equal to their preceding element.
3. **`T`**: Greater than 0.
4. **`n`**: The first integer from the input, and it must be greater than 1.
5. **`k`**: The second integer from the input.
6. **`lst`**: A list of integers obtained from the input.
7. **`lft`**: A sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`.
8. **`rgt`**: A sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end.
9. **`ldb`**: A list containing at least two elements.
10. **`sng`**: Contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position.
11. **`i`**: Set to `n-1`.
12. **`elem`**: The third element in `ldb`.
13. **Loop Condition**: If `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the execution continues; otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
14. **`sz` Adjustment**: If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is set to 2.

### Key Points:
- The `print` statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.
- This means it will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and no newline at the end.

### Variable `elem`:
- `elem` is the third element in `ldb`.
- Since `ldb` is a list containing at least two elements, it must have at least three elements for `elem` to be defined.

### Output:
Given that `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, the output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, separated by a space.

### Final Answer:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the third element in the list `ldb`)**
