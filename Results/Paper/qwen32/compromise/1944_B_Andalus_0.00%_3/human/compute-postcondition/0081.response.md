Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, n is greater than 1, k is the second integer from the input, a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, lst is a list of integers from the input, lft is a sorted list containing the first n elements of lst, rgt is a sorted list containing the elements of lst from index n to the end, ldb is an empty list (or contains elements that were not processed because sz reached k), sng contains the remaining elements in lft that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs after printing up to k elements, rdb contains all elements in rgt that appear twice consecutively, i is n, sz is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `sz` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
