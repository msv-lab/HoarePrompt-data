The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is 1 and `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, the element at index 1 of `lft` is the same as the element at index 0 of `lft`. Therefore, the element at index 0 of `lft` is appended to `ldb`.

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is a list containing the element at index 1 of `lft`, `sng` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`.**
