The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `lst`. 

Given the initial state, the variables `T`, `n`, and `k` retain their original values. The list `a` is also unchanged by this code snippet. The new variable `lst` is introduced and is assigned the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and `lst` is a list of integers from the input.**
