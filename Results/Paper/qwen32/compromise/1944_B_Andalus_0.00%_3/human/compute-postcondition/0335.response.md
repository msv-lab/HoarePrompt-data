Output State: **`sz` is either 0, 2, 4, or the value remains unchanged if it is already greater than or equal to `k`. `rdb` must contain at least two elements, and `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language: The value of `sz` remains as it was initially, being either 0, 2, 4, or unchanged if it was already greater than or equal to `k`. The list `rdb` still contains at least two elements, and `elem` is still the next element in `rdb`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
