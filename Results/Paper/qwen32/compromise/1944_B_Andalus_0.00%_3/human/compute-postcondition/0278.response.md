Let's analyze the loop and the provided states to determine the final output state after all iterations.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. In each iteration, it checks if the current element in `rgt` is equal to the previous element. If they are equal, it appends the current element to `rdb`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n-1`. After all iterations, `rdb` will contain all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates consecutively.

Here is the final output state:

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates; `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates consecutively; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates`; `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `rdb` will include all elements in `rgt` that are part of a consecutive duplicate sequence, and `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables (`sz`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `ldb`, and `sng`) remain unchanged from their initial states except for `rdb` and `i`.
