To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the context provided.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `T` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- `lst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst` with at least one pair of consecutive identical elements.
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index n to the end.
- `ldb` contains all elements that appear twice consecutively in `lft` and has at least one more element to be processed.
- `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs.
- `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively.
- `i` is `n`.
- The variable `sz` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it plays a role in a conditional check within the code snippet. However, the value of `sz` is not crucial for determining the output of the `print` statement.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```
This statement prints the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and does not end with a newline character.

### Determining the Value of `elem`:
The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, `elem` is likely to be an element from one of the lists `ldb`, `sng`, or `rdb` since these lists are mentioned in the initial state and are likely to be processed in the code.

Given the information, we can infer that `elem` is an element that appears in one of these lists. However, without the exact value of `elem`, we can only describe it in terms of what it represents.

### Output Description:
The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not end with a newline character.

### Final Output:
Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we describe it based on the possible sources it could come from.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from one of the lists ldb, sng, or rdb)**
