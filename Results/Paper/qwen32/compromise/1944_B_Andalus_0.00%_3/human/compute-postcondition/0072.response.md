To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(elem, end=' ')`, we need to understand the context and the value of `elem` based on the given initial state.

### Context Analysis
1. **Variables and Lists**:
   - `T`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 1.
   - `k`: The second integer from the input.
   - `a`: A list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
   - `lst`: A list of integers from the input.
   - `lft`: A sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt`: A sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
   - `ldb`: An empty list or contains elements that were not processed because `sz` reached `k`.
   - `sng`: Contains at least two elements that are in `lft` and are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs.
   - `rdb`: Contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively.
   - `i`: Set to `n`.
   - `sz`: The largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus one. If `sz` is equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - `print(elem, end=' ')`: This prints the value of `elem` followed by a space, without a newline.

### Value of `elem`
The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state. However, based on the context, it is likely that `elem` is a variable that is being iterated over in a loop or is being assigned a value within the code snippet that is not provided. Since the task is to determine what will be printed, and `elem` is not defined, we can infer that `elem` must be a variable that holds a value from one of the lists or is calculated based on the given conditions.

Given the information, `elem` could be any element from `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `rdb`, or any other list or calculation derived from the inputs. However, without the exact code snippet where `elem` is assigned a value, we can only describe `elem` in terms of its possible origins.

### Output Description
Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified, the most precise description we can provide is that `elem` is a variable that holds a value from one of the lists or is calculated based on the given conditions.

Output: **elem (where elem is a value from one of the lists or a calculated value based on the given conditions)**
