Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`, or exactly `k` if `k` is even, and all elements from `rdb` up to the point where `sz` becomes equal to or greater than `k` are printed in pairs.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sz` is incremented by 1; if `sz` was initially equal to `k` (and `k` is even), then `sz` is now `k + 1` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `sz` is now an odd number greater than the largest even number less than `k`; `rdb` and `sng` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is incremented by 1. If `sz` was initially equal to `k` (and `k` is even), then `sz` is now `k + 1` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` is now an odd number greater than the largest even number less than `k`. `rdb` and `sng` remain unchanged. `sng` must have at least one more element. `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is incremented by 1 again, `rdb` remains unchanged, `sng` remains unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is now greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
