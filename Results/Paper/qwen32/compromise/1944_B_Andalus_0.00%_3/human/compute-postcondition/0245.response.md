The code snippet initializes `rdb` as an empty list. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the new variable `rdb`.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` is an empty list; `rdb` is an empty list.**
