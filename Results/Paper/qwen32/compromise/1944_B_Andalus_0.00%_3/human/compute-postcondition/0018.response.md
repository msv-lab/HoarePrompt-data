Postcondition: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` contains `lft[i - 1]` as its last element, and `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` contains `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.**
