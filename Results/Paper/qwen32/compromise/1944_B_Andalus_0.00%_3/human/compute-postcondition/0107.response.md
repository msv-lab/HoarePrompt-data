To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the context in which the print statement is executed.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`sng`**: It must contain at least one element.
2. **`sz`**: This variable is set to `k` if `k` is achievable with the number of pairs in `rdb`. Otherwise, it is set to the largest even number less than or equal to `k`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, it remains unchanged.
3. **`rdb`**: This list is empty if all elements have been processed; otherwise, it contains the remaining elements.
4. **`elem`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a variable in the context where the print statement is executed.

### Contextual Analysis:
The print statement `print(elem, end=' ')` is executed with `end=' '`, which means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline. The variable `elem` is the element that will be printed.

### Determining the Value of `elem`:
Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `elem`, we must infer its value from the context. Typically, in such scenarios, `elem` would be an element from a list or an iterable that is being processed in a loop.

Given that `sng` must contain at least one element, and `rdb` could be a list of pairs or elements being processed, `elem` is likely to be an element from one of these lists. However, without more specific information about the loop or the context in which `elem` is assigned, we can only describe `elem` in general terms.

### Conclusion:
The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided in the initial state, we describe it as an element that is being processed in the context of the loop or the code snippet.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element being processed in the context of the loop or code snippet)**
