The code snippet sorts the list `lft`. This means the elements in `lft` will be rearranged in ascending order. The values of `sz`, `rdb`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `sng` remain unchanged. The only change is in the list `lft`, which is now sorted.

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.**
