The code snippet `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `rgt` to the list `rdb`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is `k + 2`.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` must be greater than `k + 2`; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates; `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and now also includes `rgt[k + 2]`; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates`; `i` is `k + 2`.**

In simpler terms, the element at index `k + 2` of `rgt` has been added to `rdb`. All other variables remain unchanged.
