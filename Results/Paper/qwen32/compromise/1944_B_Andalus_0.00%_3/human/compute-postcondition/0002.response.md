The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. This means the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input, while the initial state conditions for `T` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.**
