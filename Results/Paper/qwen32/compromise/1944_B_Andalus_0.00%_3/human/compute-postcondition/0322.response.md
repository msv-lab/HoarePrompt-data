Output State: **`sz` is 0, `rdb` must contain at least one element, and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `sz` and `rdb` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables.
