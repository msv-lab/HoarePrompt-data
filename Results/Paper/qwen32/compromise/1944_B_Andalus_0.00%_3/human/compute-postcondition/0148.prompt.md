Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` contains the element at index 1 of `lft`. Otherwise, `sng` contains `lft[i]` if `i` is greater than 0, less than `n - 1`, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `i` is `k + 1`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the element at index `i` of `lft`. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the element at index `i` of `lft` appended to it. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `i` is `k + 2`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `rdb` contains the element at index `i` of `lft`. Otherwise, `rdb` is an empty list. If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the element at index `i` of `lft` appended to it. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
