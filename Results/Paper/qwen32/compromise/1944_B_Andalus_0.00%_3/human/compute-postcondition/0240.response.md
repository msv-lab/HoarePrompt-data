The code provided reads two integers from the input, assigns the first to `n` and the second to `k`. This changes the values of `n` and `k` based on the input, while the variable `sz` and the state of the first `k` elements of `sng` being printed remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input.**
