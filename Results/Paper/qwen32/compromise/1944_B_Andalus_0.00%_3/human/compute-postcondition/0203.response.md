Output State: **`sz` is 0, `sng` is a list where the first `k` elements have been printed, `rdb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of `sz`, `sng`, and `rdb` remain unchanged. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
