Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer greater than 0, n is greater than 1, k is the second integer from the input, a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, lst is a list of integers from the input, lft is a sorted list containing the first n elements of lst, rgt is a sorted list containing the elements of lst from index n to the end, ldb contains all elements that appear twice consecutively in lft, sng contains all elements in lft that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs, rdb contains all elements in rgt that appear twice consecutively, i is n, sz is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst` with at least one pair of consecutive identical elements, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index n to the end, `ldb` contains all elements that appear twice consecutively in `lft`, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively, `i` is `n`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is its previous value plus 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst` with at least one pair of consecutive identical elements, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index n to the end, `ldb` contains all elements that appear twice consecutively in `lft` and has at least one more element to be processed, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively, `i` is `n`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst` with at least one pair of consecutive identical elements, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index n to the end, `ldb` contains all elements that appear twice consecutively in `lft` and has at least one more element to be processed, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively, `i` is `n`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz >= k`, then `sz` remains unchanged and the loop or statement is broken. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
