Let's break down the problem step by step based on the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis
1. **`sz` Calculation:**
   - `sz` is defined as the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 2.
   - For example, if `k` is 10, the largest even number less than or equal to 10 is 10 itself, so `sz` would be `10 + 2 = 12`.
   - If `k` is 9, the largest even number less than or equal to 9 is 8, so `sz` would be `8 + 2 = 10`.

2. **`sng` List:**
   - `sng` is a list with at least three elements.
   - For example, `sng` could be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

3. **`elem` Variable:**
   - `elem` is the third element of the `sng` list.
   - Using the example list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `elem` would be `3`.

4. **Conditional Break Statement:**
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - This condition does not affect the `print` statement directly, as the print statement is executed regardless of whether the condition is met or not.

### Code Execution
The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

- `elem` is the third element of the `sng` list.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of the default newline character.

### Output
Given the initial state, the `print` statement will output the third element of the `sng` list followed by a space.

### Final Answer
Output: **elem (where elem is the third element of the sng list) **
