To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the provided states step by step.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. During each iteration, it checks the elements of the sorted list `lft`:
- If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, it appends `lft[i]` to `ldb`.
- If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, it appends `lft[i]` to `sng`.

The initial state tells us that `sng` is initially empty, and `ldb` and `rdb` are also empty. The loop modifies `sng` and `ldb` based on the conditions mentioned above.

After the loop has completed all iterations:
- `ldb` will contain all elements in `lft` that have duplicates.
- `sng` will contain all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once, and these elements are not the first or last in a sequence of duplicates.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop continues to check each element of `lft` until `i` reaches `n - 1`.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations will be:
- `sz` remains `k`.
- The first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed.
- `n` and `k` remain the same as provided by the input.
- `lst` remains the same as provided by the input.
- `lft` remains a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- `rgt` remains a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`.
- `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates.
- `rdb` remains an empty list.
- `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates; `rdb` is an empty list; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates.**
