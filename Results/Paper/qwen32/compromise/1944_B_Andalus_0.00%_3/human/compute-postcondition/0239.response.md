The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used for iteration. The loop runs `T` times, and the loop body is omitted, meaning we don't have any information about how the loop modifies other variables.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `sz` is `k`, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration. Since the loop variable `_` doesn't affect `sz`, `k`, or `sng`, and there are no other variables in the loop head to adjust, the state of `sz`, `k`, and `sng` remains unchanged.

The only thing that changes is the loop variable `_`, which will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`sz` is `k`, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed**.
