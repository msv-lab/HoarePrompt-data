The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem` from the list `sng`. Since the loop iterates over each element in `sng`, at the start of the next iteration, `elem` should be the next element in the list. The other variables `sz`, `rdb`, and `sng` remain unchanged according to the problem statement.

Given that `sz` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration and the program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement, it implies that `sz` is still less than `k`. Therefore, the loop should continue to execute with `elem` being the next element in `sng`.

State: **`sz` is incremented by 1, `rdb` remains unchanged, `sng` remains unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `sng`**
