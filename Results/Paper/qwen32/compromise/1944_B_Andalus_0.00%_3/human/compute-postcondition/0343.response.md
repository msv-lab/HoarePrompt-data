The `break` statement in the given code snippet will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block that it is contained within, but it does not affect the values of the variables `sz`, `k`, `rdb`, or `sng`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`, or exactly `k` if `k` is even, and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. All elements from `rdb` up to the point where `sz` becomes equal to or greater than `k` are printed in pairs, `sng` must contain at least one element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
