The only object in the loop head of the provided for loop is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `T`, which represents the number of test cases. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value of `T`.

Since the loop will execute `T` times, `T` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute even once.

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.**
