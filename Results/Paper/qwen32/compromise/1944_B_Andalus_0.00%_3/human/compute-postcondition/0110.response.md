The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the most internal loop or if statement that it is contained within. It does not affect the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the values of `sng`, `elem`, `sz`, and `rdb` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is `sz + 1`, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
