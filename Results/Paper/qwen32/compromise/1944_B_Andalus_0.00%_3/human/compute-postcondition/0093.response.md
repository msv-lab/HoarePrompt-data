To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the precondition and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State Overview:**
   - `T` is an integer greater than 0 (though it's not used in the provided code snippet).
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
   - `lst` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end and must have at least one pair of consecutive identical elements.
   - `ldb` is an empty list or contains elements that were not processed because `sz` reached `k`.
   - `sng` contains the remaining elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs after printing up to `k` elements.
   - `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively and must have at least one element.
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.
   - If `sz < k` and `k - sz >= 2`, `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
   - `elem` is the next element in `rdb`.

2. **Understanding `elem`:**
   - `elem` is the next element in `rdb`, which contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively. Since `rgt` must have at least one pair of consecutive identical elements, `rdb` must contain at least one element.

3. **The Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.
   - This statement prints the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and does not move to a new line after printing (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since `elem` is an element from `rdb` and `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that appear twice consecutively, `elem` will be one of those elements.
   - The output will be `elem` printed twice, separated by a space.

Given these points, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from rdb, which contains elements from rgt that appear twice consecutively)**

This description ensures that the output is as precise as possible based on the provided precondition.
