To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the given conditions.

**Initial State:**
- `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`.
- The first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed.

**Loop Code:**
```python
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1
```

**Observations:**
- The loop iterates over each element in `sng`.
- The loop will print each element of `sng` until `sz` reaches `k`.
- `sz` starts as the largest even number less than or equal to `k` and increments by 1 for each iteration.
- The loop breaks if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times:**
- `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 3.
- `sng` is a list with at least three elements.
- The third element of `sng` has been printed.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks.

**Final Output State:**
- The loop will continue to print elements of `sng` until `sz` is no longer less than `k`.
- Therefore, the loop will print the first `k - (largest even number less than or equal to k)` elements of `sng` after the initial `sz` value.

Let's denote:
- `initial_sz` as the largest even number less than or equal to `k`.
- `final_sz` as the value of `sz` after the loop ends, which will be `k` or the point where the loop breaks.

**Final Output State:**
- `sz` will be `k` (or the point where the loop breaks, which is when `sz` reaches `k`).
- The loop will have printed the first `k - initial_sz` elements of `sng` after the initial `sz` value.

**Conclusion:**
- The loop will print the first `k` elements of `sng` because `sz` starts from the largest even number less than or equal to `k` and increments by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `k`.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed.**
