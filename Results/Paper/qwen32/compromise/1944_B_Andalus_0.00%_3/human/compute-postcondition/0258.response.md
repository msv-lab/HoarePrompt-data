The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given the initial state, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ldb` either contains `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, or it is an empty list otherwise.

Since `ldb.append(lft[i])` is executed, `ldb` will now include `lft[i]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains `lft[i]` (where `i` is `k + 1`); `sng` contains the first `k` elements of `lft` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`; `i` is `k + 1`.**
