The value of `sz` is reset to 0. The condition `sz` is equal to or greater than `k` is no longer guaranteed since `sz` has been explicitly set to 0. However, the precondition that all elements from `sng` up to the point where `sz` becomes equal to or greater than `k` are printed remains valid for the previous state. Now, `sz` is explicitly 0.

Output State: **`sz` is 0; all elements from `sng` up to the point where `sz` becomes equal to or greater than `k` are printed.**
