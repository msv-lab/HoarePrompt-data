Let's break down the given information and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `sz` is an integer that has been incremented by 1 and is still less than `k`.
- `k` is an integer.
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `sz` was not less than `k`. Otherwise, the loop or statement continues.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space, as specified by the `end=' '` parameter.
- From the initial state, we know that `elem` is the next element in the list `sng`.
- Since the loop or if statement continues (because `sz` is still less than `k`), `elem` is a valid element from the list `sng`.

### Output:
The output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can only describe it as the next element in the list `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the list `sng`)**
