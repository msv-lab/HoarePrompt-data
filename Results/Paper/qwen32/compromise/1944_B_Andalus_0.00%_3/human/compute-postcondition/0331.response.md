Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `sz` can be either 0 or 2.
- `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- `elem` is the next element in `rdb`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

Since `elem` is the next element in `rdb` and `rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` will be the first element of `rdb`. The print statement will print `elem` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end due to `end=' '`.

Let's denote the first element of `rdb` as `rdb[0]`. Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `rdb[0]` twice.

Output: **rdb[0] rdb[0] (where rdb[0] is the first element of the list `rdb`)**
