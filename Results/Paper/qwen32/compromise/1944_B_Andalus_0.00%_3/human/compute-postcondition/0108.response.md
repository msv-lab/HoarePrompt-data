The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sng` must contain at least one element, `sz` is now `sz + 1`, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. All other variables remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
