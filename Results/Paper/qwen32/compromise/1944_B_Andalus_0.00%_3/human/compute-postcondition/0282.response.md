Output State: **`sz` is 0, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates and must have at least 1 element; `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates consecutively; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates; `i` is `n-1`. Additionally, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values and states as described.
