The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given the initial state, the values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ldb` gains a new element, which is `lft[i]`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `i` is incremented by 1, `ldb` has an additional element `lft[i]` appended to it.**
