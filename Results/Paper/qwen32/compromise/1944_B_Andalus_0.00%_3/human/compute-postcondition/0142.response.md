Postcondition: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `i` is `k + 1`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the element at index `i` of `lft`. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the element at index `i` of `lft` appended to it. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.**
