You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then prints `k` integers from the list, ensuring that the printed integers are chosen such that if an integer appears twice in the list, it is printed twice if possible, and otherwise, it is printed once. The function ensures that exactly `k` integers are printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
You are given an array `a` of length `2n` where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice. You need to find two arrays `l` and `r` each of length `2k` such that:
- `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
- `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
- The bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is split into two halves: `lft` (first `n` elements) and `rgt` (last `n` elements).

3. **Identifying Elements:**
   - The program identifies elements that appear twice in `lft` and `rgt` and stores them in `ldb` and `rdb` respectively.
   - It also identifies elements in `lft` that appear only once and stores them in `sng`.

4. **Building the `l` and `r` Arrays:**
   - It attempts to build the arrays `l` and `r` by first adding pairs of elements that appear twice (`ldb` and `rdb`).
   - If there are still elements to add to reach the required length `2k`, it adds elements that appear only once (`sng`).

### Issues in the Program:
The program has a few issues:
- **Handling of `sng` Elements:**
  - The program adds elements from `sng` to both `l` and `r` without ensuring that the XOR of `l` and `r` will be the same.
  - This can lead to incorrect solutions because the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` may not match if different elements are added from `sng`.

- **Subset Constraint:**
  - The program does not ensure that the elements added to `l` are a subset of the first `n` elements and the elements added to `r` are a subset of the last `n` elements.
  - However, the current approach does maintain this constraint, but the XOR condition may not be satisfied.

- **Inefficiency:**
  - The program sorts `lft` and `rgt` which is unnecessary and may lead to inefficiency.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not guarantee that the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` will be equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
