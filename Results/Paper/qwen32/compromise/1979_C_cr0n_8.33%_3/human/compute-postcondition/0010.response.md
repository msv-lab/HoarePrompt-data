Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `N` is an integer read from the input. `vals` is a list of integers read from the input. `prod` is the product of all integers in `vals`. `vprod` is a list where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0.**
