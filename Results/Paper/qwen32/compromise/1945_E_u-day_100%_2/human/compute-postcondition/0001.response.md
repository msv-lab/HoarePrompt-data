The code snippet `arr = func_2()` updates the value of `arr`, replacing its previous value with whatever `func_2()` returns. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `arr` and retains the original state of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`**.
