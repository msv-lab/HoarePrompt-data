To determine the output of the `print(2 ** power)` statement, we need to understand the value of the variable `power` based on the given initial state.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `n`**:
   - `n` is an input integer. Its exact value is not specified, but it can be any integer.

2. **Understanding `power`**:
   - `power` is defined as `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`.
   - `log2(n)` computes the base-2 logarithm of `n`.
   - `ceil(log2(n))` rounds the result of `log2(n)` up to the nearest integer.
   - Subtracting 1 from `ceil(log2(n))` gives us the value of `power`.

3. **Interpreting `power`**:
   - `power` is the highest integer `k` such that \(2^k \leq n\).
   - Since `power` is not equal to `n`, it means `n` is not a power of 2.

4. **Calculating `2 ** power`**:
   - `2 ** power` will be the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example where `n = 10`:
- `log2(10)` is approximately `3.3219`.
- `ceil(log2(10))` is `4`.
- `power` is `4 - 1 = 3`.
- `2 ** power` is `2 ** 3 = 8`.

### General Case:
For any given integer `n`, `2 ** power` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.

### Output:
The code prints `2 ** power`, which is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the input integer `n`.

Output: **2 ** power (where power is the highest integer k such that 2^k <= n)**
