The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n_cases`. If `i` is less than `n_cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be 1 and `n_cases` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

The states of `n`, `power`, and any other variables derived from them (like `ceil(log2(n))`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
