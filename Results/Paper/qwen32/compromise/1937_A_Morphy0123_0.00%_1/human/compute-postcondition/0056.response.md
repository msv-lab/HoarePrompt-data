Postcondition: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `power` is determined as follows: If `n` is 1, `power` remains unchanged. If `n` is not equal to 1, `power` is set to 3 if `power` is not already equal to `n` (where `16 <= n < 32`); otherwise, `power` remains equal to `n`. If `n` is not 1 and does not meet the condition for setting `power` to 3, then `power` is `ceil(log2(n))` if `power` equals `n`; otherwise, `power` is `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`.**
