The code snippet provided only reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. It does not perform any operations on the array `a` or any other variables yet. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of the input value to `n_cases`. The other conditions and variables remain as initially described.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4), for each test case, `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9) is the length of the array `a` where initially `a_i = i` for each 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`.**
