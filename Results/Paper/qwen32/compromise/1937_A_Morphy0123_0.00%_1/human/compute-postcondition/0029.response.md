To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop condition: `power` and `n`.

The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`. Given the current state:
- `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1 (though this is not relevant to the loop condition).
- `i` is 1 (also not relevant to the loop condition).
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `power` is 3.

For the loop to execute again, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`. Since `power` is currently 3, we need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 3. This implies that `n` must be greater than \(2^3 = 8\).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is greater than 8.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 3**
