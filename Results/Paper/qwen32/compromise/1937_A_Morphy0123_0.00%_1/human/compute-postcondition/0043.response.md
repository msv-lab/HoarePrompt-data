To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `power < log2(n)`.

### Analysis:
- **`power`**: This variable is currently set to 1.
- **`log2(n)`**: This represents the base-2 logarithm of `n`. The value of `log2(n)` depends on the input integer `n`.

### Condition for the Loop to Execute:
The loop will execute if `power < log2(n)`. Given that `power` is 1, for the loop to execute, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1.

### Determining the Value of `n`:
- `log2(n) > 1` implies that `n` must be greater than 2. The smallest integer `n` that satisfies this condition is 3.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 2. Since `power` is already 1, no changes are needed for `power`.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `power` is 1**
