The variables in the loop head are `power` and `log2(n)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the comparison `power < log2(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`. Since `power` is currently 2, `log2(n)` must be greater than 2. This means `n` must be greater than \(2^2 = 4\).

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 4, `power` is 2**
