The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `flag` to `True`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the old `x`, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the input. The element at index `l[i] - 1` in `l` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, `flag` is True.**
