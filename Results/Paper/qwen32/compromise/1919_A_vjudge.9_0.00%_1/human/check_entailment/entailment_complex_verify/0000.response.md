### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight of the problem: the parity of the total number of coins (a + b) determines the winner. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is based on the optimal strategy where players can always force the other player into a losing position by maintaining the parity of the number of coins.

The provided code accurately implements this logic in the `func_1` function, which checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and returns 'Bob' or 'Alice' accordingly. The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input, calling `func_1` for each test case, and printing the results.

The annotations in the annotated version of the code confirm that the logic is correctly implemented and that the states of the variables are as expected. The annotations describe the function's behavior and the state of the program at key points, which align with the intended logic.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins and handles multiple test cases as required by the problem description.

**Final: True**
