### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins they each have in their wallets. The key to solving the problem is to realize that the game can be analyzed based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (a + b).

Here is the reasoning broken down:

- **Game Analysis:**
  - Each player can either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet.
  - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, i.e., when both wallets are empty.
  - If the total number of coins (a + b) is **even**, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves, ensuring that Bob wins.
  - If the total number of coins (a + b) is **odd**, the first player (Alice) can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins, ensuring that Alice wins.

- **Function Analysis:**
  - `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', and if the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
  - `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins Alice and Bob have, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and then prints the result.

Since both functions together correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the problem description, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
