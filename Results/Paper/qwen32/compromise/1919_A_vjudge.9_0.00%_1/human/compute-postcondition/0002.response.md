The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `a`, `b`, and `results` do not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The state of `a`, `b`, and `results` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `results` is an empty list**
