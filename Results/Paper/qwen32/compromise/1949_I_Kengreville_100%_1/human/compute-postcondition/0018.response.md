Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but operates on the following global variables: `n` (an integer between 1 and 1000), `x` and `y` (lists of integers where each element is between -10^9 and 10^9), `r` (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9), `visited` (a list of boolean values initialized to False), and `coef` (a list of None values used to store coefficients during a DFS traversal). The function performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal using these variables and modifies the `visited` and `coef` lists accordingly. The function does not return any value explicitly.**
