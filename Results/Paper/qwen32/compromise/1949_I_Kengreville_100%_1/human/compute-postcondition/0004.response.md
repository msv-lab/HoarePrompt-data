The code snippet provided initializes the `visited` list to a list of `n` boolean values, all set to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, and `coef`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Given that `visited` was previously a list of boolean values initialized to `False`, this line of code essentially reinitializes `visited` to the same state. Therefore, the `visited` list remains a list of `n` `False` values.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `x` is a list of `n` None values, `y` is a list of `n` None values, `r` is a list of `n` None values, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, and `coef` is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.**
