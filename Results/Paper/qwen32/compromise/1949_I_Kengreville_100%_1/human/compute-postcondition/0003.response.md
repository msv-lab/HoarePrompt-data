The code snippet `r = [None] * n` changes the list `r` to a new list containing `n` `None` values. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `x` is a list of `n` None values, `y` is a list of `n` None values, `r` is a list of `n` None values, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False, and `coef` is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.**
