### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **String Processing**: For each test case, it reads a string `a` of length 5.
3. **Counting Characters**: It initializes two counters, `l` and `h`, to zero. These counters are used to count occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively.
4. **Character Counting Loop**: It iterates through each character in the string `a`. If the character is 'A', it increments `l`; otherwise, it increments `h`.
5. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, it compares the values of `l` and `h`. If `l` is greater than `h`, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.

### Analysis:

- The logic for counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' is correct.
- The comparison to determine which character appears more frequently is also correct.
- The program handles all possible inputs as per the problem description (strings of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B').

### Edge Cases Considered:

- All 'A's: "AAAAA" should return 'A'.
- All 'B's: "BBBBB" should return 'B'.
- Mixed strings where 'A' and 'B' appear equally (e.g., "ABABB") should return 'B' according to the program's logic, which matches the problem statement's expected output.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine which letter ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each test case string. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
