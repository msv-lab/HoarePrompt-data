The value of `h` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `h` was either 0 or 2. After incrementing, `h` will be either 1 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `j` is the third character of `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 1. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 3.**
