The value of `h` is incremented by 1. Initially, `h` is either 0 (if `j` is 'A') or 1 (if `j` is not 'A'). After incrementing, `h` will be 1 (if it was initially 0) or 2 (if it was initially 1). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 0; `a` is a non-empty string with at least two characters; `j` is the third character of `a`; if `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 1. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 2.**
