The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, which iterates over the string `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to the next character in the string `a` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is a non-empty string with at least two characters.
- `j` is the second character of `a`.
- If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1.

Since `j` is currently the second character of `a`, for the next iteration, `j` should be the third character of `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 0; `a` is a non-empty string with at least two characters; `j` is the third character of `a`; if `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1.**
