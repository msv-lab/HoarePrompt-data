The value of `h` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `h` was either 0 or 1. After the increment, `h` will be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 2; `a` is a non-empty string; `j` is the next character in the string `a`; if `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 1; otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 2.**
