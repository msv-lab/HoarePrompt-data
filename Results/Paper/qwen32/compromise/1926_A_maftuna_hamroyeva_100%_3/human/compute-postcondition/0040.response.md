The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `j` is 'A', `l` was initially 2 and now becomes 3. If `j` is not 'A', `l` was initially 0 and now becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `j` is the third character of `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 3 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 1 and `h` is 2.**
