t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t test cases consists of three lines: the first line is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, the second line is a string s of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1', and the third line is a string f of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
