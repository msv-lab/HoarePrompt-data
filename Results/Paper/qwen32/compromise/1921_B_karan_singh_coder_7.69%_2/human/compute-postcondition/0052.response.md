The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the characters at index `i` in `s` and `t` are not equal. Given that `i` is 2, `cnt` will be incremented by 1 if `s[2]` is not equal to `t[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the new string input by the user, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 0), `s` is the new string input by the user, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus 1 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]` plus 1 if `s[2]` is not equal to `t[2]`, `i` is 2**.
