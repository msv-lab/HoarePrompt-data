The code snippet resets the value of `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the new string input by the user; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the new string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`; `cnt` is 0; `i` is `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, no additional variable `d` is defined. Otherwise, `d` is defined as the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
