The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '1's in the strings `s` and `t`, and assigns this value to the variable `d`. The values of `s1` and `t1` remain unchanged as they are the counts of '1's in `s` and `t` respectively. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the new string input by the user, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 0), `s` is the new string input by the user, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `s1` is not equal to `t1`, `d` is `abs(s1 - t1)`**.
