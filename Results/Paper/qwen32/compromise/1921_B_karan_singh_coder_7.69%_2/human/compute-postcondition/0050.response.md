The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` compares the characters at index `i` of strings `s` and `t`. If they are not equal, it adds 1 to `cnt`. Given that `i` is 1, the comparison is between `s[1]` and `t[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is the new string input by the user, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 0), `s` is the new string input by the user, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus 1 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, `i` is 1**

In natural language: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the characters at index 1 of `s` and `t` are not equal. All other variables remain unchanged.
