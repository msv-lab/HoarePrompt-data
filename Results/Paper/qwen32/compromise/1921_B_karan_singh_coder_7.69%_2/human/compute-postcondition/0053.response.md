Output State: **`t` is the new string input by the user, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 0), `s` is the new string input by the user, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes all its iterations, `cnt` will hold the total number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `s1`, `t1`, and `i` will remain as initially defined or updated by the loop's logic, with `i` specifically being `n-1` at the end of the loop.
