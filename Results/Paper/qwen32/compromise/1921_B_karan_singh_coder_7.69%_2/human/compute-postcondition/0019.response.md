Postcondition: **`t` is a string input by the user; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`; `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ; `i` is `n-1`. If the count of '1's in `s` is equal to the count of '1's in `t`, no additional variable `d` is defined. Otherwise, `d` is defined as the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
