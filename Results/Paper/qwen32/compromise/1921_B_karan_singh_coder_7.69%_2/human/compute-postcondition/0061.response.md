Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two strings `s` and `f` of the same length `n`, where `n` is an integer and both strings consist only of '0' and '1'. The function returns a result for each test case based on the comparison of strings `s` and `f`.**
