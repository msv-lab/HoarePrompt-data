You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

    #State: the output of the last test case processed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `s` and `t` of the same length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the number of differing positions between the two strings and the count of '1's in each string. Specifically, if the number of '1's in both strings is the same, it prints the number of differing positions if there are any, or 0 if the strings are identical. If the number of '1's differs, it calculates and prints a value that accounts for the necessary changes to make the strings identical in terms of both differing positions and '1' counts.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to transform the initial state of the boxes (represented by a string `s`) into a desired state (represented by a string `f`). The operations allowed are:
1. Adding a cat to an empty box.
2. Removing a cat from a box.
3. Moving a cat from one box to another.

The objective is to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve the desired state.

### Key Observations:
- The number of cats in the initial state (`s.count('1')`) and the desired state (`f.count('1')`) are important. If these counts are different, the difference will determine the number of cats that need to be added or removed.
- The number of mismatched positions (`cnt`), i.e., positions where `s[i] != f[i]`, indicates how many cats need to be moved or added/removed.

### Solution Analysis:
1. **Count the Cats**: The code correctly counts the number of cats in the initial state (`s1 = s.count('1')`) and the desired state (`t1 = t.count('1')`).
2. **Count Mismatches**: The code correctly counts the number of mismatched positions (`cnt = 0` for `i in range(n)` where `cnt += s[i] != t[i]`).
3. **Calculate Operations**:
   - If the number of cats in the initial state equals the number of cats in the desired state (`s1 == t1`), the number of operations required is simply half of the mismatches (`cnt // 2`), because each mismatch can be resolved by moving a cat from one box to another. However, if there are no mismatches (`cnt == 0`), no operations are needed.
   - If the number of cats in the initial state does not equal the number of cats in the desired state (`s1 != t1`), the difference (`d = abs(s1 - t1)`) represents the number of cats that need to be added or removed. The total number of operations is calculated as `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`:
     - `(cnt - d) // 2` accounts for the mismatches that can be resolved by moving cats.
     - `d` accounts for the additional operations needed to add or remove cats.

### Verification with Examples:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - `s = "10010"`, `f = "00001"`
   - `s1 = 2`, `t1 = 1`, `cnt = 4`
   - `d = abs(2 - 1) = 1`
   - Operations = `(4 - 1) // 2 + 1 = 2`
2. **Second Test Case**:
   - `s = "1"`, `f = "1"`
   - `s1 = 1`, `t1 = 1`, `cnt = 0`
   - Operations = `0`
3. **Third Test Case**:
   - `s = "000"`, `f = "111"`
   - `s1 = 0`, `t1 = 3`, `cnt = 6`
   - `d = abs(0 - 3) = 3`
   - Operations = `(6 - 3) // 2 + 3 = 3`
4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - `s = "0101"`, `f = "1010"`
   - `s1 = 2`, `t1 = 2`, `cnt = 4`
   - Operations = `4 // 2 = 2`
5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - `s = "100"`, `f = "101"`
   - `s1 = 1`, `t1 = 2`, `cnt = 2`
   - `d = abs(1 - 2) = 1`
   - Operations = `(2 - 1) // 2 + 1 = 1`
6. **Sixth Test Case**:
   - `s = "10011001"`, `f = "11111110"`
   - `s1 = 4`, `t1 = 7`, `cnt = 8`
   - `d = abs(4 - 7) = 3`
   - Operations = `(8 - 3) // 2 + 3 = 4`

### Conclusion:
The solution correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required for each test case based on the given problem constraints.
