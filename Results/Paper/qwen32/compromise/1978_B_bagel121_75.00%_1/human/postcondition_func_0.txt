The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the printed value is `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the maximum possible sequence of `k` numbers ending at `b` and the remaining numbers multiplied by `a`, then prints this sum.
