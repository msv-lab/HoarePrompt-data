### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the program code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Analysis

Bob aims to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`, and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

#### Key Observations

1. **Base Case**: If `a >= b`, it's better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price won't yield more profit.
2. **Choosing `k`**: When `a < b`, we need to determine the optimal `k` that maximizes the total profit. The maximum possible value of `k` is `min(b - a + 1, n)` because the price cannot go below 1.

#### Calculating Profit

For a given `k`:
- The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1)`. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `k * (2*b - k + 1) / 2`.
- The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

#### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)
```

- **Base Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the base case where `a >= b` by selling all buns at the usual price `a`.
- **Choosing `k`**: The program calculates the maximum possible `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`, which is correct.
- **Profit Calculation**:
  - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the arithmetic series sum formula: `k * (2*b - k + 1) / 2`. This formula is correct.
  - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`, which is also correct.
  - The total profit is then the sum of these two parts: `ans + p2`.

#### Function Summary

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program:
- It processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- For each test case, it calculates and prints a value.
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the printed value is `n * a`.
- Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the maximum possible sequence of `k` numbers ending at `b` and the remaining numbers multiplied by `a`, then prints this sum.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions. The function summary and the original assessment both confirm the correctness of the program.

**Correctness: True**

Final: **True**
