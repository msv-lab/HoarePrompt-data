### Reasoning:
The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b` for the first bun, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` to maximize profit. This is because selling at `a` will yield at least as much as selling at `b` (and possibly more, if `a` is greater than `b`).
   - If `a` is less than `b`, Bob should sell the first `k` buns at the modified price, where `k` is the maximum number of buns he can sell at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`. The value of `k` is constrained by the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n` (the total number of buns).

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - If `a >= b`, the profit is simply `n * a`.
   - If `a < b`, the profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\). This formula calculates the sum of the series `b, (b-1), (b-2), ..., (b-k+1)`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

4. **Printing Results:**
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

The logic and implementation in the program correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The program efficiently calculates the maximum profit for each test case by considering the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price.
