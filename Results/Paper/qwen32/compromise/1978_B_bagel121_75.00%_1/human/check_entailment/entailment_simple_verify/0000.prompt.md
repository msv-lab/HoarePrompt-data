You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob has `n` buns to sell. The usual price of a bun is `a` coins. For a promotional offer, he can choose an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)) and sell the first `k` buns at a modified price where the price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins. The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each. The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the maximum profit by determining the optimal `k` and computing the total profit.

Here's the provided code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)
```

### Correctness Verification:
1. **Case 1: `a >= b`**
   - If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the promotional price `b`, Bob should not use the promotional price because it would not increase his profit. Therefore, he sells all `n` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The code correctly handles this case by printing `n * a`.

2. **Case 2: `a < b`**
   - If the usual price `a` is less than the promotional price `b`, Bob should use the promotional price for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining `(n - k)` buns.
   - The code calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and does not exceed the number of distinct promotional prices available (`b - a + 1`).
   - The promotional profit is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - The remaining profit is calculated as `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of the promotional profit and the remaining profit: `ans + p2`.

### Edge Cases:
- **`n = 1`**: When there is only one bun, the program correctly handles it by choosing `k = 1` if `a < b` or `k = 0` if `a >= b`.
- **`b = a`**: When the promotional price is equal to the usual price, the program correctly chooses `k = 0` and sells all buns at the usual price.
- **`b < a`**: When the promotional price is less than the usual price, the program correctly chooses `k = 0` and sells all buns at the usual price.
- **`k = n`**: When the number of buns `n` is less than or equal to the number of distinct promotional prices (`b - a + 1`), the program correctly calculates the maximum profit by selling all buns at the promotional price.
- **`k < n`**: When the number of buns `n` is greater than the number of distinct promotional prices (`b - a + 1`), the program correctly calculates the maximum profit by selling the first `k` buns at the promotional price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent issues or cases where the program fails to produce the expected result.

**Correctness: True**.
