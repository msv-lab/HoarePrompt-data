Let's analyze the code step-by-step to understand the output state.

The initial state is given as:
- `a`: A list of integers where each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times.
- `count_a`: A dictionary where keys are unique integers from `a` and values are the counts of these integers in `a`.
- `max_score`: Initially set to 0.

The loop iterates over each number `num` from 1 to `n`. For each `num`, it checks if `num` is in the dictionary `count_a`. If `num` is in `count_a` and its count is exactly 2, it increments `max_score` by 1.

The purpose of this loop is to count how many unique integers in the list `a` appear exactly twice. This count is stored in `max_score`.

After the loop completes, the state of `a` and `count_a` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify these variables. The only variable that gets modified is `max_score`.

So, the output state will be:
- `a`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `count_a`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `max_score`: Reflects the number of unique integers in `a` that appear exactly twice.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `max_score` is the number of unique integers in `a` that appear exactly twice.**
