### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to verify its correctness against the problem description.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to determine the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree results in all remaining components having at least \( x \) vertices.

#### Program Explanation and Annotations:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The tree is represented using a class `Tree` which contains vertices. Each vertex has children and additional attributes like `good_components` and `remaining_size`.
   - Annotations confirm that the tree is correctly constructed from the input edges.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function performs a postorder traversal of the tree starting from vertex `s`.
   - It calculates the number of good components (components with size \(\geq x\)) and the remaining size for each subtree.
   - It uses a stack to avoid recursion and handles postorder traversal manually.
   - Annotations show that the stack is correctly managed, and the attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size` are updated correctly for each vertex.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Similar to `func_1`, but implemented recursively.
   - It also calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
   - Annotations confirm the correct recursive calculation of `good_components` and `remaining_size`.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function checks if it's possible to have at least \( k \) good components with each having at least \( x \) vertices.
   - It uses `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size of the root.
   - Annotations confirm that the function correctly checks the conditions for `good_components` and `remaining_size`.

5. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition in `func_3`.
   - It sets the initial range from 1 to \( n \) and iteratively narrows down the range based on the result of `func_3`.
   - Annotations show that the binary search correctly narrows down the range and finds the maximum \( x \).

6. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This is the main function that reads input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \).
   - Annotations confirm that the tree is correctly constructed, rooted, and the maximum \( x \) is printed.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- **Tree Construction**: The tree is correctly constructed from the input edges.
- **Postorder Traversal**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly perform postorder traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size.
- **Binary Search**: `func_4` correctly uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like when \( k \) is 1 or when the tree is a straight line.

#### Conclusion:
The annotations confirm that the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It efficiently constructs the tree, performs necessary calculations, and uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) as required.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
