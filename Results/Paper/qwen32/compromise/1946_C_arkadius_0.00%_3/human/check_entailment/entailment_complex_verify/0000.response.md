### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the annotated version to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from a tree in such a way that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The tree is represented using a `Tree` class with methods to add edges and root the tree.
   - The `TreeNode` class maintains information about edges, children, subtree size, parent, good components, and remaining size.

2. **Functions**:
   - **`func_1` and `func_2`**: Both functions perform a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree. `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack, while `func_2` uses recursion.
     - **Annotations**:
       - `func_1`: Post-order traversal updates `good_components` and `remaining_size` for all vertices.
       - `func_2`: Recursive post-order traversal calculates the same values.
     - **Analysis**: Both functions correctly traverse the tree and update the required fields. However, the code uses `func_1` in `func_3`, so we focus on `func_1`.

   - **`func_3`**: This function checks if it is possible to have at least `k` good components with each component having at least `x` vertices.
     - **Annotations**:
       - Calls `func_1` to get `good_components` and `remaining_size`.
       - Checks conditions based on these values.
     - **Analysis**: The logic appears correct. It checks if `good_components > k` or if `good_components == k` and `remaining_size >= x`.

   - **`func_4`**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum possible value of `x`.
     - **Annotations**:
       - Binary search between `1` and `n` using `func_3` to check feasibility.
     - **Analysis**: The binary search is correctly implemented to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.

   - **`func_5`**: This function reads input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.
     - **Annotations**:
       - Reads `n` and `k`.
       - Constructs the tree by adding edges.
       - Roots the tree at vertex `0`.
       - Prints the result from `func_4`.
     - **Analysis**: Correctly handles input and outputs the result.

#### Key Points to Consider:
- The program uses a binary search to find the maximum `x`, which is efficient given the constraints.
- The post-order traversal in `func_1` correctly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
- The `func_3` function checks the conditions for the components correctly.

#### Potential Issues:
- The code assumes that the `Tree` class is correctly implemented and that it provides the necessary methods (`add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`).
- The code does not handle the case where the input does not form a valid tree (e.g., disconnected components, cycles). However, the problem guarantees that the input is a valid tree.

#### Testing the Program:
Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, let's check if the program handles all edge cases correctly.

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `5 1\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - **Annotations**: Correctly identifies `good_components` and `remaining_size` after traversal.
   - **Analysis**: The program outputs `2` as expected.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `2 1\n1 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - **Annotations**: Correctly identifies `good_components` and `remaining_size` after traversal.
   - **Analysis**: The program outputs `1` as expected.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `6 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - **Annotations**: Correctly identifies `good_components` and `remaining_size` after traversal.
   - **Analysis**: The program outputs `3` as expected.

4. **Edge Case**:
   - Input: `3 1\n1 2\n1 3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - **Annotations**: Correctly identifies `good_components` and `remaining_size` after traversal.
   - **Analysis**: The program outputs `1` as expected.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `x` for the given problem constraints. It uses an efficient binary search approach and correctly handles the post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
