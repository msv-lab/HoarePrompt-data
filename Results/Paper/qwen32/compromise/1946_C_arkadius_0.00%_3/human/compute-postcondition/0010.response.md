The code snippet `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree` object. Given that `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, the values of `u` and `v` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is also unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

The `tree` object is modified by adding the new edge, but the specific structure of the tree (other than the addition of this edge) remains as per the initial state. The values of `n` and `k` are also unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices and includes an additional edge between vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1`, `u` and `v` are the two new integers read from the input, `i` is 3. The `tree` now has an additional edge between vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1`.**
