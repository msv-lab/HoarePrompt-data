Functionality: **The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `tree`, which is an object representing a tree with `n` vertices, and an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n. The function returns the largest integer for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True, where this integer is equal to both `beg` and `end`.**
