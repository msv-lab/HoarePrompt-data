The code snippet provided sets the variable `beg` to the value of `mid`. Given the initial state, `mid` is calculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. After the assignment, `beg` will now hold the value of `mid`.

Output State: **`tree` is an object representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `beg` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, `end` must be greater than `beg`, `mid` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`.**

In natural language: After executing the code, `beg` is updated to the value of `mid`, which is calculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
