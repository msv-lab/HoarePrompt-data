Output State: **`v` is the vertex that was last pushed onto the stack, `postorder` is the boolean value that was the second part of the last tuple on the stack, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class where `tree.vertices[v].children` contains at least one more child, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `stack` contains the remaining tuples after the last tuple has been popped plus the new tuple `(v, True)` and the new tuple `(u, False)`, `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`**

The code appends a new tuple `(u, False)` to the `stack`. The values of `v`, `postorder`, `tree`, `s`, `x`, and `u` remain unchanged. The `stack` now includes the tuple `(v, True)` and the newly added tuple `(u, False)`.
