Output State: **`v` is a vertex in `tree` that has at least one child, `postorder` is `True`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `stack` contains the remaining tuples after the last tuple has been popped, and `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children` that has not yet been processed. The value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial states.
