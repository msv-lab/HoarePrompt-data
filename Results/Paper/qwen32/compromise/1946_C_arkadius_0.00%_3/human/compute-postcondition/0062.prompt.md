Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `v` is the vertex that was last pushed onto the stack, `postorder` is the boolean value that was the second part of the last tuple on the stack and is currently `True`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `stack` contains the remaining tuples after the last tuple has been popped.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `v` is a vertex in `tree` that has at least one child, `postorder` is `True`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `stack` contains the remaining tuples after the last tuple has been popped. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `v` is a vertex in `tree` that has at least one child, `postorder` is `True`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `stack` contains the remaining tuples after the last tuple has been popped, and `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `v` is a vertex in `tree` that has at least one child, `postorder` is `True`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `stack` contains the remaining tuples after the last tuple has been popped, and `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children` that has not yet been processed. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1`. Otherwise, the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components` and the value of `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is now `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
