The code snippet pops the last tuple from the `stack` and assigns the first element of the tuple to `v` and the second element to `postorder`. Therefore, the values of `v` and `postorder` will be updated to the values of the elements in the popped tuple. The `stack` will have one less tuple after this operation.

Output State: **`v` is the first element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `stack` has one less tuple than before.**
