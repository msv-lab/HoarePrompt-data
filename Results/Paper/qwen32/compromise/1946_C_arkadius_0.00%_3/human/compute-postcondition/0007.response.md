The code snippet `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree` object. Given that `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, the edge is added between the vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `u`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged by the execution of this code snippet. Only the `tree` object is modified by the addition of the new edge.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices and includes an additional edge between vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1`, `u` and `v` are the two new integers read from the input, `i` is 2.**
