Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `tree`, which is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children; `v`, an integer representing the current vertex; and `x`, an integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. The function returns `good_components`, which is the total count of good components accumulated from all iterations, and `remaining_size`, which is the final remaining size after all iterations.**
