Postcondition: **`tree` is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `postorder` is `False`. If `postorder` is `False`, then `stack` is a list containing the tuple `(v, True)` and all tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list. Otherwise, `stack` remains an empty list. Since `postorder` is `False` in this case, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` are not updated in this block.**
