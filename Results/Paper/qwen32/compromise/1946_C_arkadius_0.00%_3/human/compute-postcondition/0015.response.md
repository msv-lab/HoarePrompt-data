Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of vertices and an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed from a tree. It constructs a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges based on the input, roots the tree at vertex 0, and then calculates and prints the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges.**
