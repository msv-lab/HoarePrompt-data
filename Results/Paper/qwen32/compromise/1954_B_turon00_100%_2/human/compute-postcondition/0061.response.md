The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of elements equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
