To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are directly involved in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than `i_new`.
- `i` is `i_new`.
- If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is increased by 1.
- Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and 0, and `cnt` is reset to 0.

The loop is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since the loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`), and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore:
- `i` should be `i_new + 1`.
- `n` must still be greater than `i_new + 1`.

The other variables (`a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i_new + 1`, `i` is `i_new + 1`**
