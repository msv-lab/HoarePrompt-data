The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable that does not affect the state of the other variables in the program. The loop will execute as long as the range `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is not used in the loop body, we only need to ensure that `t` is decremented properly for the next iteration.

Given that `t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0 if the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp` has ended or the length of the last sequence if it hasn't, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` equals 1 or `ans` equals `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
