The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The variables `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. Since `t` is already defined as being in the range 1 to 10^4, it inherently meets this condition. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` and `a` remain as described in the initial state for each test case**
