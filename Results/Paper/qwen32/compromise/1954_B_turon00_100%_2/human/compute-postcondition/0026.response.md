Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0 if the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp` has ended or the length of the last sequence if it hasn't, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` equals 1 or `ans` equals `n`.**
