The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. The values of `n`, `i_new`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i_new`, `i` is `i_new`, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`**.
