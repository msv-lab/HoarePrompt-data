The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**
