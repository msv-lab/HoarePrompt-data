The code snippet provided increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially set to 1 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` (otherwise it was 0), after the increment, `cnt` will be 2 if it was initially 1, or `cnt` will be 1 if it was initially 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` remains `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 0, `i` is 1.**
