The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables, `n`, `i_new`, and `i`, remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `i_new`, and `i` is equal to `i_new`, still holds after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i_new`, `i` is `i_new`, `cnt` is increased by 1**.
