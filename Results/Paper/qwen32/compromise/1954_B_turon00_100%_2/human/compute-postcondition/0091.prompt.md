Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The other variables `n` and `a` remain as described in the initial state for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if n == 1 or ans == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0 if the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp` has ended or the length of the last sequence if it hasn't, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` equals 1 or `ans` equals `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of elements equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements starting from `a[0]` that are equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
