The code snippet `tmp = a[0]` reassigns the variable `tmp` to the first element of the list `a`. This means that the value of `tmp` is updated to `a[0]`, but all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of elements equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
