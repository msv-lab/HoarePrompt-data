Reasoning: 
The given program aims to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The program iterates through each test case, counts the lengths of contiguous sequences of equal elements, and finds the minimum length of such sequences. If the array has only one element or consists of a single contiguous sequence, it outputs `-1` because it's impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of contiguous sequences.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The program only considers contiguous sequences of equal elements and finds the minimum length among them. This approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. For example, consider an array like `[3, 3, 4, 3, 3]`. The minimum length of contiguous sequences is `1` (for the `4`), but removing just `4` does not make the array non-beautiful because the remaining array `[3, 3, 3, 3]` is still beautiful. Instead, we need to consider more complex scenarios where removing elements can disrupt the beautiful property.

The program should instead look for the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements and consider removing elements outside this sequence to break the beautiful property. However, the current implementation does not address this correctly.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
