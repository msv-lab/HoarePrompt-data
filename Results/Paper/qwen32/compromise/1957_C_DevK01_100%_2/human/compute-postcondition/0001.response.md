To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n` in this case. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 because the loop starts from `i = 2` and goes up to `n + 1`. The variables `t`, `k`, and `dp` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2. The initial value of `i` is managed by the `range` function and does not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 2. The values of `t`, `k`, and `dp` do not affect the execution of the loop and can remain as they are.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp` is a list with values [1, 1]**
