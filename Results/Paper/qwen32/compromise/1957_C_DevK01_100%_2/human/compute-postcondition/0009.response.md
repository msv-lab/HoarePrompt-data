The code `dp.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `dp`. Given that the initial state of `dp` is `[5, 9, 39]`, after the `pop(0)` operation, the list `dp` will be `[9, 39]`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 4, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp` is a list with values [9, 39], `i` is 4**.
