Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated version to verify its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an `n x n` chessboard.
   - Players take turns placing rooks (white and black) such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - After `k` moves, we need to determine the number of possible final configurations.
   - The computer mirrors the player's move unless the move is on the diagonal (`r == c`), in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - The final configurations are counted modulo `10^9+7`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each move places a white rook at `(r, c)` and a black rook at `(c, r)` unless `r == c`.
   - If a rook is placed on the diagonal, only one rook is placed, and the computer skips its turn.
   - The number of available positions reduces by 2 for each non-diagonal move and by 1 for each diagonal move.
   - The problem reduces to counting the number of ways to place the remaining rooks such that no two rooks attack each other.

### Implementation Analysis

1. **Main Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then processes each of the `k` moves, adjusting `n` based on whether the move is diagonal or not.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations and prints the result modulo `10^9+7`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of ways to place `n` non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` board.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place `i` non-attacking rooks.
   - The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

### Annotated Code Analysis

1. **State Before Function Call:**
   - `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.
   - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5`, and `k` is an integer such that `0 ≤ k ≤ n`.
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 · 10^5`.
   - Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the `i-th` move you made, where `1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n`.
   - It is guaranteed that the `k` moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

2. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `[1, 1]`.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the program calculates `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation and appends it to the `dp` array.
   - The first element of `dp` is then popped to maintain the array size.
   - The final result is `dp[-1]`.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment

1. **Correctness of the Main Loop:**
   - The logic for adjusting `n` based on the moves is correct. Each non-diagonal move reduces `n` by 2, and each diagonal move reduces `n` by 1.

2. **Correctness of the Dynamic Programming Function:**
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` is correctly implemented.
   - The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations describe the state of the program correctly.
   - The final state of the `dp` array is `[9, 39]`, which means `dp[-1]` is `39`. This suggests that for `n = 2`, the number of configurations is `39`, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The dynamic programming function and the main loop are both correctly implemented.

Final: **True**
