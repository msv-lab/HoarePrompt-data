Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by reducing the size of the board based on the moves made and then calculating the number of possible final configurations using a dynamic programming approach. However, there are several issues with the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Reduction of n**: The program reduces `n` by 2 when `a != b` and by 1 when `a == b`. This reduction is correct in terms of the number of positions that are no longer available for placing rooks, but it does not account for the fact that the board is symmetric and the reduction should be handled more carefully. Specifically, when `a == b`, it should reduce `n` by 1, and when `a != b`, it should reduce `n` by 2, but this should be done in a way that respects the symmetry of the board. However, the program does not handle the symmetry correctly in the context of the problem.

2. **Dynamic Programming Implementation**: The dynamic programming function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of configurations for a reduced board size `n`. The formula used in the DP is not correct for this problem. The DP formula should consider the fact that each new rook placement affects the number of possible configurations in a specific way that respects the constraints of the problem (i.e., no two rooks can attack each other).

3. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied correctly in the DP formula, but the formula itself is incorrect for the problem at hand.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations for the given problem. The provided example outputs do not match the expected results based on the problem description, and the dynamic programming approach used is not appropriate for this problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
