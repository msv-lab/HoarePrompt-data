### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the given problem description, the program code, and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by repeatedly performing an operation that sets a subarray to its MEX (minimum excluded value). The operation can be performed up to 500,000 times.

#### Program Analysis:

**Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**
- **Purpose**: Find the subarray `[i, j]` that, when set to its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
- **Current Implementation**: The function calculates a new sum `sm` using the formula `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. This formula does **not** represent the correct sum after setting the subarray to its MEX. The MEX value is not computed or used in this calculation.
- **Issue**: The function does not correctly identify the subarray that should be set to its MEX to maximize the sum.

**Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**
- **Purpose**: Generate operations to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value.
- **Current Implementation**: The function recursively calls itself with the subarray `[r, l-1]` and adds operations to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value. However, the logic for generating these operations is flawed and does not necessarily achieve the goal of setting the subarray to its MEX value.
- **Issue**: The recursive logic and the operations generated do not correctly reflect the process of setting the subarray to its MEX.

**Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**
- **Purpose**: Set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value and generate the corresponding operations.
- **Current Implementation**: The function sets the subarray to the length of the subarray `n` instead of the MEX value. It then calls `func_2` to generate more operations.
- **Issue**: The subarray is set to `n` instead of the MEX value, which is incorrect.

#### Annotated Code:
- The annotated code suggests that the program is intended to find the optimal subarray `[i, j]` to set to its MEX, generate the necessary operations, and update the array accordingly.
- However, the annotations do not address the fundamental issues with the logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the MEX value for any subarray and does not generate the correct operations to maximize the sum of the array. The logic in each function is flawed, and the program does not achieve the desired result.

### Final Answer

Final: **False**
