### Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues based on the annotated version and the problem requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to find the best subarray to replace with its MEX value. However, it does not compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it calculates a sum based on some arbitrary formula (`sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`) and tries to maximize it. This is not what the problem requires. The correct approach should be to find the MEX of the subarray and determine if replacing the subarray with this MEX value increases the total sum.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is recursively adding operations, but the logic is unclear and does not align with the problem's requirements. It does not ensure that the operations are maximizing the sum of the array. The operations added do not seem to follow a logical pattern that would help in maximizing the sum.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to replace the subarray with its MEX value, but the logic is flawed. It does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and instead replaces the subarray with the length of the subarray (`n = l - r + 1`), which is not the correct approach. The MEX of a subarray should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray, and the subarray should be replaced with this MEX value.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Compute the MEX of the entire array.
2. Replace subarrays with their MEX values to maximize the sum.
3. Ensure that the operations do not exceed the limit of \(5 \times 10^5\).

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the provided code does not produce this output. Instead, it will likely produce an incorrect sequence of operations and an incorrect maximum sum because it does not correctly compute and apply the MEX operation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the array by replacing subarrays with their MEX values. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
