The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range parameters `i + 1` and `len(lst)`. Since `i` is 0, the loop starts from `j = 1` and goes up to `len(lst) - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have taken a specific value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, provided that `j + 1` is less than `len(lst)`.

Let's break it down:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value `k` (where `i + 1 <= k < len(lst)`).
- For the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

Since `i` is 0, the range of `j` is from `1` to `len(lst) - 1`. If `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` should be `k + 1`.

The states `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, and `sm` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the loop head variables.

State: **`r` and `l` are `[len(lst) - 2, len(lst) - 1]` if `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`. Otherwise, `r` and `l` are `[0, j]`. `over_sum` is `sm` if `sm` is greater than the initial `over_sum`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `i` is 0, and `sm` is `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1)`. `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `k + 1 < len(lst)`**.

To make it more concrete, if `j` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `j` should be `2`. If `j` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `j` should be `3`, and so on.

Since we do not know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`r` and `l` are `[len(lst) - 2, len(lst) - 1]` if `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`. Otherwise, `r` and `l` are `[0, j]`. `over_sum` is `sm` if `sm` is greater than the initial `over_sum`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `i` is 0, and `sm` is `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1)`. `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, provided `j + 1 < len(lst)`**.
