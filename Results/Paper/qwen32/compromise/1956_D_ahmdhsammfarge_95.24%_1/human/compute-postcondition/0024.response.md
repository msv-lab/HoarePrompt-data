Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the last two elements, plus 4, and `sm` is greater than `over_sum`; `r` is `len(lst) - 2`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`.**

In this output state, the variables `r` and `l` have been assigned the values of `i` and `j`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
