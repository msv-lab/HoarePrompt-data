Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed, with the new operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended to it. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0. The list `ops` now includes the new operation `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `r` and `l` remain the same integers within the specified range, `lst` remains the same list of non-negative integers, and the list `ops` now includes an additional operation `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is still 0.
