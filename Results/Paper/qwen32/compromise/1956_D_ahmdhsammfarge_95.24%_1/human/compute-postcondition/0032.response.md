The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `lst`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and the length of `lst`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `len(lst)`, which means the loop has completed its iterations because `j` is not less than `len(lst)`.

To execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(lst)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `len(lst)`, so for the loop to start the next iteration, `j` should be `i + 1`, which is `len(lst) - 1`.

The state of `lst` does not need to be adjusted as the loop head does not modify it directly. The other variables (`i`, `sm`, `r`, `l`, `over_sum`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted here.

State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + 1`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to `len(lst) - 2` and `l` is set to `len(lst)`, and `over_sum` is set to `sm`.**
