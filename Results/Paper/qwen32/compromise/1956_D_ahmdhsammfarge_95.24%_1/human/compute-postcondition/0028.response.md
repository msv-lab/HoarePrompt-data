The given code snippet recalculates the value of `sm` using a new formula: `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. We need to update the value of `sm` according to this formula while keeping other variables unchanged unless they are affected by the new calculation.

- `lst` remains a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements.
- `i` remains `len(lst) - 2`.
- `j` remains `len(lst)`.
- The new value of `sm` is calculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`.

Let's break down the new value of `sm`:
- `sum(lst[:i])` is the sum of all elements in `lst` up to (but not including) the element at index `i`.
- `sum(lst[j + 1:])` is the sum of all elements in `lst` starting from index `j + 1`. Since `j` is `len(lst)`, this sum is `0` because there are no elements after the last index.
- `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is the square of the number of elements from index `i` to `j` inclusive, which is `1` because `j` is `len(lst)` and `i` is `len(lst) - 2`.

Therefore, the new value of `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + 0 + 1 ** 2 = sum(lst[:i]) + 1`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst)`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + 1`.**
