The code snippet assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `over_sum` with the value of `sm`, and all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `r` is `[i, j]`, `l` is `[i, j]`, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**.
