Postcondition: **`r` and `l` are `[len(lst) - 2, len(lst) - 1]`, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:len(lst) - 2]) + 4` if `sum(lst[:len(lst) - 2]) + 4` is greater than the initial `over_sum`. Otherwise, `r` and `l` remain unchanged. `i` is 0, and `sm` is `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1)`. The current value of `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.**
