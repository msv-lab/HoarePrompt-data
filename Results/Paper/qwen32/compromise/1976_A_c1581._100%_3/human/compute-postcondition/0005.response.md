The provided code snippet only affects the `letters` list by sorting it. The `password` and `digits` lists remain unchanged. Since the `letters` list already contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the password, sorting it will only change the order of these letters if they were not already in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the password, sorted in non-decreasing order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the password, sorted in non-decreasing order.**
