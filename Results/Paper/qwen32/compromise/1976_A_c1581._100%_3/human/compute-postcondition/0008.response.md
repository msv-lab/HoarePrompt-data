The code concatenates the `digits` list and the `letters` list and then joins them into a single string, which is assigned to `sortedPassword`. The `digits` list and `letters` list remain unchanged and still contain the digit characters and lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password`, respectively, sorted in non-decreasing order. The `password` variable also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the password, sorted in non-decreasing order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the password, sorted in non-decreasing order; `sortedPassword` is a string that is the concatenation of `digits` and `letters`.**
