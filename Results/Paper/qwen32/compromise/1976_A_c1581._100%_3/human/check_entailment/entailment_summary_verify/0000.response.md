Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the provided `func_1` function. The function attempts to access `digits[-1]` without checking if the `digits` list is empty, which will result in an `IndexError` if there are no digits in the password. This is a significant issue that needs to be addressed.

The corrected version of `func_1` provided in the assessment properly handles cases where there are no digits or no letters in the password by checking if the digits and letters are sorted separately and ensuring that no letter is followed by a digit. This corrected version correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description.

Given that the original code does not handle the edge cases correctly and the assessment provides a corrected version that does, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
