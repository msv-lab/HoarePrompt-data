### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program meets the problem requirements.

**Problem Requirements Recap:**
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Function Summary Recap:**
The function `func_1` is supposed to check if the given password is strong by ensuring that all digits come before letters, both in non-decreasing order.

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Character Separation:**
   - The function `func_1` separates the characters into `digits` and `letters` lists correctly.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Both `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted.

3. **Validation:**
   - The function checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order, but this is redundant since the lists are already sorted.
   - The function checks if the last digit is less than or equal to every letter in the `letters` list. This check is flawed because it only compares the last digit with the first letter, which does not ensure that no digit comes after any letter.
   - The function constructs a `sortedPassword` string by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists and compares it to the original password. This check is incorrect because it only verifies if the password is in a specific sorted order, not if the original password meets the problem's conditions.

**Issues Identified:**
- The function does not correctly check if no digit comes after any letter. It only checks the last digit against the first letter.
- The function does not handle the case where there are no digits or no letters correctly, leading to potential errors.

**Correct Implementation:**
To correctly implement the solution, we need to ensure:
- All letters appear before any digits.
- Digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    # Check if all letters are before any digits
    if any(char.isdigit() for char in password[:len(letters)]):
        return False
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    return digits == sorted(digits) and letters == sorted(letters)
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original function, the provided program does not correctly verify the passwords according to the problem description. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws in the provided program.

**Final Evaluation:**
Final: **False**
