### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized.
- Penalty `p(b)` for a subsequence `b` is defined as the number of indices `i` where `b[i] < b[i+1]`.

#### Code Analysis:
- The code iterates through each test case, reads the size of the array `n`, and the array `l`.
- It initializes `a` to the first element of the array and `b` and `c` to 0.
- It then searches for the first element in the array that is greater than the first element (`a`) and assigns it to `b`.
- After finding `b`, it iterates through the rest of the array starting from the element after `b`.
- During the iteration, it updates `a` and `b` based on certain conditions and increments `c` whenever it finds an element greater than both `a` and `b`.
- Finally, it prints the value of `c`.

#### Issues with the Code:
- The logic of the code does not correctly compute the minimum penalty. The code seems to be counting elements that are greater than both `a` and `b`, but this does not directly translate to minimizing the penalty.
- The approach does not consider splitting the array into two subsequences `s` and `t` in a way that minimizes the penalties `p(s)` and `p(t)`.
- The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as arrays where all elements are the same or arrays where the elements are in decreasing order.

#### Correct Approach:
- To minimize the penalty, we need to split the array in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences in both `s` and `t` is minimized.
- One optimal strategy is to split the array into two parts at the point where the maximum penalty occurs, effectively minimizing the penalties in both parts.

Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
