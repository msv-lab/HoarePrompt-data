Let's analyze the provided program against the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to minimize the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)` by splitting the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t`. The penalty `p(b)` for any subsequence `b` is defined as the number of indices `i` where `b[i] < b[i+1]`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to achieve this by iterating through the array and maintaining two variables `a` and `b`, which seem to represent the last elements of subsequences `s` and `t` respectively. It also maintains a counter `c` which seems to count the number of times it finds an increasing pair in one of the subsequences.

However, there are several issues with the logic used in the program:

1. **Initialization and Logic for Subsequences**: The program initializes `a` to the first element of the array and `b` to 0. Then it tries to find the first increasing pair to set `b`. This approach doesn't ensure that `a` and `b` are the last elements of subsequences `s` and `t` respectively.

2. **Updating `a` and `b`**: The program updates `a` and `b` based on the comparison of the current element with `a` and `b`. However, this doesn't guarantee that the subsequences `s` and `t` are being formed optimally to minimize the penalties.

3. **Counting Increasing Pairs**: The program increments `c` when it finds an increasing pair, but this doesn't directly relate to minimizing the penalties of both subsequences.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program doesn't handle edge cases like arrays with all equal elements or arrays with only one element correctly.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem optimally, we need to consider the following:

- The optimal strategy is to split the array such that the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences is minimized.
- One effective way to achieve this is to sort the array and split it into two halves. This ensures that the number of increasing pairs in each half is minimized.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with the provided program, it does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
