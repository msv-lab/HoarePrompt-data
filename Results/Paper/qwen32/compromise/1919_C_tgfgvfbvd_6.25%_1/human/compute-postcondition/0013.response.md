Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `n` must be greater than `y + 1`
- `y` is incremented by 1

Code Snippet:
```python
b = l[y]
```

Impact Analysis:
- `y` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `y` is `y + 1`.
- `b` is assigned the value of `l[y]`, which means `b` now holds the element at index `y + 1` of the list `l`.

Output State:
- `n` must still be greater than `y + 1` (which is now `y + 1 + 1` or `y + 2`).
- `y` is now `y + 1`.
- `b` is assigned the value `l[y]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `y + 2`; `y` is `y + 1`; `b` is `l[y]`.**
