Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `a` is `l[0]`, `b` is the first `l[y]` that is greater than `l[y-1]` if such a pair exists, otherwise `b` is `0`, `c` is `0`, `y` is the last value it was assigned in the loop.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, and `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the if condition was met. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, `a` remains `l[0]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `a` becomes `l[0]` and `b` becomes `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and either `a` is set to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` and `b` are both set to `l[x]` with the additional condition that if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `a` is specifically set to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is specifically set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `a` or `b` is set to `l[x]` based on whether `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b` or not, and `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, `a` or `b` is set to `l[x]` based on whether `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` or not. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, `a` or `b` is set to `l[x]` based on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
