Postcondition: **`y` is any integer, `n` must be greater than `y + 1`. The element `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, and the current value of `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`. Additionally, the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.**
