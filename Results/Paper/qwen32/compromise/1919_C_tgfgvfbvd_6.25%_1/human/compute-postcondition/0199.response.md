Postcondition: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `l[y + 2]` is set to `a` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`; otherwise, `l[y + 2]` is set to `b`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `l[y + 2]` is set to `a` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[y + 2]`; otherwise, `l[y + 2]` is set to `b`.**
