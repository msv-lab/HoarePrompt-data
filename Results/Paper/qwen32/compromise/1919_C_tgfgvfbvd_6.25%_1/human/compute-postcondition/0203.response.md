To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the effect of the provided code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `y` is any integer
- `n` is greater than `y + 2`
- `x` is `y + 3`

Code Snippet:
```python
b = l[x]
```

The code snippet accesses the element at index `x` in the list `l` and assigns it to the variable `b`. 

Since `x` is defined as `y + 3`, and `y` is any integer, `x` will be `y + 3`.

The value of `b` will be the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`.

The preconditions about `y`, `n`, and `x` remain valid, except now `b` holds the value from the list `l` at index `x`.

Output State: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 2`, `x` is `y + 3`, `b` is `l[y + 3]`**.
