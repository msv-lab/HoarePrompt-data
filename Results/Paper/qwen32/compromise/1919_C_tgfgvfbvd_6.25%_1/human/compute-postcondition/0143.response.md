To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `a` is the smallest element in the list `l`.
- `b` is the second smallest element in the list `l` (or the same as `a` if there is no distinct second smallest element).
- `c` is the count of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.
- `n`, `l`, and `y` are unchanged, but their specific values are not relevant to determining the output of `print(c)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(c)
```

### Analysis:
The variable `c` is explicitly defined as the count of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`. Since `a` is the smallest element and `b` is the second smallest element (or the same as `a` if there is no distinct second smallest element), any element greater than both `a` and `b` must be larger than the second smallest unique element in the list.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(c)` statement will be the count of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`)**
