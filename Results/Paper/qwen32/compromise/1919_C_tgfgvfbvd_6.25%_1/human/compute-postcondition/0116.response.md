To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `x`, `y`, and `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `y` is 0.
- `l` is the list of integers read from the input.
- `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the conditions described.

From the loop statement, we can infer that `x` starts from `y + 1` and goes up to but does not include `n`. Since `y` is 0, `x` starts from 1 in the first iteration. After each iteration, `x` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `x` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `y` remains unchanged as it is part of the range definition and does not change within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper bound of the range.

Since the problem specifies that we only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`x`, `y`, and `n`), we don't need to consider `l`, `a`, `b`, or `c` for this adjustment.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `x` was `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be `k + 1`.

However, since we don't have the specific value of `x` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `x` should be incremented by 1 from whatever value it had at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

If we assume `x` was 1 at the end of the first iteration (since `y` is 0 and `x` starts from `y + 1`), then at the start of the next iteration, `x` would be 2.

So, a concrete example of the state could be:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is 2**.

But the most general answer, without assuming a specific value for `x`, is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
