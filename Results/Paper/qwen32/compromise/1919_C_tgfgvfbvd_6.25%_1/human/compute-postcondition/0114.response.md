Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` becomes `l[x]` if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` becomes `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` remains `l[0]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `a` becomes `l[0]` and `b` becomes `l[x]`.**
