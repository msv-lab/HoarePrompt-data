Output State: **`l` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is the value of `l[y]`, `c` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, and the current value of `l[y]` is greater than `l[y - 1].`**

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated to be the same as `l[y]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
