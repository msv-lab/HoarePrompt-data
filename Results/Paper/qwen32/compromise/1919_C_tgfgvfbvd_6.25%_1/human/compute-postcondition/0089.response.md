The value of `b` is updated to the element at index `y` in the list `l`. Given that `y` is 3, `b` is now assigned the value of `l[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `a` is `l[0]`, `y` is 3, `b` is `l[3]`**.
