To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `x` and `n`.

Given:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- The loop condition is `for x in range(y + 1, n):`.

Since `y` is 0, the loop starts with `x` initialized to `y + 1`, which is 1. After each iteration, `x` is incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was incremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1 again from its current value.

Let's summarize the adjustments needed:
- `x` needs to be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

If we denote the value of `x` at the end of the previous iteration as `x_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration, `x` would be `x_prev + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `x_prev`, we can express the state as:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is `x + 1`**.

However, to be precise and clear, let's assume `x` at the end of the previous iteration was some specific value, say `x_end`. Then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is `x_end + 1`**.

Since we don't have `x_end`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

For clarity, if we assume `x` at the end of the previous iteration was 2 (as an example), then at the start of the next iteration, `x` would be 3. But without a specific value, we use the generalized form.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
