To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- `y` is any integer.
- `n` is greater than `y + 1`.
- `x` is `y + 2`.

Code snippet:
```python
b = l[x]
```

Here, `b` is assigned the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l`. Since `x` is `y + 2`, `b` will be the value at index `y + 2` in the list `l`.

The values of `y`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged by this operation. However, a new variable `b` is introduced and assigned a value from the list `l`.

Output State: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `b` is `l[y + 2]`.**
This means that `b` now holds the value of the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`.
