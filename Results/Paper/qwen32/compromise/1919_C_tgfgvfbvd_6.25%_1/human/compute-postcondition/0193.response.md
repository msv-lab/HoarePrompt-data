To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

Initial State: 
- `y` is any integer
- `n` is greater than `y + 1`
- `x` is `y + 2`

Code Snippet:
```python
a = l[x]
```

This line of code assigns the value at index `x` of the list `l` to the variable `a`. 

Given that `x` is `y + 2`, the value of `a` will be `l[y + 2]`.

Since the list `l` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. However, we know that `a` will take the value of the element at index `y + 2` from the list `l`.

The values of `y`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `a` is `l[y + 2]`**.
