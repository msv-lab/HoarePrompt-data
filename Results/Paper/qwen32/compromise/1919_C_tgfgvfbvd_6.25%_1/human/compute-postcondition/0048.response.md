The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `y`, `x`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `x` is `y + 2`. If `l[y + 2] - a >= l[y + 2] - b`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 2]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 2]`. `c` is incremented by 1.**
