The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), representing the size of the array a. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), which are the elements of the array a. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
