Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is assigned the value of the first integer input.**

Natural Language: The variable `N` is now assigned the value of the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other details about the input structure remain unchanged.
