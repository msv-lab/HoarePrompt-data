Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10) and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters 'W' or 'B' with at least one 'B'. For each test case, the function returns the index (1-based) of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`.**
