You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6

Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

    #State: After all iterations, the program will have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, it will output the length of the modified list `nums` followed by the elements of `nums`. The list `nums` starts with the first 21 powers of 2 (from 2^0 to 2^20), then modifies this list based on the value of `k` by removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and adding three new elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem according to the provided description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
2. There should be no subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `k`.
3. For every integer `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `v`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program generates a sequence using powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This is because the sum of the first 21 powers of 2 (i.e., \(2^0\) through \(2^{20}\)) can generate all sums from 1 to \(2^{21} - 1\) (which is much larger than \(10^6\)). However, the program then modifies this sequence to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Generate Powers of 2**: The program generates a list of numbers `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^20]`.
2. **Find the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `k`**: It finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and stores its index.
3. **Modify the Sequence**:
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]` to the sequence.
   - It appends `k + 1` to the sequence.
   - It appends `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the sequence.
   - It removes the element at the found index (`nums[idx]`).

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
- **Subsequence Sum Not Equal to `k`**: By removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and adding specific values (`k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`), the program ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`. This is because the removed value is crucial for forming the sum `k`, and the added values do not help in forming `k` due to their specific construction.
- **Subsequence Sums for All Other Values**: The original sequence of powers of 2 can form all sums from 1 to \(2^{21} - 1\). The modifications made do not disrupt this property for values other than `k`. Specifically, the addition of `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensures that sums greater than `k` can still be formed, and the removal of `nums[idx]` only affects the formation of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly address the requirements of the problem. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) to be formed. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach appears sound.
