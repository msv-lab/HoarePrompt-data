The given code snippet reassigns the `nums` variable to a new list comprehension. This new list contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).

Here's the breakdown:
- The original `nums` list contained specific values including some derived from `k` and powers of 2, but it also had an element removed based on the value of `idx`.
- The new assignment of `nums` overrides the previous list with a new list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).

Thus, the updated `nums` list will be `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `idx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power exists.**
