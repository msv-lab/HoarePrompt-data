The value of `idx` is updated to be `i - 1`. Since `i` was previously `i + 1`, the new value of `idx` is now the original value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `i` is `i + 1`; `idx` is the original value of `i`**.
