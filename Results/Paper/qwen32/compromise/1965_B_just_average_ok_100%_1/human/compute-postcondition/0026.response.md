The given code snippet redefines the `nums` list to contain powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). This means `nums` will now be `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.

The previous definition of `nums` included additional elements like `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`, and had an element `1 << idx` removed. However, the new assignment completely overrides the previous definition.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists.**

In simpler terms, `nums` is now a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), and all other variables remain unchanged.
