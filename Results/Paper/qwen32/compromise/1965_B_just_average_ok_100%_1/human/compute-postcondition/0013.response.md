To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this variable is not part of the loop head and thus does not need adjustment).
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input (these variables are not part of the loop head and thus do not need adjustment).
- `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2 (this list is not modified within the loop and thus does not need adjustment).
- `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

The loop condition is `for i in range(len(nums))`, meaning the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`.

Let's break down the steps:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than the length of `nums`.
3. Since `nums` contains 21 elements (from 1 to 1048576), the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 21.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `i` is incremented by 1**.

If `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 4.

So, if we assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `i` is 4**.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, if we need a specific value, let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `i` is 4**.
