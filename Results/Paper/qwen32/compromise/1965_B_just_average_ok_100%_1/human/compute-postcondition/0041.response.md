To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop behavior and how it affects the variables.

The loop iterates over the list `nums` which contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). The loop checks each element to see if it is greater than `k`. If it finds an element greater than `k`, it sets `idx` to the index of the previous element and breaks out of the loop. If no such element is found, `idx` remains -1.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. If `k` is less than 1, the loop will not find any element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, so `idx` will remain -1.
2. If `k` is between 1 and 2 (exclusive), the loop will set `idx` to 0 because `nums[1]` (which is 2) is the first element greater than `k`.
3. If `k` is between 2 and 4 (exclusive), the loop will set `idx` to 1 because `nums[2]` (which is 4) is the first element greater than `k`.
4. This pattern continues up to `k` being between 1048576 and 2097152 (exclusive), where `idx` would be set to 20.
5. If `k` is 1048576 or greater, the loop will iterate through all elements of `nums` without finding any element greater than `k`, so `idx` will remain -1.

Thus, the final value of `idx` depends on the value of `k`.

### Final Output State

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` remain as integers obtained from the input.
- `nums` remains the list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576].
- `idx` is determined based on the value of `k`: it will be the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power exists.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power exists.**
