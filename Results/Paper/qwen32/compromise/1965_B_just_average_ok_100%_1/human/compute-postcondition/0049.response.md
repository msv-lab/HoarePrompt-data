The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `nums` is a predefined list with specific elements and conditions related to `k` and `idx`. However, the code only modifies `n` and `k` by reading new values from the input.

Since the code does not affect `t`, `nums`, or `idx`, these remain unchanged. The only changes are to `n` and `k`, which are now assigned the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`] with the element `1 << idx` removed; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power exists.**
