Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), and an integer `y` which is always 0. Additionally, it receives `x` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
