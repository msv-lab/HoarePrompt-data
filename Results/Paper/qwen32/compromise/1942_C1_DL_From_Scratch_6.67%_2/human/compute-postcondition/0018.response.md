Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is an integer read from the input such that x > 1, `y` is the third integer read from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of x distinct integers provided in the second line of each test case, each ranging from 1 to n, `num` is `list0[6] - list0[5] - 1`, `i` is 5. If `num` equals 1, `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.**
