Reasoning:
The original assessment is correct, and the program provided is indeed incorrect. The problem requires checking if Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two and rearranging the pieces. The key insight is that this is possible if and only if at least one of the sides of the original rectangle is even. This is because if both sides are odd, the only way to cut the rectangle would result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with integer sides.

The provided function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if `b` is even and does not consider the value of `a`. This is insufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The correct implementation should check if either `a` or `b` is even, and return 'Yes' if so, and 'No' otherwise.

Here is the correct implementation based on the reasoning:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'Yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'No'
```

This implementation correctly checks if either `a` or `b` is even, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Final: **False**
