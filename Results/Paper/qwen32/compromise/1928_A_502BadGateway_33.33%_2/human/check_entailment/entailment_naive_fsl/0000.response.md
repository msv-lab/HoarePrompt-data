Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle. The function `func_1` only checks if the width `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle.

Let's analyze the problem requirements:
- Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
- He can then form another rectangle using these two smaller rectangles.

For Bob to form another rectangle, at least one of the following conditions must be true:
- The height `a` is even, allowing the rectangle to be cut into two rectangles of size `a/2 x b`.
- The width `b` is even, allowing the rectangle to be cut into two rectangles of size `a x b/2`.

The current program only checks if `b` is even, which means it fails to consider cases where `a` is even but `b` is odd.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:
- Input: `2 3`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (because the rectangle can be cut into two `2x1` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `1x4` rectangle)
- Actual Output: `No`

To fix the program, we need to check both `a` and `b` for evenness:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'Yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'No'
```

With this correction, the program will correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle for all valid inputs.
