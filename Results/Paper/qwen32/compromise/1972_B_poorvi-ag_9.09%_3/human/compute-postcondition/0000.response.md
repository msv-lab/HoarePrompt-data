Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The initial state for the number of coins `n` and the string `s` for each test case remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The values for `n` (number of coins) and `s` (string of "U" and "D") for each test case are not yet processed by this snippet. Therefore, only `t` is updated in the output state.
