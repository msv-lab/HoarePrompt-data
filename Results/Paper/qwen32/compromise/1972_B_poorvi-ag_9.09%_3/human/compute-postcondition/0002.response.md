The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop counter and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts; it will be set to 0 by the `range` function.

Given that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, and `i` will be initialized by the `range` function, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is within the valid range (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `s` for each test case remain unchanged; `results` is an empty list**.

Since the task specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `t`), and `i` will be managed by the `range` function, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure `t` is within the valid range.

Final State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `s` for each test case remain unchanged; `results` is an empty list**.
