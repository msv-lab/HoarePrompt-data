The code snippet provided, `letters.sort()`, sorts the list `letters` in ascending order. The variable `password` and `digits` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation on `letters`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the password, sorted in ascending order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the password, sorted in ascending order.**
