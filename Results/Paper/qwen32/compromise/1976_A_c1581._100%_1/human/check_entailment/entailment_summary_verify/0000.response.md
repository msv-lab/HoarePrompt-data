### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` against the problem description and the given function summary.

**Problem Description Recap:**
A password is considered strong if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. It consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit comes after a letter.
3. All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Function Summary:**
The function `func_1` checks if the input `password` string, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, is already sorted such that all digits come before letters, and both digits and letters are individually in ascending order. It returns `True` if the password meets these conditions, otherwise it returns `False`.

**Program Analysis:**
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself. It then calls `func_1(password)` to check if the password is strong.

**Issues in the Program:**
1. **Digit and Letter Order Check:** The function `func_1` does not correctly check if no digit comes after a letter in the original password. Instead, it only checks if the last digit is not greater than any letter, which is insufficient. For example, the password "a1b" should be "NO" because '1' comes after 'a'.
2. **Sorting and Comparison:** The function constructs a sorted password and compares it to the original password. However, this does not correctly handle the requirement that no digit should come after a letter in the original password.

**Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:**
- **Digit and Letter Separation and Sorting:** The function separates digits and letters, sorts them individually, and then checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
- **Digit and Letter Order Check:** The function checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, which is not sufficient.
- **Final Comparison:** The function constructs a new password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters and compares it to the original password. This check does not ensure that no digit comes after a letter in the original password.

**Counterexample:**
Consider the password "a1b":
- The function will separate the digits and letters, sort them, and then check the conditions.
- It will find that the digits are sorted and the letters are sorted.
- It will also find that the last digit (1) is not greater than any letter (a, b).
- However, the original password "a1b" has a digit (1) coming after a letter (a), which violates the requirement.

**Correctness:**
The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the requirement that no digit should come after a letter in the original password.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly verify the passwords according to the problem description. It fails to ensure that no digit comes after a letter in the original password, which is a critical requirement.
