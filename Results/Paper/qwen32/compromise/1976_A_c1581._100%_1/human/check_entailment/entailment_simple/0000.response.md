### Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem requirements and the program's approach to verify the correctness.

1. **Password Structure**: The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. **Order Constraints**:
   - No digit should come after a letter.
   - All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It separates the password into `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts both `digits` and `letters`.
   - It checks if the `digits` are in non-decreasing order (though this is redundant since they are sorted).
   - It checks if the largest digit is less than or equal to the smallest letter (ensuring no digit comes after a letter).
   - It constructs a `sortedPassword` by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters`.
   - Finally, it checks if the `sortedPassword` matches the original password.

**Key Points**:
- The separation and sorting of digits and letters ensure that the digits are in non-decreasing order and the letters are in non-decreasing order.
- The check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]` ensures that no digit comes after a letter.
- The final comparison `if sortedPassword == password` ensures that the original password matches the expected sorted structure.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
