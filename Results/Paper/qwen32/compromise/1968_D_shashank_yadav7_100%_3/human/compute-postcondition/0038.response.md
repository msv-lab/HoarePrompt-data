The code snippet updates the value of `bm` by comparing its current value with `a[b] * k + bp`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `bm` is already defined as `max(max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp)`. The new value of `bm` will be the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`.

Since `a[b] * k + bp` is already one of the terms used to calculate the initial `bm`, the value of `bm` will not change if `a[b] * k + bp` is less than or equal to the current `bm`. If `a[b] * k + bp` is greater than the current `bm`, then `bm` will be updated to this new value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is -2, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sp * k, a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] * k + sp, a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] * k + sp)`**. 

In simpler terms, `bm` remains the same or is updated to `a[b] * k + bp` if it's greater than the current `bm`.
