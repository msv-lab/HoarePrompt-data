Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is -1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sp * k, a[s] * k + sp)`. Since `k` is not equal to 0, no changes are made to the variables and the program does not break out of the loop or if statement.**
