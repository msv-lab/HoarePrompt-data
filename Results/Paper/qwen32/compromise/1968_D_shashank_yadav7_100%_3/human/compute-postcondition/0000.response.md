Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each testcase, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n. a is a list of n integers where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input, which is within the specified range of 1 to 10^4. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as the code snippet only affects the variable `t`.
