Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `k` is 0; `s` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, with `s` now being `s - 1` and `b` being `b - 1`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `bp * k`; `sm` is `sp * k`.**
