The code snippet `sp += a[s]` updates the value of `sp` by adding `a[s]` to its current value. 

Given the initial state, `sp` is initially `a[s] - 1`. After the operation `sp += a[s]`, `sp` becomes `(a[s] - 1) + a[s]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[s] - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0; `i` is 2; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s] - 1`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b]`; `sm` is `max(0, sp)`**
