The code snippet modifies `sm` by comparing its current value with `a[s] * k + sp` and taking the maximum of the two. No other variables are modified.

Given:
- `sm` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we'll assume it has some initial value.
- `a[s]` is `sp`.
- `a[b]` is `bp`.
- `bm` is `a[b]` if `k` equals 0, otherwise `a[b] * (k + 1)`.

The only change is to `sm`, which becomes the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 3; `s` is `p[previous_s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; If `k` equals 0, then `bm` is `a[b]`. Otherwise, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`. `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`.**
