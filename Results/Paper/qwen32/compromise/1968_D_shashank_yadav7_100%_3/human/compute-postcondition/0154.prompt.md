Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each testcase, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n. a is a list of n integers where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0; n is the same; k is 0; i is k + 1; s is the final value after k + 1 updates; b is the final value after k + 1 updates; p is a list of integers obtained from the input; a is a list of integers obtained from the input; sp is the cumulative sum of a[s] over k + 1 iterations; bp is the cumulative sum of a[b] over k + 1 iterations; bm is the maximum value of bm encountered during the iterations; sm is the maximum value of sm encountered during the iterations. If bm is greater than sm, then bm is greater than sm. Otherwise, bm is less than or equal to sm.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the input value; `k` is 0; `i` is 2; `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations; `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` over the number of iterations; `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` over the number of iterations; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over the iterations; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over the iterations. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the input value; `k` is `max(0, initial_k - n)`; `i` is `n + 2`; `s` is the result of `p` list updates for `n` iterations; `b` is the result of `p` list updates for `n` iterations; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for `n` iterations; `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for `n` iterations; `bm` is the maximum `a[b] * k + bp` encountered during the loop; `sm` is the maximum `a[s] * k + sp` encountered during the loop; and `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
