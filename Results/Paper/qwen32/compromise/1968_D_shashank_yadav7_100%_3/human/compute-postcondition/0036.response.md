Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is -2, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sp * k, a[s] * k + sp, a[s] * k + sp)`**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions as given in the initial state.
