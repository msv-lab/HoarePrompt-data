The code snippet `bp += a[b]` modifies the value of `bp` by adding `a[b]` to it. 

Given the initial state, `bp` is initially `3 * a[b]`. After the operation, `bp` becomes `3 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[b]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is -2, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] + a[s]`, `bp` is `4 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**
