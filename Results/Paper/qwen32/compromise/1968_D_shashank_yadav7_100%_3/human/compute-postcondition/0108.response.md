Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the input value; `k` is the input value; `i` is 3; `s` is the input value minus 1; `b` is the input value minus 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` over the number of iterations; `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` over the number of iterations; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over the iterations; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over the iterations; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is decremented by 1, so if `s` was initially the input value, it is now the input value minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
