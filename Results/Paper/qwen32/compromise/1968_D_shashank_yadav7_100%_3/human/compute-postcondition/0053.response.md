The given code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. This means the previous values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are overwritten with the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the input value; `k` is the input value; `i` is `k + 2`; `s` is the input value; `b` is the input value; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` over `k + 1` iterations; `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` over `k + 1` iterations; `bm` is the maximum value of `bm` encountered during the iterations; `sm` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the iterations. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**
