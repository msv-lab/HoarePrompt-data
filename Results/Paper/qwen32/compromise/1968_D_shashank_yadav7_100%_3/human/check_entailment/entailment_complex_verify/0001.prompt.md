You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Game Mechanics**: 
    - Players start at specific positions in the permutation.
    - Each turn, a player's score increases by the value at their current position in array `a`.
    - Players can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by their current position in array `p`.
    - The game lasts for `k` turns.
    - The winner is the player with the higher score after `k` turns.

2. **Input**:
    - `t`: Number of test cases.
    - For each test case:
        - `n`: Length of the permutation.
        - `k`: Number of turns.
        - `P_B`: Bodya's starting position.
        - `P_S`: Sasha's starting position.
        - `p`: The permutation array.
        - `a`: The array of scores.

3. **Output**:
    - For each test case, output "Bodya" if Bodya wins, "Sasha" if Sasha wins, or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Initialization**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, and `a`.
    - `b` and `s` are adjusted to be 0-based indices (`b -= 1` and `s -= 1`).

2. **Initial Scores**:
    - `bp` and `sp` are initialized to the scores at Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions, respectively (`a[b]` and `a[s]`).
    - `bm` and `sm` are initialized to the maximum possible scores if each player stays at their starting position for `k` turns (`a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k`).

3. **Simulation of the Game**:
    - The program runs a loop for `k` turns.
    - In each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation array `p`.
    - It updates the scores of Bodya and Sasha by adding the score at their new positions in array `a`.
    - It keeps track of the maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`) for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

4. **Determination of the Winner**:
    - After `k` turns, the program compares `bm` and `sm`.
    - It prints "Bodya" if `bm > sm`, "Sasha" if `bm < sm`, and "Draw" if `bm == sm`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
    - The initial calculation of `bm` and `sm` as `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` is incorrect. This assumes that staying at the same position for `k` turns always gives the highest score, which is not necessarily true.
    - The program does not correctly account for the possibility of moving to different positions that might yield higher scores.

- **Logic Error in the Loop**:
    - The loop iterates `n` times, but it should iterate `k` times.
    - The logic inside the loop is flawed because it incorrectly updates `bm` and `sm` without considering all possible moves.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
