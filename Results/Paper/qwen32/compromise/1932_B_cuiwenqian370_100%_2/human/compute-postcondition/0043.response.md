Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n + 1`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`; `n` is `int(data[index - 1])`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n - 1:index - 1]`; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`; `i` is `n-1`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[n-1]) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`.**

In natural language: The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, making it `index + n + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
