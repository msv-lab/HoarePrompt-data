Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's calculate the output state step by step.

### Given:
- `data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace.
- `input` holds the entire input string.
- `index` is `index + n`.
- `T` is an integer value greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.
- `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`.
- `n` is an integer value greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`.
- `last_year` is the first element of `a`.
- `i` is 1.
- `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
```

### Calculation:
- `last_year` is the first element of `a`.
- `i` is 1, so `a[i]` refers to the second element of `a`.
- The expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1)` simplifies to `(last_year + a[i])`.
- The entire expression is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`.

Since `//` is integer division, `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i]` will result in 1 if `last_year` is less than `a[i]`, and it will be greater than 1 if `last_year` is equal to or greater than `a[i]`. However, multiplying by `a[i]` will result in `a[i]` if `last_year` is less than `a[i]`, and it will be the nearest multiple of `a[i]` greater than or equal to `last_year` if `last_year` is equal to or greater than `a[i]`.

Given `last_year` is equal to `next_year` before the assignment, and considering the operation, `next_year` will be recalculated based on the above logic.

### Output State:
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`; `n` is an integer value greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is the first element of `a`; `i` is 1; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`.**

In simpler terms:
- The values of `data`, `input`, `index`, `T`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `last_year`, and `i` remain the same.
- `next_year` is recalculated to be `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`.
