The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` updates the value of `n` by converting the `index`-th element of the list `data` to an integer.

Given the initial state, `n` is an integer value greater than 0, and `data` is a list of strings. The new value of `n` is determined by the integer conversion of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`; `n` is `int(data[index])`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`; `i` is `n-1`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[n-1]) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `n` is now the integer value of the string located at the `index` position in the `data` list, while all other variables retain their previous values or expressions.
