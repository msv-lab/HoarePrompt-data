The provided code snippet only reads the input from the standard input but does not process it further. Therefore, the variables `t`, `n`, and `a_i` remain undefined in the context of this code execution. The only change is that the input is read into the variable `input`.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. `input` holds the entire input string.**
