The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is decremented by 1.

Given that `T` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `T` is still greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`; `n` is an integer value greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`; `i` is `n-1`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[n-1]) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`.**
