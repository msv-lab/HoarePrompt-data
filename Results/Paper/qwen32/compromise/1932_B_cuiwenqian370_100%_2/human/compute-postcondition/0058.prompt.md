Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is 1; `T` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    last_year = a[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
        last_year = next_year
    results.append(str(last_year))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is index + n; `T` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `last_year` is the final calculated year after all iterations; `i` is n - 1; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`; `n` is an integer value greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`; `i` is `n-1`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[n-1]) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace, `input` holds the entire input string, `index` is `index + 2*n + 1`, `T` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`, `last_year`, and `last_year`, `n` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `last_year` is the final value calculated after all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `next_year` is the final value of `last_year`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
