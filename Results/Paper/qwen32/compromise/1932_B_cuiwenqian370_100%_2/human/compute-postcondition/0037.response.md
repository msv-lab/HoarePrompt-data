Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`; `n` is an integer value greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`; `i` is 3; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[3]) // a[3] * a[3]`.**

In natural language: The value of `last_year` is updated to be equal to `next_year`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
