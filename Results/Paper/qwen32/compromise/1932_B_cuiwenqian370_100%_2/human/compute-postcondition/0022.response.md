The code snippet provided appends the string representation of `last_year` to the `results` list. 

Given the initial state, the value of `results` was an empty list. After the execution of `results.append(str(last_year))`, `results` will contain one element, which is the string representation of `last_year`. 

The values of other variables such as `data`, `input`, `index`, `T`, `n`, `a`, `last_year`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is index + n; `T` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `last_year` is the final calculated year after all iterations; `i` is n - 1; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.**
