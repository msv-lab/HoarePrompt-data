The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the only change in the state is the addition of the `results` list, which is initially empty.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is 1; `T` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `results` is an empty list.**
