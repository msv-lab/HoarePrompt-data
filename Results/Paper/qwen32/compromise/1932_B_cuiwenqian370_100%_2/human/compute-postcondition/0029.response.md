The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, as the range function starts from 1 and goes up to (but does not include) `n`.

Given that `i` is initially set to `n - 1` before the loop starts, and the loop starts with `i` being 1, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` should start at 1 for the loop to begin correctly.

So, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`; `n` is an integer value greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is the first element of `a`; `i` is 1; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`**
