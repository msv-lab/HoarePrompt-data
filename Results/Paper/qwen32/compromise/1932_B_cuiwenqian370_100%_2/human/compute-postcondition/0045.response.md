The code snippet `index += n` increases the value of `index` by the value of `n`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the Initial State:
- `data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace.
- `input` holds the entire input string.
- `index` is `index + n + 1`.
- `T` is an integer value greater than 0.
- `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`.
- `n` is `int(data[index - 1])`.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `next_year` is `(last_year + a[n-1]) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`.

After executing `index += n`, the new value of `index` will be `index + n + 1 + n`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + 2*n + 1`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`; `n` is `int(data[index - 1])`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`; `i` is `n-1`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[n-1]) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`.**
