You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
The Chaya tribe has `n` signs of the apocalypse, each occurring periodically every `a_i` years. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the `i+1`-th sign can only occur after the `i`-th sign. The task is to determine in which year the `n`-th sign will occur.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the year in which each sign occurs sequentially. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.

2. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs on the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year + 1`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it stores the year of the `n`-th sign in the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints all results.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify if the program handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

- **Single Sign (n=1):**
  - If there is only one sign, the year of the apocalypse is simply `a[0]`.
  - The program correctly handles this case since `last_year` is initialized to `a[0]`.

- **Multiple Signs:**
  - For multiple signs, the program correctly calculates the year of each sign based on the previous sign's occurrence.
  - The formula used ensures that each sign occurs on the next multiple of its periodicity after the previous sign.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If all signs have the same periodicity (e.g., `a = [1, 1, 1]`), the program correctly calculates the year as `n` (since each sign occurs every year).
  - If the periodicities are different, the program correctly calculates the year based on the sequential occurrences.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all described scenarios, including edge cases. It follows the problem description accurately and calculates the year of the `n`-th sign correctly for each test case.

Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The program reads the input correctly, initializes the year of the first sign, and iteratively calculates the year for each subsequent sign using the correct formula. It handles all edge cases and scenarios described in the problem statement, ensuring the correct output for every potential input.
