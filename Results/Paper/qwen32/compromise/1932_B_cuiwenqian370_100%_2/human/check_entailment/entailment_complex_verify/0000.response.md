### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the program and its annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.
   - This part is correctly implemented and verified by the annotations.

2. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
   - This formula simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + a[i]}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
   - This is equivalent to finding the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly computes the next year for each sign based on the previous sign's occurrence.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it stores the year of the `n`-th sign in the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints all results.
   - The annotations indicate that the results are correctly computed and formatted for output.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Sign (n=1):**
     - If there is only one sign, the year of the apocalypse is simply `a[0]`.
     - The program correctly handles this case since `last_year` is initialized to `a[0]`.
   - **Multiple Signs:**
     - For multiple signs, the program correctly calculates the year of each sign based on the previous sign's occurrence.
     - The formula used ensures that each sign occurs on the next multiple of its periodicity after the previous sign.
   - **All Signs with the Same Periodicity:**
     - If all signs have the same periodicity (e.g., `a = [1, 1, 1]`), the program correctly calculates the year as `n` (since each sign occurs every year).
   - **Different Periodicities:**
     - If the periodicities are different, the program correctly calculates the year based on the sequential occurrences.

5. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations provide a detailed state of the program at key points, confirming that the logic is correctly implemented and the results are as expected.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all described scenarios, including edge cases. It follows the problem description accurately and calculates the year of the `n`-th sign correctly for each test case. The annotations support the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
