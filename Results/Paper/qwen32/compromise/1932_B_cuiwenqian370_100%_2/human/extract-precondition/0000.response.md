Precondition: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.**
