Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `freq` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, initialized with all values set to 0.**

In natural language, the output state indicates that `arr` remains unchanged as a list of integers where each integer is within the range from 0 to `n-1`, and `n` is the length of this list. Additionally, a new list `freq` is created with a length of `n + 1`, and all its elements are initialized to 0.
