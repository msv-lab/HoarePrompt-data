### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, given that Alice and Bob play optimally. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - It initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates through `arr` and increments the count of each element in `freq`.

3. **Determine MEX**:
   - It initializes a counter `cou` to 0.
   - It iterates through the `freq` array from `0` to `n`.
     - If the frequency of an element is `2` or more, it skips that element.
     - If the frequency of an element is `1`, it increments `cou`.
     - If `cou` reaches `2` or if the frequency of an element is `0`, it prints the current index `i` (which is the MEX) and breaks the loop.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX of an array is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.
  - The program correctly identifies the smallest missing integer by iterating through the frequency array and checking for the first index with a frequency of `0` or after encountering the second unique element.
  - If an element appears twice or more, it is skipped, ensuring that only unique elements are considered for determining the MEX.

- **Optimal Play**:
  - The problem states that Alice wants to maximize the score (MEX) and Bob wants to minimize it.
  - The program calculates the MEX directly from the frequency of elements, which inherently accounts for the optimal play since the MEX is solely dependent on the unique elements and their counts in the final array `c`.
  - The strategy of skipping elements with frequency `2` or more and counting unique elements ensures that the smallest missing integer is correctly identified.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, considering the optimal play of both Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
