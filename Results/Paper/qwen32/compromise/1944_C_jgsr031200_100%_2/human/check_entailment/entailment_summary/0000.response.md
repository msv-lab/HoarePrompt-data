### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the final score of the game, which is the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after the game ends. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`.

The provided program calculates the MEX by counting the frequency of each element in the input array `arr`. It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to `n` and finds the smallest value that either appears exactly once or does not appear at all in `arr`. This approach is based on the observation that the MEX of `c` will be influenced by the elements that are left out or appear only once in `arr` after all elements are chosen alternately by Alice and Bob.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Frequency Counting**: The program first counts the frequency of each element in `arr` using a list `freq` where `freq[i]` represents the count of the number `i` in `arr`.
2. **Finding MEX**: It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to `n`. For each value `i`:
   - If `freq[i] >= 2`, it skips this value because it is not relevant to determining the MEX.
   - If `freq[i] == 1`, it increments a counter `cou` indicating that this value appears exactly once.
   - If `freq[i] == 0` or `cou == 2`, it prints the current value `i` and breaks the loop. This is because:
     - If `freq[i] == 0`, `i` is not present in `arr`, making it a candidate for the MEX.
     - If `cou == 2`, it means we have already encountered two unique elements (each appearing exactly once), and the MEX must be the smallest of these two.

The provided execution summary aligns with this logic. The function `func_1` correctly identifies and prints the MEX based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, given the optimal play by Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: True**
