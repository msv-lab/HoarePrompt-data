You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2

    6

    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total in an \( n \times n \) grid.

### Key Observations
1. **Diagonals in the Grid**:
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from the top-left to bottom-right.
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from the top-right to bottom-left.
   - Total diagonals = \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Coloring Strategy**:
   - To minimize the number of colored cells while ensuring that \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to strategically place the colored cells.
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), we can cover \( k \) diagonals by coloring cells on the main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left). This is because each cell on the main diagonals can cover two diagonals (one from each set).
   - If \( k > 2n \), we need to color additional cells to cover the remaining diagonals. This is because the main diagonals can only cover up to \( 2n - 2 \) diagonals when considering overlaps.

### Mathematical Formulation
- For \( k \leq 2n \), the minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). This is because each cell can cover at most two diagonals.
- For \( k > 2n \), the minimum number of cells required is \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \). This accounts for the fact that we need to cover more diagonals beyond the main diagonals.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows the above logic:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)

func()
```

- The program first handles the special case where \( k = 1 \), which requires only one cell.
- For \( k \leq 2n \), it calculates the minimum number of cells using \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
- For \( k > 2n \), it calculates the minimum number of cells using \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the strategy to find the minimum number of cells needed to color at least \( k \) diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
