The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is defined as `c + 3*x` and `x` is the next element in the list `l`, the value of `c` changes before being appended. However, since the exact value of `x` (and thus `c`) is not specified, we express `c` in terms of its definition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing three elements, the first two equal to `c` and the third equal to `c + 3*x`, `c` is `c + 3*x`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
