Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1, `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. Additionally, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, then the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed, which does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`, `a`, `b`, or `s`.**
