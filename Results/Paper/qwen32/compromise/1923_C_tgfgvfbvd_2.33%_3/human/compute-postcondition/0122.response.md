The given code snippet assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to `s`. This means the value of `s` will be updated to reflect the cumulative sum up to the `b-1` index in the list `p`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains the first integer obtained from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer obtained from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `p` remains a list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added.
- `c` remains the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `_` remains 3.
- `a` and `b` remain the two integers obtained from the latest input.
- `s` is now `p[b - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `_` is 3; `a` and `b` are the two integers obtained from the latest input; `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
