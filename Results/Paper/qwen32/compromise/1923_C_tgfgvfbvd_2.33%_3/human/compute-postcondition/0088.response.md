The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `l`. This means that the value of `l` changes to whatever list of integers is provided by the input.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `p`, `c`, `_`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1; `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1; `_` is 1.**
