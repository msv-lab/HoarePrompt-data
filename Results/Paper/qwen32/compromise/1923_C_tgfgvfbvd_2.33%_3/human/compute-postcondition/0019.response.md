The code snippet subtracts `p[a - 2]` from `s`. Given that `s` was initially `p[b - 1]`, the new value of `s` will be `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Additionally, `a - 2 >= 0`.**
