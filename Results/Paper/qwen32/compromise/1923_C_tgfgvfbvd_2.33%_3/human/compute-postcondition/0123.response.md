The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from it. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is initially `p[b - 1]`.

After executing the code, `s` becomes `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `_` is 3; `a` and `b` are the two integers obtained from the latest input; `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
