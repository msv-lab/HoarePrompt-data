The code snippet assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes its value is `s`, which now holds the value of the element at index `b - 1` in the list `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1, `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
