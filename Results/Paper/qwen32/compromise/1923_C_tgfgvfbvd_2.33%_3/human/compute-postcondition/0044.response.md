The given code snippet updates the values of `n` and `m` based on the input. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `m` must be greater than 0. The values of `t`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `_` remain unchanged.

After executing the code, `n` and `m` are reassigned to the values obtained from the input, split into two integers. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0 is still valid but not explicitly checked in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `_` is 1.**
