The given code snippet resets the list `p` to an empty list. This affects only the variable `p`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `c`, and `_`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is an empty list; `c` is the sum of all elements in the original `l`; `_` is 1.**
