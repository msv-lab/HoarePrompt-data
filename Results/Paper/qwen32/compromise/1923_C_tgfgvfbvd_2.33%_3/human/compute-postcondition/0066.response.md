Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` is an integer greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1; `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1; `_` is 1; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. Additionally, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s` is less than 2 * (b - a + 1)**
