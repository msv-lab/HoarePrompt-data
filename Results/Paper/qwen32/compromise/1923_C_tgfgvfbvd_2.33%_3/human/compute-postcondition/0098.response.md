The given code snippet increments the variable `c` by the value of `x`. Based on the initial state, `x` is described as "the next element in the list `l`". Therefore, the new value of `c` will be its previous value plus `x`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains the first integer obtained from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer obtained from the input.
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element.
- `p` remains a list containing the value of `c` and the new value of `c` which is `c + x + x`.
- `c` is now `c + x`.
- `_` remains 1.
- `x` remains the next element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element; `p` is a list containing the value of `c` and the new value of `c` which is `c + x + x`; `c` is `c + x`; `_` is 1; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
