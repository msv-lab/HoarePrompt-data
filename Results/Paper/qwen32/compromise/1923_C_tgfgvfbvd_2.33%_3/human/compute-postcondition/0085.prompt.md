Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1; `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1; `_` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` is an integer greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1; `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1; `_` is 1; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. Additionally, if `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s` is at least twice the value of `b - a + 1`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s` is less than 2 * (b - a + 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1, `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. Additionally, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, then the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed, which does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`, `a`, `b`, or `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1, `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1, `_` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the specific condition of the if part holds. Otherwise, the else part holds, but since the else part does not change any variables, the state remains as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
