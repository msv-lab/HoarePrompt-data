Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`:** An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable represents the number of test cases, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
2. **Variable `n`:** The first integer obtained from the input. It is not used in the provided code snippet.
3. **Variable `m`:** The second integer obtained from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1. It is also not used in the provided code snippet.
4. **List `l`:** A list of integers obtained from the new input. This list is used to compute the cumulative sums.
5. **List `p`:** A list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added. This means `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `l`.
6. **Variable `c`:** The sum of all elements in `l`. This variable is not used in the provided code snippet.
7. **Variable `_`:** Set to 2. This variable is not used in the provided code snippet.
8. **Variables `a` and `b`:** Two integers obtained from the latest input. These are used to compute `s`.
9. **Variable `s`:** Computed based on the values of `a` and `b`. Specifically, if `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.

### Code Snippet Analysis:

The provided code snippet is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Determining the Output:

The `print` statement in the code snippet outputs the string `'YES'`. The value of `'YES'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any of the variables or lists defined in the initial state.

### Final Output:

Based on the analysis, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
