In the given task, the loop head is defined by the variable `_` which is set to `m` and is used in the `range` function. Since the loop iterates `m` times, at the start of each new iteration, `_` should reflect the remaining number of iterations.

Given that the loop has already executed `m` times, the loop would have finished its execution if no adjustments were made. Therefore, to execute one more time, `_` should be reset to 1 (indicating one more iteration).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- The loop head only involves the variable `_`.
- `_` is initialized to `m` and decremented by 1 in each iteration.
- After `m` iterations, `_` would be 0, and the loop would terminate.
- To execute one more time, `_` should be set to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `_` set to 1. Other variables like `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s` are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` is an integer greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1; `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1; `_` is 1**
