The code snippet appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is defined as `1 + x`, and `x` is the next element in the list `l`, the list `p` will now contain two elements: the initial value `1` and the new value `1 + x`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` remain integers obtained from the input with `m` being greater than 0.
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element.
- `p` is now a list containing the integers `[1, 1 + x]`.
- `c` remains `1 + x`.
- `_` remains 1.
- `x` remains the next element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is a list containing the integers `[1, 1 + x]`; `c` is `1 + x`; `_` is 1; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
