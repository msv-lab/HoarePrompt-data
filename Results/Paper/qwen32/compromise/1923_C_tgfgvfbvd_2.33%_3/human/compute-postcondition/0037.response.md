The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from it. 

Given:
- `s` is initially `p[b - 1]`.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.

After executing the code, `s` becomes `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are the integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; `_` is 1.**
