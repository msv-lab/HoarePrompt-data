The code snippet assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. Given that `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `s` will now hold the cumulative sum up to the index `b - 1` in the list `l`.

Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
