Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.
- `_` is set to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains only one `print` statement, which directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

### Explanation:
- The value of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s` are all defined based on the input, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The variable `_` is set to 1, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the previously defined variables.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
