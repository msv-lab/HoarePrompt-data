The code snippet provided subtracts `p[a - 2]` from `s`. Given the initial state, `s` is initially set to `p[b - 1]`. After executing the code, the new value of `s` will be `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1, `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
