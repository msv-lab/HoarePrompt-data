The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a counter for the number of iterations. According to the loop statement, the loop will execute `int(input())` times. Since `_` is decremented in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be set to its previous value plus one, assuming that the loop condition is still satisfied.

Given that the loop has already executed `m` times, the value of `_` at the start of the next iteration should be 1 (since `_` would have been 0 at the end of the previous iteration).

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `_` is 1**.
