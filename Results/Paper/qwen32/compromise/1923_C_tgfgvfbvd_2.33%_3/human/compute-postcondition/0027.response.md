The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state except for `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`
- Additionally, either `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, or `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)`
- `_` is decremented by 1

After executing the code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())`, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new integers read from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are new integers obtained from the input; If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`; Additionally, either `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, or `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)`; `_` is decremented by 1.**
