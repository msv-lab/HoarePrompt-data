Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

        l = list(map(int, input().split()))

        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); the loop has executed `t` times, with each execution involving reading `n` and `m`, a list `l` of `n` integers, computing cumulative sums into list `p`, and processing `m` queries. Each query involves reading `a` and `b`, computing `s` as the sum of elements from index `a-1` to `b-1` in `l`, and printing 'YES' if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, otherwise 'NO'. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` are reset for each test case, while `_` in the outer loop is decremented until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function calculates the sum of the elements in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) and prints 'YES' if the sum is at least twice the number of elements in the queried range and the range contains more than one element; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
