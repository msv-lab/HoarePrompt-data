You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #This is printed: The `print` statement will output each integer from the `result` list on a new line.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` and calculates the number of screens required based on the given conditions. It then outputs the number of screens required for each test case on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on the minimum number of 5x3 screens.
- Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).
- A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- The program should output the minimal number of screens needed for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `y`, the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons respectively.

2. **Calculations:**
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is just `x` (the total cells occupied by 1x1 icons).
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, which is the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - `total_space` is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`, but this variable is not used in the logic.
   - `screen_require_for_y` is calculated to determine the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. If `y` is even, it's `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, it's `y // 2 + 1` because each screen can fit at most two 2x2 icons.
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This represents the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `space_x` (the number of 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, it means that the 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining cells without needing extra screens. Hence, the total number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, it means that additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons. The program calculates the extra space needed and the number of additional screens required to fit these icons.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there are no icons (`x=0` and `y=0`), the program correctly outputs `0` screens.
   - If there are only 1x1 icons, the program calculates the number of screens as `x // 15 + (1 if x % 15 != 0 else 0)`, which is correct.
   - If there are only 2x2 icons, the program calculates the number of screens as `y // 2 + (1 if y % 2 != 0 else 0)`, which is correct.
   - If there is a mix of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, the program calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons first, then checks if the remaining cells are sufficient for 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the result for each test case on a separate line.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens. It accounts for the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
