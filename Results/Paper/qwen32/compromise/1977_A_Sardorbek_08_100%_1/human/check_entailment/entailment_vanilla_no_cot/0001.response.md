Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
Nikita can either add or remove one cube at a time. We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves starting from 0 cubes.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Addition and Removal**: Each move either adds or removes one cube.
2. **Parity (even/odd)**: After an even number of moves, the number of cubes will have the same parity (even or odd) as the initial number of cubes (which is 0, an even number). After an odd number of moves, the number of cubes will have the opposite parity.
3. **Range of Cubes**: The number of cubes after `n` moves can be anywhere from `0` to `n` inclusive.

#### Conditions:
- If `n == m`, it is possible (all moves are additions).
- If `n < m`, it is impossible (cannot have more cubes than moves).
- If `n >= m`, it is possible if `n - m` is even (since the difference between the number of additions and removals must be even).

### Program Analysis
Let's examine the given program to see if it correctly implements the above logic:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line does nothing and can be removed
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Breakdown of the Program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
2. **Checking Conditions**:
   - `if b == c`: If `n == m`, it prints 'YES'. This is correct.
   - `elif b < c`: If `n < m`, it prints 'NO'. This is correct.
   - `elif b % 2 == c % 2`: If `n` and `m` have the same parity, it prints 'Yes'. This is correct.
   - `else`: If `n` and `m` have different parities, it prints 'No'. This is correct.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. It handles all the conditions described in the problem analysis.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
