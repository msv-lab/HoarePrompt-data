Reasoning:
The program correctly handles the logic for determining if it's possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. If `b == c`, it means the number of moves `b` is exactly the number of cubes `c` Nikita wants to have. Since he can add one cube per move, he can achieve exactly `m` cubes in `n` moves if `n == m`. The program correctly prints 'YES' in this case.

2. If `b < c`, it means Nikita wants more cubes than the number of moves he can make. Since he can only add or remove one cube per move, he cannot have more cubes than the number of moves he makes. Hence, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

3. If `b > c` and `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), it is possible for Nikita to achieve `m` cubes. Here's why: if he starts with 0 cubes, he can add cubes until he reaches `m` (or a number with the same parity as `m`), and if he has more cubes than `m` at any point, he can remove cubes to reach `m`. Since the parity of the number of cubes changes with each move, it's only possible to reach a final count with the same parity as the number of moves. The program correctly prints 'YES' in this case.

4. If `b > c` and `b` and `c` do not have the same parity, it is impossible for Nikita to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because the parity of the number of cubes changes with each move, and he cannot reach a final count with a different parity than the number of moves. The program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

The execution summary aligns with the problem's requirements and the program's logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
