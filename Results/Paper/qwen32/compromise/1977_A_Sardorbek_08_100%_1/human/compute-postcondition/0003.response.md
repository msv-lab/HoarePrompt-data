The function `func` accepts an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 100. For each of the `t` test cases, the function also accepts two integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the conditions provided for each test case. Since the specific conditions for processing `n` and `m` are not detailed, the functionality will be described in terms of accepting and processing these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`. It processes these inputs and returns a value for each test case based on unspecified conditions.**
