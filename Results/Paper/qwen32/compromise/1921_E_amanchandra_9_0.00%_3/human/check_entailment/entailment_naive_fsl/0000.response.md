Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic and identify the issues:

1. **Condition `xa > xb`:**
   - The program prints "Draw" if `xa > xb`. This is incorrect because the relative positions of Alice and Bob vertically do not solely determine the outcome. Alice can still win if she can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach hers, regardless of whether `xa > xb` or `xa < xb`.

2. **Handling of Moves:**
   - The program calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2` and uses it to determine the range of columns within which Alice or Bob can move. However, this approach does not fully account for the optimal moves and possible captures.
   - The conditions for printing "Alice" and "Bob" are based on the calculated range, but they do not consider all possible scenarios where one player might be able to force a win. For example, if Alice is directly below Bob and can move diagonally to capture him, the current logic might not correctly identify this.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when Alice and Bob are in positions where they can directly capture each other in the next move, or when they are in positions where one player can force a draw by blocking the other player's moves.

To correctly determine the outcome of the game, a more comprehensive analysis of the positions and possible moves is required. Here is a more detailed approach:

- If Alice is directly below Bob and can move diagonally to capture him, Alice wins.
- If Bob is directly above Alice and can move diagonally to capture her, Bob wins.
- If neither player can capture the other in the next move, and one player is blocked from making any further moves, the game is a draw.
- Otherwise, the player who can force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a move wins.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios, making it incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
