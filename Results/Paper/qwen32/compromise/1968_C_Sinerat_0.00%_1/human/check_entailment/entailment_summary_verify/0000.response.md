### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not guarantee the correct construction of the array `a` such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\). Let's break down the reasoning and validate it:

1. **Initialization and Construction**:
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 500, which is within the required range.
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]`, it calculates `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

2. **Verification Against Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).
   - The program's construction method (`a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`) does not inherently ensure this condition holds for all inputs.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Example 1**:
     - Input: `3 1 1`
     - Output: `500 501 502`
     - Verification:
       - \(x_1 = 1\) and \(a_1 \bmod a_0 = 501 \bmod 500 = 1\) (Correct)
       - \(x_2 = 1\) and \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 502 \bmod 501 = 1\) (Correct)
     - This example works, but it does not prove the general correctness.
   
   - **Example 2**:
     - Input: `3 2 3`
     - Output: `500 502 505`
     - Verification:
       - \(x_1 = 2\) and \(a_1 \bmod a_0 = 502 \bmod 500 = 2\) (Correct)
       - \(x_2 = 3\) and \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 505 \bmod 502 = 3\) (Correct)
     - This example also works, but again, it does not cover all cases.
   
   - **Counterexample**:
     - Input: `3 501 501`
     - Output: `500 1001 1502`
     - Verification:
       - \(x_1 = 501\) and \(a_1 \bmod a_0 = 1001 \bmod 500 = 1\) (Incorrect)
       - This counterexample shows that the program fails to satisfy the condition for certain inputs.

4. **General Case**:
   - The program's method of constructing `a` does not ensure that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all inputs, especially when `x_i` is larger than `a[i-1]`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not guarantee that the constructed array `a` will satisfy the required condition for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
