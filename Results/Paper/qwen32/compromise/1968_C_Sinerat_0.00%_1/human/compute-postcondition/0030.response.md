The value of `a[0]` is set to 500. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the integer input by the user, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all set to 0, `_` is 1, and `i` is `n`. Only the first element of `a` is modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements where the first element is 500 and the rest are 0; `_` is 1; `i` is `n`.**
