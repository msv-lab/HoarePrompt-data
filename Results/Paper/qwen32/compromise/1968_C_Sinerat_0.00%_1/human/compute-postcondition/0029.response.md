The given code snippet reassigns `a` to be a list of `n` zeros, which overrides the previous definition of `a` as a list with the first element as 500 and the subsequent elements calculated based on the sum of 500 and the first `i-1` elements of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all set to 0; `_` is 1; `i` is `n`.**
