Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is 500, the `i`-th element is the sum of 500 and the first `i-1` elements of `x`, and the rest are set to 0 if not yet modified; `_` is 0; `i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `a` will be a list where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` from 2 to `n`) is the sum of 500 and the first `i-1` elements of the list `x`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` at the end of the loop, and the other variables `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
