Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value. `decoded` includes the appropriate elements based on the mapping rules. `char` is the next character in the `encoded` string. `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `chr(c)` is in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` may include `'b'` as a key with `char` as the value.**
