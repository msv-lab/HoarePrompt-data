The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `encoded` and the current `char`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the last character processed from `encoded`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more characters in `encoded` to process.

Let's denote the length of `encoded` as `n`. If `char` was the last character of `encoded` in the previous iteration, then `char` was `encoded[n-1]`. For the loop to execute again, `char` should be the next character in `encoded`, which would be `encoded[n-1+1]` or `encoded[n]` if we consider the next index. However, since we don't have an `n` index (as `n` is the length of the string), the loop will terminate after processing `encoded[n-1]`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` should be the next character in the sequence, which would be `encoded[i+1]` where `i` is the current index of `char` in `encoded`.

Since we don't have an explicit index variable in the loop head, we can infer that `char` should be the next character in the string `encoded` after the last processed character.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value, `decoded` is a list containing either the value `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or `chr(c)` if `char` is not in `mapping` and `'a'` is added to `mapping` with `char` as its value, `char` is the next character in `encoded` after the last processed character**.

To make it more concrete, if `char` was `encoded[i]` in the last iteration, then in the next iteration, `char` should be `encoded[i+1]`.
