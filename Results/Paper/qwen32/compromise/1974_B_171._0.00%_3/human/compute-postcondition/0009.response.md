Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary with the key `chr(c)` and the value `char`, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` except as the newly added value, and `chr(c)` is now a value in `mapping`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, and `chr(c)` remain unchanged. The program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
