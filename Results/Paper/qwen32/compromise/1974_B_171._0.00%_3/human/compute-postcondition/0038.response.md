The code appends the character `chr(c)` to the list `decoded`. Given the initial state, `decoded` initially contains the character `char` (the first character in `encoded`). After executing the code, `decoded` will now contain two characters: the original `char` and the new `chr(c)`.

Output State: **`mapping` includes a key-value pair where the key is the first character `chr(c)` not in the values of `mapping` and the value is `char` (the first character in `encoded`); `decoded` is a list containing `char` and `chr(c)`**.
