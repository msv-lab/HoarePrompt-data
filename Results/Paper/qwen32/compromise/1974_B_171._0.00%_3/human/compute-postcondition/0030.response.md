The given code snippet updates the `mapping` dictionary with a new key-value pair. The key is `chr(c)`, which is `chr(98)` or `'b'`, and the value is `char`. Since the problem statement does not specify the value of `char`, we will keep it as `char`.

Given the initial state, if `chr(c)` (which is `'b'`) is not already a key in `mapping`, it will be added with the value `char`. If `'b'` is already a key in `mapping`, its value will be updated to `char`.

Since the problem statement does not specify the initial contents of `mapping`, we assume that `'b'` is not initially in `mapping` for the most specific output state.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `mapping` includes a key-value pair where the key is `'b'` and the value is `char`; `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` was not in `mapping` initially; `char` is the next character in `encoded`; `c` is 98.**
