To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior and its effect on the variables `mapping` and `decoded`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over all lowercase Latin letters from `'a'` to `'z'` (ASCII values from 97 to 122). For each character `chr(c)`, it checks if `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`. If it is not, it updates `mapping` with a new key-value pair where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char` (the next character in `encoded`). Then, it breaks out of the loop.

### Iterations:
1. **First Iteration**: If `'a'` is not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include `{'a': char}`. `decoded` is updated to include `[char]`. The loop breaks after this.
2. **Second Iteration**: If `'b'` is not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include `{'b': char}`. `decoded` is updated to include `[char]`. The loop breaks after this.
3. **Third Iteration**: If `'c'` is not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include `{'c': char}`. `decoded` is updated to include `[char]`. The loop breaks after this.

### Conclusion:
The loop breaks after the first iteration where it finds a character `chr(c)` that is not in the values of `mapping`. Therefore, the loop will only execute once if `'a'` is not in `mapping`. If `'a'` is in `mapping`, it will check `'b'`, and so on, until it finds a character that is not in `mapping`.

### Final Output State:
The final output state will be determined by the first character in `encoded` that is not already a value in `mapping`. If `mapping` was initially empty, the first character in `encoded` will be mapped to `'a'`, and `decoded` will contain this character.

Output State: **`mapping` includes a key-value pair where the key is the first character `chr(c)` not in the values of `mapping` and the value is `char` (the first character in `encoded`), and `decoded` is a list containing `char`.**

For example, if `encoded` is `"xyz"` and `mapping` is initially empty:
- After the first iteration, `mapping` will be `{'a': 'x'}` and `decoded` will be `['x']`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`mapping` includes a key-value pair where the key is the first character `chr(c)` not in the values of `mapping` and the value is `char` (the first character in `encoded`), and `decoded` is a list containing `char`.**
