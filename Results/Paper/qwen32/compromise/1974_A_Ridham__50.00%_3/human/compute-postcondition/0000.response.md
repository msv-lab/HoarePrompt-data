Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is an input integer.**

Natural Language: The initial state conditions for `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. A new variable `n` is introduced and assigned the value of an input integer.
