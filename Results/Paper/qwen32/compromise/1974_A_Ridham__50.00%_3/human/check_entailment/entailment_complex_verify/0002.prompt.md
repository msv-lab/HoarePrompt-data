You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires us to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on a minimum number of 5x3 grids. Each 5x3 grid has 15 cells. The 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells, and the 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons `x` and 2x2 icons `y`.

2. **Calculating Space Requirements:**
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1` (which is just `x`), representing the total space (cells) needed for 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, representing the total space (cells) needed for 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculating Screens Needed for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd. This is because each screen can fit up to 3 2x2 icons (since 3 * 4 = 12 < 15).

4. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining cells in the screens used for 2x2 icons, which is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Placing 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells can accommodate all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), then the total number of screens needed is just `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If there are not enough remaining cells, the program calculates the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons. It does this by calculating the extra space needed (`extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`) and then determining how many full screens are needed for these extra cells. If `extra_space % 15 == 0`, then the number of additional screens is `extra_space // 15`. Otherwise, it's `extra_space // 15 + 1`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens needed for each test case to the `result` list and prints the results at the end.

### Correctness Check

The logic described above seems to correctly account for placing both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens. It handles the cases where 2x2 icons fill up screens and calculates the remaining space for 1x1 icons accurately. It also correctly calculates additional screens needed for any leftover 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program, it appears to follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
