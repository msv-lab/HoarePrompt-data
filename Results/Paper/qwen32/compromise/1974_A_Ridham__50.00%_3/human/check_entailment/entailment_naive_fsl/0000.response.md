Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program aims to determine the minimum number of screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid (15 cells total).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `x` and `y`.
2. **Space Calculation**:
    - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is just `x`.
    - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, representing the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
    - `total_space` is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.
3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
    - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.
    - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
    - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, which represents the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
5. **Screen Requirement for 1x1 Icons**:
    - If `space_x` (remaining 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then the total screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
    - Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons and adds them to `screen_require_for_y`.

### Edge Cases to Consider

1. **No Icons** (`x = 0`, `y = 0`):
    - Expected Output: `0` screens.
    - Program Output: `0` screens.
2. **Only 1x1 Icons** (`y = 0`):
    - Expected Output: `ceil(x / 15)` screens.
    - Program Output: Correctly calculates the screens.
3. **Only 2x2 Icons** (`x = 0`):
    - Expected Output: `ceil(y / 2)` screens.
    - Program Output: Correctly calculates the screens.
4. **Mixed Icons** (`x > 0`, `y > 0`):
    - Expected Output: Properly accounts for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons, ensuring no overlap and minimum screens.
    - Program Output: Needs verification for various combinations.

### Test Cases and Validation

Let's validate the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Provided Examples:
1. `1 1` -> Output: `1` (Correct)

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. `15 0` -> Output: `1` (Correct)
2. `16 0` -> Output: `2` (Correct)
3. `0 2` -> Output: `1` (Correct)
4. `0 1` -> Output: `1` (Correct)
5. `9 0` -> Output: `1` (Correct)
6. `10 0` -> Output: `1` (Correct)
7. `14 0` -> Output: `1` (Correct)
8. `13 0` -> Output: `1` (Correct)
9. `12 1` -> Output: `2` (Correct)
10. `11 1` -> Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion
