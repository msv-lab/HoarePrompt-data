You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of lists where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the amounts of water in the containers for each test case. The sum of the integers in each inner list is divisible by n. The length of nums (t) is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. Each integer a_i in the inner lists satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of lists where each inner list contains `n` integers (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the amounts of water in the containers for each test case. The sum of the integers in each inner list is divisible by `n`. The length of `nums` (t) is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer `a_i` in the inner lists satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. `n` is the length of `nums`. `total` is the sum of all integers in `nums` and `total` is divisible by `n`.
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: curr is 0.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns the string 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the amounts of water in the containers for each test case. The function checks if it is possible to redistribute the water in such a way that each container in a test case has the same amount of water. If it is not possible, the function returns 'NO'. If it is possible, the function returns 'YES'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns the string 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
