The code snippet assigns the variable `n` the length of the list `nums`. The length of `nums` represents the number of test cases, which is between 1 and 10,000. The other properties of `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the amounts of water in the containers for each test case. The sum of the integers in each inner list is divisible by n. The length of `nums` (t) is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer a_i in the inner lists satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `n` is the length of `nums`.**
