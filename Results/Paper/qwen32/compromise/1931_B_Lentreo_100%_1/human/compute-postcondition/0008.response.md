To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the given loop and the initial state provided.

The loop iterates over each inner list in `nums` (which we'll interpret as iterating over each element in a single list of `n` integers, given the context). During each iteration, it calculates the difference between the current element and the `mean` of the list and adds this difference to `curr`. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, the function immediately returns 'NO'. 

Given that the sum of the integers in each inner list is divisible by `n`, the `mean` is an integer, and the total sum of deviations from the mean (both positive and negative) across all elements in the list must sum to zero. This is because the mean is essentially the balancing point where the sum of positive deviations equals the sum of negative deviations.

Thus, if the loop completes without `curr` ever going negative, it means that the cumulative sum of deviations has never dipped below zero at any point during the iteration. This is possible if the positive deviations are always sufficient to counterbalance the negative deviations as we iterate through the list.

Since the problem does not specify any conditions that would force `curr` to go negative (given the properties of the mean and the sum of deviations), and there is no return statement inside the loop other than the one for `curr < 0`, the loop will complete all iterations without returning 'NO'. After completing all iterations, `curr` should theoretically be zero because the sum of all deviations from the mean is zero.

Thus, the final state of `curr` after the loop completes all iterations should be zero.

Output State: **curr is 0.**
