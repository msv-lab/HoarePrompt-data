The code calculates the mean of all integers in the list of lists `nums` by dividing the `total` sum of all integers by `n`, the number of test cases (or the length of `nums`). The variable `mean` is assigned this calculated value.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list contains `n` integers (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the amounts of water in the containers for each test case. The sum of the integers in each inner list is divisible by `n`. The length of `nums` (t) is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer `a_i` in the inner lists satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. `n` is the length of `nums`. `total` is the sum of all integers in `nums` and `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is the integer value of `total` divided by `n`.**
