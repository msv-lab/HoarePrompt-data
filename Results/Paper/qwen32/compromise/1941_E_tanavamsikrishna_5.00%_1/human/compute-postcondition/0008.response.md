Functionality: **The function reads input values including the number of rows (`n`), number of columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), maximum distance between supports (`d`), a 2D list of integers (`rows`), and calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`. It then computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these sums.**
