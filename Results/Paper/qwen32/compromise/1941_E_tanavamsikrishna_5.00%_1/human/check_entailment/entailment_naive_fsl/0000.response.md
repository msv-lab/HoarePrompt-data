Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a row, and `func_2` fails to handle the problem constraints properly.

### Issues in `func_1`:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Support Costs**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` incorrectly calculates the cost of supports by adding 1 to each cell and then using a sliding window to determine the minimum cost, which does not align with the problem's constraints.
   - The function does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Instead, it simply adds 1 to each cell and then computes the cumulative cost, which is incorrect.

### Issues in `func_2`:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation for Multiple Bridges**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates the cost for each row independently using `func_1` and then sums these costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost.
   - This approach does not consider the constraints on the distance `d` between supports across multiple rows. It assumes that the cost for each row can be calculated independently, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. For each row, determine the minimum cost to place supports such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
2. Use dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for placing supports across `k` consecutive rows while respecting the distance constraint `d`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 5 2 2
0 1 1 1 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 1 1 0
0 3 2 1 0
```
- The correct minimum cost for building 2 bridges with `d=2` should be `8` (as per the problem statement example).
- The provided code will not produce the correct result because it does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the distance constraint `d` across multiple rows.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
