### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges over a river grid, where the cost of a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`. The supports must be placed such that there is one at the start `(i, 1)` and one at the end `(i, m)` of each row, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: `func_1` computes the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
- **Logic**: 
  - It first increments the cost of the first `d-1` cells by 1 because the first support is at `(i, 1)` and the next supports must be within `d` distance.
  - For each subsequent cell, it calculates the cost as `1 + a_{i,j} + min(cost of previous d cells)`. This ensures that the supports are placed within the allowed distance `d` and the cost is minimized.
  - The function returns the cost of the last cell in the row, which represents the total cost of supports for that row.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: `func_2` reads the input, calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), bridges (`k`), and maximum distance (`d`).
  - It reads the depth grid (`rows`) and computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - It then calculates the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum sum.

### Verification:
1. **Function `func_1`**: The function correctly calculates the cost of supports for a single row based on the problem constraints. It ensures that supports are placed at the start and end of the row and within the allowed distance `d`.
2. **Function `func_2`**: The function correctly computes the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows by leveraging the results from `func_1`. It efficiently calculates the sum of costs for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum sum.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work correctly according to the problem description and the provided execution summaries. Therefore, the program as a whole meets the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
