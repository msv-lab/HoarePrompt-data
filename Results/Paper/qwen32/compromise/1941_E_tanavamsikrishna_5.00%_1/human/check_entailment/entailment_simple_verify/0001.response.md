Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and its annotations to ensure that it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
The task is to build `k` bridges over consecutive rows of a grid representing a river, with each bridge having supports that satisfy certain conditions:
- A support must be installed in the first and last columns.
- The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.

The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for all `k` bridges.

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`
This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row `row` with the given maximum distance `d` between supports.

- **Initialization**: The first `d-1` supports are installed at the beginning of the row, and their costs are calculated as `a_{i, j} + 1`.
- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: For each subsequent cell, it calculates the minimum cost by considering the minimum cost of placing a support within the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell) and adds the cost of placing a support in the current cell, which is `a_{i, j} + 1`.

The function returns the cost of installing supports for the entire row.

#### Function `func_2()`
This function handles multiple test cases:
- **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
- **Cost Calculation**: For each row in the grid, it calculates the cost of installing supports using `func_1`.
- **Total Cost Calculation**: It calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and stores these costs in `total_costs`.
- **Output**: It prints the minimum total cost from `total_costs`.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`
- **State Before Function Call**: `row` is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths in a row of the river grid, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports.
- **Step 1**: The first `d-1` elements of `row` are incremented by 1.
- **Step 2**: For each subsequent element, the cost is calculated as the sum of its original value, the minimum value in the preceding `d` elements (if any), and 1.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the last element of the list `row`, which is the cost of installing supports for the entire row.

The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at each step. However, there is a critical issue with the logic in `func_1`. The function does not correctly handle the requirement that a support must be installed in the last column. The function only ensures supports are placed in the first `d-1` columns and then continues with the dynamic programming approach, but it does not explicitly ensure a support is placed in the last column.

#### Function `func_2()`
- **State Before Function Call**: `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, `d` is the maximum distance between supports, `rows` is a 2D list of integers representing the grid, and `costs` is a list of integers representing the cost of installing supports for each row.
- **Step 1**: It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
- **Step 2**: It calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
- **Output**: It prints the minimum total cost.

The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at each step, but the issue in `func_1` propagates to `func_2`.

### Conclusion
The issue in `func_1` is that it does not ensure a support is placed in the last column. This is critical because the problem requires supports in both the first and last columns. The function should explicitly ensure that the last column has a support, which might involve additional logic to adjust the cost calculation.

### Final Evaluation
Given the critical issue in `func_1` regarding the placement of supports in the last column, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
