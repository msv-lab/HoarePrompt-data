### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows, ensuring that supports are placed in the first and last columns and that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
2. **Constraints**:
   - Each row has a cost associated with placing supports based on the depth of the cell.
   - Supports must be placed in the first and last columns.
   - The distance between adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

#### Code Analysis:

**Function `func_1`**:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row.
- **Implementation**:
  - For the first `d-1` elements, it simply adds 1 to each.
  - For the rest of the elements, it calculates the cost based on the minimum value in the preceding `d` elements plus the current depth plus 1.
- **Issues**:
  - The approach does not ensure that supports are placed in the first and last columns.
  - It does not consider the distance constraint `d` between supports correctly. The sliding window approach does not guarantee that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.

**Function `func_2`**:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Implementation**:
  - Reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  - Reads the grid of depths.
  - Applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of placing supports.
  - Sums the costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum.
- **Issues**:
  - Relies on `func_1` which does not correctly calculate the cost for a single row.
  - Does not consider the distance constraint `d` between supports across multiple rows.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not address the core issues with the logic of `func_1` and `func_2`.
- Specifically, the annotations do not mention the critical flaw that `func_1` does not ensure supports are placed in the first and last columns and does not respect the distance constraint `d`.

#### Correct Approach:
- **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to find the minimum cost of placing supports in each row while respecting the distance constraint `d`.
- **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window approach to ensure the distance constraint is met.
- **Multiple Rows**: Use a dynamic programming table to find the minimum cost for `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The function `func_1` does not ensure that supports are placed in the first and last columns and does not respect the distance constraint `d`. The function `func_2` relies on `func_1` and therefore also fails to meet the problem's constraints.

**Final**: **False**
