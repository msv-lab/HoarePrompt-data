Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue is in the logic of the `func_1` function which is supposed to compute the minimum cost of placing supports on a single row. The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly account for the constraints and requirements of the problem, particularly the distance constraint between supports.

Here are some key points of the problem that the current implementation does not address correctly:

1. **Support Placement Constraints**: The function should ensure that there is a support at the first and last column (which is already given as 0 depth), and supports should be placed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The problem requires a dynamic programming approach to efficiently compute the minimum cost of placing supports with the given constraints. The current implementation does not use dynamic programming and instead has a flawed logic that does not correctly compute the minimum cost.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of placing a support at a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`. The function should correctly calculate this cost for each possible placement of supports while respecting the distance constraint `d`.

The implementation should be revised to correctly handle these aspects of the problem. Here is a high-level outline of how the correct solution might look:

- Use dynamic programming to compute the minimum cost of placing supports on each row.
- For each row, maintain a DP array where `dp[j]` represents the minimum cost to place supports up to column `j` with the last support placed at column `j`.
- Ensure that the placement of supports respects the distance constraint `d`.
- After computing the minimum cost for each row, find the minimum total cost of placing `k` consecutive bridges.

Given the complexity of the problem, a correct implementation would involve a more sophisticated approach than the one provided.
