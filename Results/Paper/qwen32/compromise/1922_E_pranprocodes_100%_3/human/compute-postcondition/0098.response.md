Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, 100000000], `t` is 1, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to be the integer division of its previous value by 2. The values of `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.
