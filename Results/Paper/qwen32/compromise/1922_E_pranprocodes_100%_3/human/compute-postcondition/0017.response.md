The only variable in the loop head is `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer input value that is greater than 1. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `x` must remain a value other than 1.

State: **`x` is an integer input value that is greater than 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, `max` is 100000000 if `x` is odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000 if `x` is even, `ans` is a list containing the value -100000000 if `x` is odd, and `t` is 1**
