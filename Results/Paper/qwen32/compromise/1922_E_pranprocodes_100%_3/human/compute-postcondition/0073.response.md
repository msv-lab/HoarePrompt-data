Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1, if `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2 using integer division, `max` is decremented by 1, and `ans` is set to the value of `max`. Otherwise, if `x` is odd, `x` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is set to `min + 1`. `t` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `t` is increased by 1. The values of `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` are updated based on the conditions provided, but their specific values are not further specified.
