To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `x` is initialized to 1.
- `max` is calculated as `100000000 - t_e`, where `t_e` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
- `min` is calculated as `-100000000 + t_o`, where `t_o` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
- `ans` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is either `max` or `min` depending on whether `x` was even or odd in that iteration, but in reversed order.
- `t` is the total number of iterations.
- `i` is initialized to 2.

The `print(t)` statement will output the value of `t`. However, `t` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, and there is no information provided about how `t` is calculated or what its value is. Therefore, we can only describe `t` based on the given information.

Since `t` represents the total number of iterations and no specific value or calculation for `t` is provided, the most precise description we can provide is that `t` is the total number of iterations.

Output: **t (where t is the total number of iterations)**
