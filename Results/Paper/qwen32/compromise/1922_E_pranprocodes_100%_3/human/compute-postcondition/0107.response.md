Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `x` is `x // 2`, `max` is 99999997 if `x` was even, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` was even, `min` is -99999998 if `x` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, 99999998] if `x` was even, `ans` is [100000000, -99999999, 99999999] if `x` was odd, or `ans` is [-100000000, -100000000, 99999999] if `x` was 0, `t` is 2, `i` is 3.**

Natural Language: The value of `x` is now the result of integer division of its previous value by 2. The values of `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.
