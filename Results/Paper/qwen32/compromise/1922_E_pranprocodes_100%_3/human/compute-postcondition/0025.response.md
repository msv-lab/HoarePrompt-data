Output State: **`x` is an integer that has been either halved if it was even or decremented by 1 if it was odd. `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even, and 100000000 if `x` was odd. `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and `x` was originally even, -99999999 if `x` was odd or `x` was originally odd. `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000 and 99999999 if `x` was even, or 100000000 and `min` if `x` was odd and `x` was originally even, or -100000000 and 99999999 if `x` was odd and `x` was originally odd, or -100000000 and `min` if `x` was odd and `x` was originally odd. `t` is 2.**

In simpler terms: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
