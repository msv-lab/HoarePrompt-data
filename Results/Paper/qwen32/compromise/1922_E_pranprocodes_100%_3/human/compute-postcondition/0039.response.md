The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the input value which determines the total number of iterations.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The input value, which determines the total number of iterations `t`, is not changed by the loop itself, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`x` is 1; `max` and `min` are adjusted based on the number of even and odd operations; `ans` is a list of `max` and `min` values based on the operations, but in reversed order; `t` is the total number of iterations; `i` is 2**
