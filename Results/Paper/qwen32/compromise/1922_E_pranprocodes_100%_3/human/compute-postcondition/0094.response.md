The code snippet `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. The previous value of `t` was 0, so `t` is now 1. The values of the other variables (`x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000] if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000], `t` is 1, `i` is 3.**
