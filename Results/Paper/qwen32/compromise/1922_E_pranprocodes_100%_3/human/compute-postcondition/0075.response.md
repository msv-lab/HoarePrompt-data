The code snippet provided is `ans.reverse()`, which reverses the elements of the list `ans` in place. The other variables (`x`, `max`, `min`, `t`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is 1
- `max` is `100000000 - t_e`
- `min` is `-100000000 + t_o`
- `ans` is a list of `t` elements where each element is either `max` or `min` depending on whether `x` was even or odd in that iteration
- `t` is the total number of iterations
- `i` is 2

The only change is that the order of elements in the list `ans` is reversed.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `max` is `100000000 - t_e`, `min` is `-100000000 + t_o`, `ans` is a list of `t` elements where each element is either `max` or `min` depending on whether `x` was even or odd in that iteration, but in reversed order, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is 2.**
