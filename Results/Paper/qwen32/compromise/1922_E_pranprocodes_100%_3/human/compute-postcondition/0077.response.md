Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `x` is initialized to 1.
- `max` is calculated as `100000000 - t_e`.
- `min` is calculated as `-100000000 + t_o`.
- `ans` is a list of `t` elements where each element is either `max` or `min` depending on whether `x` was even or odd in that iteration, but in reversed order.
- `t` is the total number of iterations.
- `i` is initialized to 2.

### Key Points:
1. **Value of `x`:** `x` starts at 1 and is not modified in the provided snippet.
2. **Determination of `max` and `min`:** These values depend on `t_e` and `t_o`, which are not explicitly given. However, they are constants for the purpose of this list construction.
3. **List `ans`:** 
   - The list `ans` is constructed based on the value of `x` in each iteration.
   - If `x` is even, the current element in `ans` is `max`.
   - If `x` is odd, the current element in `ans` is `min`.
   - The list `ans` is reversed before being printed.
4. **Iterations and `x`:** 
   - `x` starts at 1 (odd), so the first element added to `ans` would be `min`.
   - `x` is not modified in the given snippet, so it remains 1 throughout the iterations.
   - Therefore, all elements in `ans` would be `min` because `x` remains odd.
5. **Reversing the List `ans`:** 
   - Since all elements in `ans` are `min`, reversing the list does not change the values but only their order.
   - Given that all elements are the same, the reversed list will have the same elements.

### Conclusion:
Since `x` remains 1 (odd) throughout all iterations, every element in `ans` will be `min`. The list `ans` will be reversed, but since all elements are the same, the reversed list will be identical to the original list.

### Output:
Given that all elements in `ans` are `min`, and `min` is defined as `-100000000 + t_o`, the output will be a list of `t` elements, each being `-100000000 + t_o`.

Output: **min min min ... min (where min is -100000000 + t_o and there are t such elements)**
