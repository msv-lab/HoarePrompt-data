The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. The value of `max` is 100000000, and since `ans` was initially an empty list, it now contains one element, which is 100000000. The other variables (`x`, `min`, `t`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` must not be equal to 1 and `x` is an even number, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000], `t` is 0, `i` is 3**.
