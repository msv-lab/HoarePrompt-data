Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was originally even, and 100000000 if `x` was originally odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` was originally even, -99999998 if `x` was originally odd, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, `min`] if `x` was originally even, or [100000000, `min`, `min`] if `x` was originally odd, `t` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1, making it an integer greater than 0. The values of `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.
