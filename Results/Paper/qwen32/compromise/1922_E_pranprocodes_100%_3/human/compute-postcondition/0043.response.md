The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list, discarding its previous value which was a list of `max` and `min` values based on the operations in reversed order. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is 2**.
