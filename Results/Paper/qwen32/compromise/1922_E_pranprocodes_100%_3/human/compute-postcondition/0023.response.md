Output State: **`x` is an integer input value that is greater than 1 and has been decremented by 1, `max` is 99999999 if the original `x` was even, `max` is 100000000 if the original `x` was odd, `min` is -99999999 if the original `x` was even, `min` is -99999998 if the original `x` was odd, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000 and `min` if the original `x` was even, `ans` is a list containing the value -100000000 and `min` if the original `x` was odd, and `t` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `x` has decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
