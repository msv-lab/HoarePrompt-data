### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by constructing an array such that the number of increasing subsequences in the array equals a given number \( X \). The approach seems to derive from a binary representation of \( X \), using a mix of maximum and minimum values to create the subsequences.

However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Binary Representation Misinterpretation**: The program tries to create an array based on the binary representation of \( X \). It appends a maximum value when \( X \) is even and a minimum value when \( X \) is odd, then divides \( X \) by 2 or subtracts 1 accordingly. This approach does not correctly map to the number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Increasing Subsequences**: The problem requires the array to have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The binary representation approach does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will match \( X \). For example, the binary representation does not account for the specific order and values of elements needed to form exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

3. **Range and Constraints**: The program uses hardcoded values for `max` and `min` which are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), but the logic does not ensure that the array formed will have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

4. **Reversing the List**: The program reverses the list `ans` at the end, which might be intended to correct the order, but the underlying logic does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem of finding an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
