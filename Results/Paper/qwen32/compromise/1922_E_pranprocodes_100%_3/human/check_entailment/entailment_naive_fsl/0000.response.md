Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program attempts to solve the problem by using a binary representation of the number of increasing subsequences (X). However, there are several issues with the approach:

1. **Incorrect Use of Binary Representation**: The code tries to construct an array based on the binary representation of X, but it does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly X increasing subsequences. The problem requires a more sophisticated method to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Handling of Odd and Even Cases**: The code alternates between appending the maximum and minimum values to the array based on whether X is odd or even. However, this approach does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly X.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if X is a large number, the binary representation approach might not yield a valid array of length at most 200.

4. **Array Length Constraint**: The problem specifies that the length of the array should be at most 200. The current approach does not guarantee that the length of the array will be within this constraint.

5. **Output Format**: The code correctly prints the length of the array and the array itself, but the logic to generate the array is flawed.

To illustrate the issue, consider the input `X = 5`. The correct output could be:
```
3
0 1 0
```
This array has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[0, 1]`. However, the given program will not produce this output or any other valid array for `X = 5`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not guarantee to produce an array with exactly X increasing subsequences for all possible values of X within the given constraints.
