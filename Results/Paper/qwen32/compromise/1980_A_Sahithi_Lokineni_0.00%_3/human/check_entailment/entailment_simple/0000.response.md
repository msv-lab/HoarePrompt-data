Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Vlad wants to hold `m` rounds, each containing one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. Vlad already has `n` problems with varying difficulty levels. The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can hold `m` rounds.

2. **Logic**:
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', Vlad needs at least `m` problems.
   - Count the number of problems Vlad already has for each difficulty level.
   - For each difficulty level, if the count is less than `m`, Vlad needs to create `m - count` additional problems.
   - Sum up the additional problems needed for all difficulty levels.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the string `s` representing the existing problems.

2. **Counting Existing Problems**:
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the number of problems for each difficulty level.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates the count for each difficulty level.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems**:
   - The program iterates through the keys of the dictionary `d` (which represent the difficulty levels).
   - For each difficulty level, if the count is less than `m`, it adds `m - count` to the answer `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- The function `default_value()` is referenced in the `defaultdict` initialization but is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will cause a `NameError` at runtime.
- The function `func_1()` is defined but not used anywhere in the program. It seems to be a leftover from previous code and should be removed.

### Correctness:
Despite the issues mentioned, if the `default_value()` function were correctly defined to return `0`, the logic of the program would be correct. However, since the function is not defined, the program will not run as expected.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the undefined `default_value()` function.

**Correctness: False**
