Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of good subsegments of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` elements matching `b` when rearranged.
   
3. **Counter Initialization:**
   - `cb = Counter(sorted(b))`: This creates a counter for the elements in `b`. However, sorting `b` is unnecessary here because the counter will work correctly without sorting.
   - `ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))`: This creates a counter for the first subsegment of `a` of length `m`. Sorting `a[:m]` is also unnecessary.

4. **Initial Check:**
   - `sm = sum((ca & cb).values())`: This calculates the number of common elements between the first subsegment of `a` and `b`. The `&` operator on counters returns a new counter with the minimum counts of each element in both counters.
   - If `sm >= k`, it increments the `ans` by 1, indicating that the first subsegment is good.

5. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window and each element `a[r - m]` removed from the window, it updates the counter `ca` and the sum `sm` accordingly.
   - It checks if the new sum `sm` is greater than or equal to `k` and increments `ans` if true.

6. **Output:**
   - The function returns the count of good subsegments, which is printed for each test case.

### Issues and Corrections

- **Sorting Unnecessary:** Sorting `b` and `a[:m]` is unnecessary. The `Counter` will work correctly without sorting.
- **Correctness of Logic:** The logic of using a sliding window to update the count of common elements is correct. The program correctly updates the count of elements entering and leaving the window and checks if the condition `sm >= k` holds.

### Conclusion

The program is correct in terms of logic and handles the sliding window approach efficiently. The unnecessary sorting does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Correctness: **True**
