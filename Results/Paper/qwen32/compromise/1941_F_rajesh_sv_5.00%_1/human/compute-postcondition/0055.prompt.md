Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is a list returned by `func_4()` that must have at least one element, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `l` is the index in `D` where `left - f` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1` and `h` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged and `h` is updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` must be at least `mid + 2`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` must be at least `l + 1`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
