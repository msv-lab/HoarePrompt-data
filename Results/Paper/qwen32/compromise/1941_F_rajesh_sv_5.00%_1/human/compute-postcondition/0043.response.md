The variables in the loop head are `l` and `h`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `h`. If `l` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
- If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1` and `h` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged and `h` is updated to `mid`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `l` must be less than `h`. Given the update rules:
- If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, `l` is incremented, so `h` must be greater than the new `l`.
- If `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`, `h` is set to `mid`, so `l` must be less than the new `h`.

Since we need to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we should consider the scenario where `l` is incremented or `h` is decremented but still keeps `l < h`.

Let's assume the worst-case scenario where `l` is incremented by the maximum possible value, which is when `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1` is just less than `h`. This means `h` must be at least `l + 1`.

State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` must be at least `l + 1`**
