In the provided task, the for loop will execute based on the value of `testcases`. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and `testcases`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop. Therefore, the only variable we need to ensure is correctly set for the loop to execute is `testcases`.

Given that `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()`, and we know that `1 <= testcases <= 10^4`, we need to make sure that `testcases` falls within this range for the loop to execute.

Since the problem specifies that `testcases` will be within the range [1, 10^4], we don't need to adjust `testcases` further as long as it adheres to this constraint. However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `testcases` must be at least 1.

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` where `1 <= testcases <= 10^4`**
