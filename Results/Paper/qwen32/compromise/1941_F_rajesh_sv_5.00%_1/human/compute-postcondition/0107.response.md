Output State: **`l` is updated to `mid + 1` or remains the smallest index such that `D[l] > left - f` and `l < h`. `h` is now equal to `mid`. `mid` is now equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`. `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. Ensure `l < h` after updates.**

In simpler terms, the value of `h` has been updated to the current value of `mid`. The values of `l`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` are recalculated based on the new value of `h`, while ensuring that `l` remains less than `h`.
