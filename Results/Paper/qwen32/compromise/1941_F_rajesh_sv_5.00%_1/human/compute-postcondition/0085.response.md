Postcondition: **`l` and `h` are equal, representing the final index in `D`. `mid` is equal to `l` (or `h`). `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If the condition `l == h` is true, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.**
