The code snippet updates the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` based on the current values of `D[mid]`, `D[mid + 1]`, and `f`. The values of `l`, `h`, and `mid` remain unchanged. The conditions involving `left` and `right` are not affected by this code snippet, and the logic that updates `l` or `h` is not executed in this snippet.

Output State: **`l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `l < h - 1`, `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `D` must have at least two elements with `left - f` less than some element in `D` and `right - f` greater than some element in `D`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
