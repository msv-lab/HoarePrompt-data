The code calculates the midpoint `mid` between `l` and `h` using the formula `mid = l + (h - l) // 2`. This does not affect the values of `l` and `h`, but it does assign a new value to `mid`. The conditions on `l` and `h` remain valid after this operation.

Output State: **`l` is updated to `mid + 1` or remains the smallest index such that `D[l] > left - f` and `l < h`. `h` is updated to the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l` or remains equal to `mid`. `mid` is now equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`. Ensure `l < h` after updates.**
