Output State: **`A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`.**

In simple terms, the variable `ans` has been assigned the value of `max_diff`, which is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list `A`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
