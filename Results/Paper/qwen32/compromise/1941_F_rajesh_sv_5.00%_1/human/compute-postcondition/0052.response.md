Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` must be at least `l + 1`; `l` is `mid + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The values of `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, and the precondition that `h` must be at least `l + 1` remain unchanged.
