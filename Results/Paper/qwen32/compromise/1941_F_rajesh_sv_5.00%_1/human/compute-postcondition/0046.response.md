The code snippet `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` by setting it to `mid + 1`. The values of `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, and the condition `h must be at least l + 1` are not directly affected by this assignment, except that the condition now needs to be checked with the new value of `l`.

Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` must be at least `mid + 2`; `l` is `mid + 1`.**
