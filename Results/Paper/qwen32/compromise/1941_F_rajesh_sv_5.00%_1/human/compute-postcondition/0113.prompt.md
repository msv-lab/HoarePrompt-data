Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`.
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` and `h` are equal, representing the final index where the condition holds true; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` and `h` are equal, representing the final index in `D`. `mid` is equal to `l` (or `h`). `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If the condition `l == h` is true, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` and `h` are equal, `mid` is equal to `l` (or `h`), `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are recalculated based on the final `mid`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` remains the last value used in the loop, and the condition `l == h` is true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
