The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop will execute based on the value of `testcases`. At the end of the previous iteration, `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` where `1 <= testcases <= 10^4`. 

Since the loop variable `_` is not used, we only need to consider how `testcases` is used to determine if the loop should execute again. The loop will execute as long as `testcases` is greater than 0. After each iteration, the loop implicitly decrements `testcases` by 1 (since it is using `range(testcases)`).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 1, where `0 <= testcases - 1 <= 10^4 - 1`**
