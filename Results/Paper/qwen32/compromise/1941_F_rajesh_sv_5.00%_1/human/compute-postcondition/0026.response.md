The code snippet updates the value of `next_max_diff` to the value of `diff`. The value of `next_max_diff` is now equal to `A[5] - A[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n` is at least 4, `m` and `k` are values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `i` is 5, `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`, `next_max_diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`.**
