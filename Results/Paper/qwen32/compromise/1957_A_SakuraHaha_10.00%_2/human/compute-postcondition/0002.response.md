The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are modified or used in this snippet. Therefore, the state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of sticks available. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — the stick lengths. `n` is an integer read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `ans` is 0.**
