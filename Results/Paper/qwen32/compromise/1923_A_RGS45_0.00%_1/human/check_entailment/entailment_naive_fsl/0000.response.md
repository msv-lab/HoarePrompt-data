Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description to identify the issues.

#### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))
```

#### Issues:
1. **Input Parsing**: The input array `arr` is read as a string and not as a list of integers. This can cause issues when trying to manipulate or count elements.
2. **Finding the Range**: The variables `x` and `y` are used to find the first and last positions of the chips ('1'). However, the calculation `z = arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect. It does not correctly identify the range of cells between the first and last chip.
3. **Counting Operations**: The code counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, but it does not account for the actual movement of chips. The number of operations required is the sum of the distances each chip needs to move to form a contiguous block.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the positions of all chips.
2. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a contiguous block.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        chip_positions = [i for i in range(n) if arr[i] == 1]
        median_position = chip_positions[len(chip_positions) // 2]
        operations = sum(abs(pos - median_position) for pos in chip_positions)
        print(operations)

# Example usage
# func()
```

#### Explanation of the Correct Program:
1. **Input Parsing**: The input array `arr` is parsed as a list of integers.
2. **Chip Positions**: We collect the positions of all chips in the `chip_positions` list.
3. **Median Position**: The median position is chosen as the target position for the block of chips. This minimizes the total number of moves.
4. **Counting Operations**: The number of operations is calculated as the sum of the distances from each chip to the median position.

This corrected program should handle all edge cases and provide the correct minimum number of operations for each test case.
