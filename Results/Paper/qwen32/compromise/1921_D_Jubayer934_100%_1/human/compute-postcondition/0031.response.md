Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is either -1 or the index `i` where the loop broke, `ans` is a list of `min(n, i+1)` absolute differences, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, and `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order. If `temp` is not -1, then `temp` is the index `i` where the loop broke, `n` is greater than `temp`, and `ans` is a list of `n` absolute differences. If `temp` is -1, then no specific changes are made to `n` or `ans` beyond their initial definitions.**
