The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `n` and `m`, but it tells us that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and that `t` is the input to the loop. The value of `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
