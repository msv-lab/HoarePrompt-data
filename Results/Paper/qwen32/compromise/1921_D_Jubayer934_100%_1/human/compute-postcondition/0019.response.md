The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `temp`. It only exits the nearest enclosing loop or `switch` statement. Therefore, the values of `i` and `temp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `temp` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
