The code appends a new value to the list `ans`. This new value is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `temp + 1`, so the new value being appended is `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the number of elements in list `a` and must be greater than `temp`, `m` is the number of elements in list `b`, `temp` is an index such that 0 <= temp < n, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` from 0 to `temp-1` and now also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `temp + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `temp + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the list `ans` now includes one more element, which is the absolute difference between the element at index `temp + 1` in list `a` and the element at index `-(n - (temp + 1))` in list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
