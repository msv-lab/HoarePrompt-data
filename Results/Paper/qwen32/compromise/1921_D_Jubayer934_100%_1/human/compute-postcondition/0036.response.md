The given code snippet reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list. This means the previous value of `ans`, which was a list of `min(n, i+1)` absolute differences, is now discarded and `ans` is reset to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `temp` is -1, `ans` is [], `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, and `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**
