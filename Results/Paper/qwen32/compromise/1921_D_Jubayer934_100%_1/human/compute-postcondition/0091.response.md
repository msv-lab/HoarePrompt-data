Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer such that 0 <= temp < n, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences calculated up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations, including the new value `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order.**

In simpler terms, the new absolute difference `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` has been appended to the list `ans`. All other variables retain their previous values.
