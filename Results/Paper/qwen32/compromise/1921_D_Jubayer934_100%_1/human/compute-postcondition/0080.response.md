Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
