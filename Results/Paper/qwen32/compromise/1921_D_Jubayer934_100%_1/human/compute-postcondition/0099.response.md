Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `m` are the lengths of the lists `a` and `b` respectively. `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order. `temp` is either -1 or the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was met during the inner loop. `ans` is a list of absolute differences calculated as follows: for each index `i` from 0 to `temp-1`, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[i])`. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for each index `i` from `temp` to `n-1`. The final output for each test case is the sum of all elements in `ans`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop has processed `t` test cases. For each test case, it calculates the sum of absolute differences between elements of two lists `a` and `b`, following specific rules, and prints this sum.
