Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the number of elements in list `a`, `m` is the number of elements in list `b`, `temp` is an index such that 0 <= temp <= n (if a break occurred, `temp` is the index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was met, otherwise `temp` is -1), `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` from 0 to `temp-1`, and if a break occurred, it also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**
