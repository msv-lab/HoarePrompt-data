Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `temp` remains unchanged, `a` remains sorted, and `b` remains sorted in descending order. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` will have `n - temp` additional elements, each being `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` ranging from `temp` to `n-1`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` remains unchanged.**
