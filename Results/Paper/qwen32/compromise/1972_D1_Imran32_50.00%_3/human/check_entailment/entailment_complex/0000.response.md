### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

However, the code provided does not correctly address this problem. Instead, it appears to be calculating a different quantity, specifically:
\[ \text{ans} = n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{root}} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor \]
where \(\text{root} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor + 1\).

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code and compare it with the problem statement.

The provided code does not involve:
- Reading the second integer \(m\) for each test case.
- Calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\).
- Checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Instead, it performs a summation based on the value of \(n\) alone, which is unrelated to the conditions specified in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not solve the given problem correctly. It calculates a completely different quantity and does not take into account the conditions involving \(b\) and \(\gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
