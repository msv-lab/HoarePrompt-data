The loop in the provided code iterates over a range defined by `t`. The loop variable is `_`, which is a common convention in Python when the loop variable is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Since the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 already guarantees that `t` is at least 1, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Here is the state before the loop starts, considering only the variables in the loop head:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500**
