The code snippet `r.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the end of the list `r`. The initial state only specifies that `bx` is greater than `ax`, which does not affect the list `r` or any other variable directly mentioned in the code snippet.

Output State: **`bx` is greater than `ax`; `r` has an additional element `0` appended to it.**
