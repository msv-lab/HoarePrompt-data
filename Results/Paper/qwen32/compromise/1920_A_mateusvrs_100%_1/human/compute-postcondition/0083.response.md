The code snippet provided appends the value `0` to the list `r`. This operation does not affect the variables `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `t` is at least 1, and `n` is the number of iterations. Additionally, `bx` is greater than `ax`, and `r` now contains an additional element `0`.**
