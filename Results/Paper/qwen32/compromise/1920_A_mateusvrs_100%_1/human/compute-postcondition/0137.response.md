Postcondition: **`bx` is the maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`, `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3` that must have at least one element, `t` is `t - n`, `n` is 0, `r` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is 1 if the first element in `cx` satisfies `i >= bx` and `i <= ax`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.**
