Output State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`, and `bx > ax`. `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3`. `t` is `t - n`, `n` is 0, and `r` remains unchanged except that `0` is appended to it.**

In simple terms, the value of `r` has been updated to include `0` at the end of the list, while all other variables retain their previous values.
