The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Let's analyze the impact:

- If `a` is 1 or 2, `cx` was initially an empty set. After adding `x`, `cx` will be a set containing `x`.
- If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` was initially a set containing `x`. Adding `x` again will not change `cx` since sets do not allow duplicate elements.

Given these points, the output state will be:

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1.**
