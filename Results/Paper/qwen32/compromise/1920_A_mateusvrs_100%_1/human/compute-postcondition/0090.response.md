The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the set `cx`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the set `cx`. If there are more elements in `cx`, the loop can execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was an element from the set `cx`, and `cx` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must still have elements remaining after the last iteration. Since `i` takes on the value of each element in `cx` one by one, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `cx`.

State: **`bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 and must have at least 1 element, `t` is at least 1, `n` is the number of iterations. `i` is the next element in `cx`.**
