The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and its current value. Let's consider the different initial conditions for `ax` based on the value of `a`:

1. If `a` is 1 or `a` is not 2, `ax` is initially set to 1000000007. After the code execution, `ax` will be `min(x, 1000000007)`.
2. If `a` is 2, `ax` is initially set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. After the code execution, `ax` will be `min(x, min(x, 1000000007))`, which simplifies to `min(x, 1000000007)`.

In both cases, the value of `ax` after the code execution is `min(x, 1000000007)`. The other variables (`a`, `x`, `bx`, `t`, `n`, `cx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`, `t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
