The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx` and the current value of `i`. If `cx` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element of `cx` assigned to `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the current element from `cx`, and `cx` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must have at least one more element. The next value of `i` will be the next element from `cx`.

State: **`bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 and must have at least 2 elements, `t` is at least 1, `n` is the number of iterations, `i` is the next element in `cx`. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, `tmp` is incremented by 1.**
