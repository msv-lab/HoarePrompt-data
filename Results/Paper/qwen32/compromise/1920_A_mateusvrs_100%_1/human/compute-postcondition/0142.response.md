The code snippet provided is `tmp += 1`, which increments the value of the variable `tmp` by 1. 

Based on the initial state provided:
- `bx` is the maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`
- `ax` is the minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`
- `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3` that must have at least one element
- `t` is `t - n`
- `n` is 0
- `r` remains unchanged
- `tmp` is 1 if the first element in `cx` satisfies `i >= bx` and `i <= ax`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0, and `i` is another element from `cx` if it exists. If `i >= bx` and `i <= ax`, `tmp` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is `i_new`, where `i_new` is another element from `cx`.

Since the code only modifies `tmp` by incrementing it by 1, the output state will only reflect this change. The values of `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `t`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged.

If `tmp` was initially 0, it will now be 1. If `tmp` was initially 1, it will now be 2, and so on.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`, `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3` that must have at least one element, `t` is `t - n`, `n` is 0, `r` remains unchanged, `tmp` is incremented by 1, and `i` is `i_new`, where `i_new` is another element from `cx`.**
