Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each of the t test cases starts with an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Following n lines describe the constraints for each test case, where each line contains two integers a and x, where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. a=1 means k must be greater than or equal to x, a=2 means k must be less than or equal to x, and a=3 means k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.**
