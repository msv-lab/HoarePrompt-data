Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the price of one yogurt `a`, and the price of two yogurts on promotion `b`.
3. It then determines the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts:
   - If `n` is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts separately (2 * a) is cheaper than the promotion price `b`. If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price. Otherwise, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and buys the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
   - If `n` is even, it again checks if buying two yogurts separately (2 * a) is cheaper than the promotion price `b`. If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price. Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.

Let's verify this logic with the example provided in the problem:

1. For `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`:
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9), which is false. So, it buys both yogurts at the promotion price, resulting in `9` burles.

2. For `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`:
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9), which is false. So, it buys one pair of yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price, resulting in `9 + 5 = 14` burles.

3. For `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`:
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11), which is true. So, it buys all yogurts at the regular price, resulting in `5 * 3 = 15` burles.

4. For `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`:
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11), which is true. So, it buys all yogurts at the regular price, resulting in `5 * 4 = 20` burles.

The program's logic seems to correctly compute the minimum cost for each test case as per the examples provided.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
