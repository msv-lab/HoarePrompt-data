The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions. The conditions are: print 'Yes' if `n` equals `m`, if `m` is exactly one less than `n`, or if both `n` and `m` are either even or odd. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not modify `t` or any other input variables beyond using them to determine the output for each test case.
