Reasoning: 
The provided program checks if it's possible for Nikita to have a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. If `n == m`, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can simply add one cube at a time until the tower has `m` cubes.
2. If `m > n`, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot have more cubes than the number of moves since each move can only add or remove one cube.
3. If `m == n - 1`, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can add one cube `n-1` times and then remove one cube, resulting in `m` cubes.
4. If both `n` and `m` are either even or odd, it prints 'Yes'. This condition is based on the observation that the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of cubes can be maintained or changed by an even number of moves, but not by an odd number of moves. Specifically, starting from 0 cubes (an even number), after an even number of moves, the number of cubes will still be even, and after an odd number of moves, the number of cubes will be odd. Thus, if `n` and `m` have the same parity, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
5. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'.

The logic in the program correctly covers all the scenarios described in the problem statement, ensuring that the output is accurate for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
