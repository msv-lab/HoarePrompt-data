Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step to determine the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Breakdown

Nikita starts with 0 cubes and can either add or remove 1 cube per move. We need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Points
1. **If `m > n`**: Impossible because each move can add at most 1 cube.
2. **If `n == m`**: Possible because Nikita can add 1 cube in each of the `n` moves.
3. **If `m == n - 1`**: Possible because Nikita can add 1 cube in each of the `n` moves except for one move where he removes a cube.
4. **If `m < n - 1`**: Possible if the net addition of cubes equals `m`. This can be achieved by a combination of adding and removing cubes. The parity of `m` and `n` does not directly determine the possibility unless `m` is `n-1` or `m > n`.

### Program Analysis

The program checks the following conditions:
- `if n == m`: Prints "Yes".
- `elif m > n`: Prints "No".
- `elif m == n - 1`: Prints "Yes".
- `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`: Prints "Yes".
- `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`: Prints "Yes".
- `else`: Prints "No".

### Issues with the Program

The last two conditions (`m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`) are incorrect. They do not account for all valid cases where `m < n - 1`.

For example:
- If `n = 5` and `m = 1`, the program will print "No" because `m` and `n` have different parities. However, it is possible to achieve this by adding 1 cube 3 times and removing 1 cube 2 times.

### Correct Conditions

The correct conditions should be:
- `if n == m`: Prints "Yes".
- `elif m > n`: Prints "No".
- `elif m == n - 1`: Prints "Yes".
- `elif m < n - 1`: Prints "Yes" if the difference `n - m` is even (since an even number of removals and additions can balance out to the desired `m`).

### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the last two conditions in the program are incorrect. The program does not correctly handle all cases where `m < n - 1`.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of cases where `m < n - 1`.
