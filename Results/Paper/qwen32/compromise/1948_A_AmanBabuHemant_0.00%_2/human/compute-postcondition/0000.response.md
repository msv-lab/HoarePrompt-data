The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50. After executing the code, the value of `t` is set to the integer provided by the input, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50.**
