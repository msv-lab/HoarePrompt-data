The given Python code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` using the `math.gcd` function. The variables `p` and `q` are already defined in the initial state, and their values are based on the inputs and calculations described.

Let's determine the new state after executing the `gcd = math.gcd(p, q)` line:

- `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `p`, and `q` retain their values from the initial state.
- A new variable `gcd` is introduced, which holds the GCD of `p` and `q`.

Since the exact values of `p` and `q` depend on the input integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the sum of `f` values, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `gcd`. However, we know that `gcd` will be an integer that divides both `p` and `q` without leaving a remainder.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the values read during the last iteration, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * cn2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
