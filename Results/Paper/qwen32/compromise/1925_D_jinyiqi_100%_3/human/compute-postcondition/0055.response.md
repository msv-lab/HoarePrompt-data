The given code snippet recalculates the value of `cn2` using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This means that the value of `cn2` will be updated based on the current value of `n`.

Given that `cn2` was initially calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, executing the same calculation again does not change its value unless `n` has changed. Since there is no indication that `n` has changed before this line, `cn2` remains the same.

Therefore, the only variable that could potentially change is `cn2`, but since the calculation does not alter its value, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to `cn2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the values read during the last iteration, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
