The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. This means the values of `a`, `b`, and `f` will be updated based on the new input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `f`, `a` is the first of the new input integers, `b` is the second of the new input integers, `f` is the third of the new input integers, `j` is 1**

Natural Language: The variables `a`, `b`, and `f` are updated to the values of the three integers read from the input. All other variables retain their initial values.
