The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `sum_f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is 0, `a` is the first of the new input integers, `b` is the second of the new input integers, `f` is the third of the new input integers.**
