The provided code snippet only assigns a constant value to the variable `M`. It does not modify any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`). Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `M` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5; each of the next `m` lines contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, where `a_i` ≠ `b_i`, 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `f_i` ≤ 10^9; all pairs (`a_i`, `b_i`) are distinct; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5; the sum of `k` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `M` is 10 ** 9 + 7.**
