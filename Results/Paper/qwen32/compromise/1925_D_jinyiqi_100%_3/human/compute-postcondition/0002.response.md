In the given task, the for loop iterates over the variable `i` from `0` to `t-1`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least `1` because the range function in Python generates numbers from `0` up to but not including `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an input integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4`, the variable `t` already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute since it is guaranteed to be at least `1`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The state of `t` is sufficient as it stands.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0**
