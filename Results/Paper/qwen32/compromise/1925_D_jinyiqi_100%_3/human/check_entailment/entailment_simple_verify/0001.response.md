### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided solution's formula is incorrect. Let's delve deeper into why the formula used in the program does not accurately compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values over k excursions.

#### Problem Recap

- **Initial Setup:** We have `n` children and `m` pairs of friends with given friendship values.
- **Excursions:** The teacher randomly selects pairs of children for `k` excursions. If a selected pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for future selections.
- **Objective:** Compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values at the time of selection for all `k` excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Issues with the Provided Formula

The provided solution uses the following formula for the numerator \(p\) and denominator \(q\):

- **Numerator (p):** \(2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)\)
- **Denominator (q):** \(2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2\)

Let's break down why these formulas are problematic:

1. **Initial Friendship Contribution:**
   - The term \(2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f}\) suggests that the initial friendship values contribute linearly to the expected sum over `k` excursions. However, this term does not correctly account for the fact that the probability of selecting a specific friend pair changes as their friendship value increases.
   
2. **Additional Increase Contribution:**
   - The term \(m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)\) attempts to account for the additional increase in friendship values due to repeated selections of the same friend pairs. However, this term also does not accurately reflect the probabilistic nature of the problem, as it assumes a uniform increase without considering the changing probabilities.

#### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve:

1. **Dynamic Programming or Probabilistic Analysis:**
   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the expected friendship values for each pair over the `k` excursions.
   - Alternatively, use probabilistic analysis to compute the expected contributions of each pair based on their current friendship values and the probabilities of being selected.

2. **Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - Properly account for the changing probabilities of selecting each pair as their friendship values increase.

Given the complexity of the problem, the provided solution's formula is insufficient and does not accurately compute the expected value. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in identifying the solution as incorrect.
