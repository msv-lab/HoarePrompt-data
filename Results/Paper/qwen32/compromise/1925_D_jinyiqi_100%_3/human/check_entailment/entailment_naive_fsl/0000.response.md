Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   The formula used in the program to compute `p` and `q` is incorrect. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting a friend pair versus a non-friend pair and how the friendship values evolve over the k excursions.

2. **Handling of Friendship Values**:
   The program simply sums up the initial friendship values and uses them in a way that does not reflect the dynamic nature of friendship values increasing over excursions. Specifically, the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen, which needs to be factored into the expected value calculation.

3. **Probability Considerations**:
   The probability of choosing a friend pair in any given excursion is `m / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`, and the probability of choosing a non-friend pair is `(n * (n - 1) / 2 - m) / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. These probabilities need to be used to correctly compute the expected value.

Here is a simplified explanation of the correct approach:
- For each friend pair, calculate the expected contribution to the sum of friendship values over k excursions.
- For each non-friend pair, the expected contribution is 0 initially but changes as the friendship value increases.
- Use these contributions to compute the overall expected value and convert it to the required modular inverse form.

Given these issues, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and will not produce the correct results for all potential cases.
