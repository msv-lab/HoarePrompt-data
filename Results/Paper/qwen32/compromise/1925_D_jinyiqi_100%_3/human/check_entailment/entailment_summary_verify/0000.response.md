To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the problem description and compare it with the implementation details and the function summary.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
2. **Inputs**:
   - Number of children (`n`)
   - Number of friend pairs (`m`)
   - Number of excursions (`k`)
   - List of friend pairs with their initial friendship values.
3. **Output**: The expected value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem using the following steps:
1. **Read Input**: It reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friend pairs.
2. **Sum Initial Friendship Values**: It calculates the sum of initial friendship values (`sum_f`).
3. **Calculate Combinations**: It calculates the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n` (`cn2`).
4. **Compute `p` and `q`**:
   - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
   - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`
5. **Simplify Fraction**: It simplifies the fraction `p/q` by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
6. **Modular Inverse**: It computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and multiplies it by `p` to get the final result.

### Issues in the Provided Program

1. **Incorrect Formula**:
   - The formula used for `p` and `q` does not accurately reflect the expected value calculation. The expected value should consider the probability of selecting a friend pair and the dynamic increase in friendship values over excursions.
   
2. **Dynamic Nature of Friendship Values**:
   - The program does not account for the fact that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen. This dynamic change needs to be incorporated into the expected value calculation.

3. **Probability Considerations**:
   - The probability of choosing a friend pair in any given excursion is `m / cn2`, and the probability of choosing a non-friend pair is `(cn2 - m) / cn2`. These probabilities need to be used to correctly compute the expected value.

### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve:
1. **Expected Contribution of Friend Pairs**:
   - For each friend pair, calculate the expected contribution to the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions. This involves considering the probability of choosing the pair and the increasing friendship value.
   
2. **Expected Contribution of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - Initially, non-friend pairs contribute 0 to the sum. However, as the friendship value of friend pairs increases, the probability of choosing a non-friend pair also changes.

3. **Overall Expected Value**:
   - Sum the expected contributions from all pairs and convert the result to the required modular inverse form.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
