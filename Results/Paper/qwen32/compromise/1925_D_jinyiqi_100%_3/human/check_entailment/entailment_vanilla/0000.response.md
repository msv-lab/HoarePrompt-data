Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. This expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Key Points:
1. **Initial Friendship Values:** We are given initial friendship values for some pairs.
2. **Random Selection:** Pairs are selected randomly with replacement for k excursions.
3. **Friendship Value Update:** If a selected pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for future selections.
4. **Expected Value Calculation:** We need to calculate the expected sum of friendship values at the time of selection for all k excursions.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to compute the expected value using a formula derived from the problem statement. Let's break down the key steps:

1. **Reading Input:** The solution reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:** For each test case, it sums up the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.
3. **Calculating Combinations:** It calculates the number of ways to choose any two children out of n, which is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
4. **Computing Numerator (p) and Denominator (q):**
   - Numerator \(p\) is calculated as \(2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)\).
   - Denominator \(q\) is calculated as \(2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2\).
5. **Simplifying the Fraction:** The solution simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
6. **Modular Inverse:** Finally, it computes the modular inverse of the simplified denominator modulo \(10^9+7\) and multiplies it with the simplified numerator to get the result.

### Verification

Let's verify if the formula used in the solution is correct:

- **Numerator (p):** The term \(2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f}\) accounts for the contribution of the initial friendship values over k excursions. The term \(m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)\) accounts for the additional increase in friendship values due to repeated selections of the same friend pairs.
- **Denominator (q):** The term \(2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2\) represents the total number of possible outcomes for selecting pairs over k excursions, considering the equiprobability and independence of selections.

However, the formula provided in the solution seems incorrect. Specifically, the term \(2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f}\) does not accurately represent the expected contribution of the initial friendship values. The correct approach involves more complex combinatorial calculations and possibly dynamic programming to account for the evolving friendship values over multiple excursions.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided solution does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Therefore, the correctness of the solution is:

Correctness: **False**
