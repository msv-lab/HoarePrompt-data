The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `ans` to 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `k`, `sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`, `s`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is decremented by 1, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is an input string, `ans` is 0**.
