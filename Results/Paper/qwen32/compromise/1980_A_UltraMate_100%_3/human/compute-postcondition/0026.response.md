The code snippet `ans += m - hmp[i]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to it. 

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is `k * m + 2m - 2hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`, otherwise `ans` is `k * m + m - hmp[i]`.
- `hmp` must contain at least one key-value pair.
- `i` is the next key in `hmp`.

After the execution of the code, the new value of `ans` will be:
- If `hmp[i] < m`, the new `ans` will be `(k * m + 2m - 2hmp[i]) + (m - hmp[i]) = k * m + 3m - 3hmp[i]`.
- If `hmp[i] >= m`, the new `ans` will be `(k * m + m - hmp[i]) + (m - hmp[i]) = k * m + 2m - 2hmp[i]`.

So, the output state will be:
- `ans` is `k * m + 3m - 3hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`, otherwise `ans` is `k * m + 2m - 2hmp[i]`.
- `hmp` must contain at least one key-value pair.
- `i` is the next key in `hmp`.

Output State: **`ans` is `k * m + 3m - 3hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`, otherwise `ans` is `k * m + 2m - 2hmp[i]`; `hmp` must contain at least one key-value pair; `i` is the next key in `hmp`.**
