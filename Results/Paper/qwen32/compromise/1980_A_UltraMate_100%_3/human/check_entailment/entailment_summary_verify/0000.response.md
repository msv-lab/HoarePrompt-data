### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, program code, and function summary.

#### Problem Understanding:
- Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each containing one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
- Vlad has `n` problems, each with a specific difficulty level.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to satisfy the requirement for `m` rounds.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds), followed by a string `s` representing the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems**:
   - **Missing Levels**: For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', if the level is not present in the `Counter`, the program adds `m` to `ans` because all `m` rounds need a problem of that level.
   - **Insufficient Count**: For each difficulty level present in the `Counter`, if the count is less than `m`, the program adds the difference (`m - count`) to `ans`, indicating that more problems of that level are needed to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function summary accurately describes the logic of the program. It correctly identifies the need to account for both missing difficulty levels and insufficient counts for existing levels.

#### Evaluation Against Problem Description:
- **Missing Levels**: If a difficulty level is entirely missing, the program correctly adds `m` to `ans` because all `m` rounds need a problem of that level.
- **Insufficient Count**: If a difficulty level is present but does not meet the requirement of `m` problems, the program correctly adds the difference to `ans`.
- **All Levels Covered and Sufficient Count**: If the bank has at least `m` problems of each level, the program should output `0`, which it does correctly.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **No Problems in the Bank**: If `n=0`, the program should output `7*m` because all levels from 'A' to 'G' need `m` problems each. The program handles this correctly.
  - **All Problems of the Same Level**: If all problems in the bank have the same difficulty level, the program should output `6*m` because only one level is covered, and the remaining six levels need `m` problems each. The program handles this correctly.
  - **All Levels Covered but Insufficient Count**: If the bank has problems of all levels but fewer than `m` for some levels, the program correctly calculates the additional problems needed.
  - **All Levels Covered and Sufficient Count**: If the bank has at least `m` problems of each level, the program should output `0`. The program handles this correctly.
