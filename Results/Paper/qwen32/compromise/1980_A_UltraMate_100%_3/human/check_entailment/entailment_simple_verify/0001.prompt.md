You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the provided description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (the number of problems in the bank) and `m` (the number of rounds).
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` representing the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating the Number of Additional Problems:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `0`, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over each difficulty level in the string `'ABCDEFG'`:
     - If a difficulty level is not present in the `Counter` (i.e., `i not in hmp`), it adds `m` to `ans` because all `m` rounds need at least one problem of that difficulty.
     - If a difficulty level is present but its count is less than `m` (i.e., `hmp[i] < m`), it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans` to ensure each round has a problem of that difficulty.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of additional problems needed.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10 1 BGECDCBDED`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Calculation:
    - Counter: `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
    - Missing difficulties: `A`, `F`
    - Additional problems needed: `2` (one for `A` and one for `F`)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `10 2 BGECDCBDED`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Calculation:
    - Counter: `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
    - Missing difficulties: `A`, `F`
    - Additional problems needed for `A`: `2`
    - Additional problems needed for `F`: `2`
    - Additional problems needed for `C`: `1`
    - Total: `5`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `9 1 BBCDEFFGG`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Calculation:
    - Counter: `{'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
    - Missing difficulties: `A`
    - Additional problems needed: `1` (for `A`)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the provided example. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.
