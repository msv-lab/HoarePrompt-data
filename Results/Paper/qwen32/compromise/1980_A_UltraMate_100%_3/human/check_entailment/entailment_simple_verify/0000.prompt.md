You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Program Analysis
The program is designed to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to hold `m` rounds. Each round must contain one problem of each difficulty level 'A' through 'G'. The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the given problems.

### Key Steps in the Program
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of problems in the bank) and `m` (the number of upcoming rounds), and then reads a string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - For each difficulty level 'A' to 'G', if the level is not present in the `Counter` (i.e., the bank does not have any problems of that level), the program adds `m` to the answer because all `m` rounds need a problem of that level.
   - For each difficulty level present in the `Counter`, if the count is less than `m`, the program adds the difference (`m - count`) to the answer, indicating that more problems of that level are needed to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.

### Evaluation Against Problem Description
The program should correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case. Let's verify if the program handles all edge cases and potential scenarios.

#### Edge Cases
1. **No Problems in the Bank**: If `n=0`, the program should output `7*m` because all levels from 'A' to 'G' need `m` problems each.
2. **All Problems of the Same Level**: If all problems in the bank have the same difficulty level, the program should output `6*m` because only one level is covered, and the remaining six levels need `m` problems each.
3. **All Levels Covered but Insufficient Count**: If the bank has problems of all levels but fewer than `m` for some levels, the program should correctly calculate the additional problems needed.
4. **All Levels Covered and Sufficient Count**: If the bank has at least `m` problems of each level, the program should output `0`.

### Testing with Example Inputs
Let's test the program with the provided example inputs to see if it works as expected.

#### Example Input
```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
10 2
BGECDCBDED
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```

#### Expected Output
```
2
5
1
```

#### Program Output
Running the provided program with the above input, we get the expected output.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program and testing it with various scenarios, it appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case. The program handles edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation
The program correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level and calculates the number of additional problems needed for each round. It handles cases where some difficulty levels are missing entirely and where the count of some levels is less than the required number of rounds. The program has been tested with various inputs, including edge cases, and produces the expected output.
