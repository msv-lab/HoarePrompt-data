Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the provided description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (the number of problems in the bank) and `m` (the number of rounds).
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` representing the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating the Number of Additional Problems:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `0`, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over each difficulty level in the string `'ABCDEFG'`:
     - If a difficulty level is not present in the `Counter` (i.e., `i not in hmp`), it adds `m` to `ans` because all `m` rounds need at least one problem of that difficulty.
     - If a difficulty level is present but its count is less than `m` (i.e., `hmp[i] < m`), it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans` to ensure each round has a problem of that difficulty.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of additional problems needed.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10 1 BGECDCBDED`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Calculation:
    - Counter: `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
    - Missing difficulties: `A`, `F`
    - Additional problems needed: `2` (one for `A` and one for `F`)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `10 2 BGECDCBDED`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Calculation:
    - Counter: `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
    - Missing difficulties: `A`, `F`
    - Additional problems needed for `A`: `2`
    - Additional problems needed for `F`: `2`
    - Additional problems needed for `C`: `1`
    - Total: `5`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `9 1 BBCDEFFGG`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Calculation:
    - Counter: `{'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
    - Missing difficulties: `A`
    - Additional problems needed: `1` (for `A`)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the provided example. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
