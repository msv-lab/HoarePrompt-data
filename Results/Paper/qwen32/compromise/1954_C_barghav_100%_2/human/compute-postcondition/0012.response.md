Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two strings `a` and `b` of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It ensures that `a` is not lexicographically less than `b` by potentially swapping digits between `a` and `b` under certain conditions. After processing, it prints the modified string `a` followed by the modified string `b`, each on a new line. The input values `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged throughout the execution.**
