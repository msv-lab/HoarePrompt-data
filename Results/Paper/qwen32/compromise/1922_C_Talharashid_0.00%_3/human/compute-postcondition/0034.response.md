The code snippet provided only increments the `start` variable by `inc`, which is set to 1. Therefore, `start` will be incremented by 1, and no other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is less than `end` and is now `start + 1`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `mini` equals the minimum of its current value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`, `d1[start]` is set based on the conditions involving `mini` and `s`, and `s` is updated accordingly.**
