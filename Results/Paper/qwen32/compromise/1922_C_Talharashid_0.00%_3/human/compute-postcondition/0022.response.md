Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1. If `mini` was equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` remains 0. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, and `abs(lst[0] - lst[-1])` if applicable, and `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` in the else case.**
