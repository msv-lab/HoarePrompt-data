Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and the key `start` has the value `s`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with at least 3 elements; `start` is 1; `end` is `len(lst) - 1` which is at least 2; `inc` is 1; `m` is the total number of iterations that have been executed; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`. If `start + 1 < len(lst)`, then `mini` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.**
