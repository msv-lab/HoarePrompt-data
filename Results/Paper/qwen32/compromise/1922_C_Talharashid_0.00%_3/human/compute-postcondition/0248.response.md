The code snippet provided updates the value of `s1` based on the difference between the values of `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`. Since the code does not modify any other variables, we only need to update `s1` in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t + 1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from `len(lst) - 2` down to `0` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` and `end` are the two integers read from the new input minus 1, with `start` now being `start - 1`; `inc` is `-1`; `m` must be greater than 0; `s` is 0; `end` is `end - 1`; `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`.**

Natural language: The value of `s1` is now the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
