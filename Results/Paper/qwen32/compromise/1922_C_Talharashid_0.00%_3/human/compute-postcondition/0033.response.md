Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1. If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `d1[start]` is set to `s+1` and `s` is updated accordingly based on the conditions involving `start-1` and `start+1`. Otherwise, `d1[start]` remains `s` and `s` is updated by adding `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`. In both cases, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`.**
