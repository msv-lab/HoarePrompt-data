Postcondition: **`start` is less than `end`. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`, and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` if `start - 1` is greater than -1, otherwise `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`. If `start - 1` is not greater than -1, then `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. If `mini` equals the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**
