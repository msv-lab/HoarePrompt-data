The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time. According to the loop, `i` ranges from 0 to `m-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0. For the next iteration to occur, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Here are the steps to determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
1. `i` is the only variable that can be adjusted in the loop head.
2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 0.
3. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to become 1.

The other variables (`t`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `start`, `end`, `inc`, `m`, `s`, `s1`, `s2`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 1; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is decreased by 1; `end` are the integers read from the input minus 1; `inc` is -1; `m` must be greater than 0; `s` is 0; if `start` is less than `end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
