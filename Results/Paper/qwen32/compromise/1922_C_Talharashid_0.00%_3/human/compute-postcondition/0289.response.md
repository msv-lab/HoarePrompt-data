Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes the key-value pair `d1[start] = s`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` is 1; `m` is the number of iterations; `mini` is 11111111; `start` is less than `end - 1` and `start` has been incremented by `inc`; If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is either 2 or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]) + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`. `d1[start]` is `s`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `mini` has been explicitly set to 11111111. All other variables retain their previous values and states as described in the initial state.
