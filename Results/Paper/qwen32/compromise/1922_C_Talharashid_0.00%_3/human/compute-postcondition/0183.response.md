Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is `len(lst) - 1`; `s` is 0; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`. Additionally, `start - 1` is greater than -1; if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, then `mini` is set to the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**
