Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 2; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is the integer read from the input minus 2; `end` is the integer read from the input minus 2; `inc` is -1; `m` must be greater than 0; `s` is 0; `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`; `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.**

In this output state, the value of `s2` has been updated to `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
