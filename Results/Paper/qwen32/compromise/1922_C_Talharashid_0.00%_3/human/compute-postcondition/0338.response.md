Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes the key-value pair `d2[start] = s`; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 3`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is the number of iterations; `mini` is the minimum value between the previous `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is also the minimum value between the updated `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. If `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**
