Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with at least 2 elements; `start` is 0; `end` is `len(lst) - 1` which is at least 1; `inc` is 1; `m` is the total number of iterations that have been executed; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` (if `start - 1` is greater than -1) and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` (if `start + 1 < len(lst)`), with 11111111 as the default value where applicable.**
