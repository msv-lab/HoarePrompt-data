To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head. The loop head condition is `start != end`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`
- `d1` is a `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration
- `d2` is a `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0 and `d2[start]` is `s`
- `n` is an input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1
- `start` is `len(lst) - 2` (which is at least 0)
- `end` is `0`
- `inc` is -1
- `mini` is calculated based on the conditions provided

The loop condition is `start != end`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `start` and `end` such that `start` is not equal to `end`.

Since `end` is `0` and `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, which is at least `0`, we need to ensure that `start` is not `0`. If `start` is `0`, the loop will terminate. Therefore, we need to adjust `start` to be any value other than `0`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d2[start]` is `s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` must be greater than 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1**
