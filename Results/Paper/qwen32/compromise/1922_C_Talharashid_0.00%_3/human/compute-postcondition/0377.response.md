To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and deduce the values of `s1` and `s2`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `d1` is a `defaultdict` with default integer value 0, containing key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`.
- `d2` is a `defaultdict` with default integer value 0, containing key-value pairs `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 1.
- `n` is an integer read from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`.
- `start` is an integer read from the input minus 2.
- `end` is an integer read from the input minus 2.
- `inc` is -1.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `s` is 0.
- If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.
- Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.

### Analysis:
The key to understanding the output is to determine the values of `s1` and `s2`. These values depend on the `defaultdict`s `d1` and `d2`.

- `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`.
- `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 1.

Since `s` is initialized to 0 and does not change, both `d1` and `d2` will have all their values set to 0. Therefore, for any `start` and `end`:
- `d1[end] - d1[start] = 0 - 0 = 0`
- `d2[start] - d2[end] = 0 - 0 = 0`

Thus:
- `s1` will be `abs(0 - 0) = 0` if `start` is less than `end`, or `abs(0 - 0) = 0` if `start` is not less than `end`.
- `s2` will be `abs(0 - 0) = 0` if `start` is less than `end`, or `abs(0 - 0) = 0` if `start` is not less than `end`.

In both cases, `s1` and `s2` will be 0.

### Conclusion:
Since `s1` and `s2` are both 0, the minimum of `s1` and `s2` will also be 0.

Output: **0**
