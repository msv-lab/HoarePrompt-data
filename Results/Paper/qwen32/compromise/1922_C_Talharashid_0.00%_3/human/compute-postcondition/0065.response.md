Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is `len(lst) - 2` (which is at least 0), `end` is `0`, `inc` is -1. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. In both cases, `mini` is the minimum of `11111111` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains `11111111`.**

In simpler terms, `start` has been decremented by 1, so it now points to the second last element in the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
