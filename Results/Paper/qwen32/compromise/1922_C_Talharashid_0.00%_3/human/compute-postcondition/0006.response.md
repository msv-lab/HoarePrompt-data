The code snippet provided initializes the variable `start` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `start` is 0.**
