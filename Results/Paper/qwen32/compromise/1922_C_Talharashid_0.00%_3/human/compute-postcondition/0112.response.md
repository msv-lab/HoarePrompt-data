The code snippet `s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` updates the value of `s2` based on the difference between the values of `d1` at keys `start` and `end`.

Given the initial state, `s2` is calculated as the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1` and is now `i + 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from `len(lst) - 1` to `0` with corresponding values of `s` after each iteration, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the first input integer minus 1, `end` is the second input integer minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

In simple terms, the value of `s2` is now the absolute difference between the values stored in `d1` at the indices `start` and `end`. All other variables retain their previous values.
