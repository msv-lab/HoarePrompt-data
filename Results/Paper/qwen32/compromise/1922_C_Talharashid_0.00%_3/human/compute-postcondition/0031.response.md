The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state of `s` is the original value of `s` plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[start]` is `s+1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1. If `start - 1 > -1`, `s+1` is updated to `s+1 + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `s+1` remains unchanged, and `mini` is updated to `min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)`. If `start - 1 <= -1`, `s+1` is updated to `s+1 + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `s+1` remains unchanged, and `mini` remains unchanged.**
