The code snippet updates the value of `mini` by taking the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. Given that `start` is initially `len(lst) - 1` and `start - 1` is guaranteed to be a valid index, the new value of `mini` will be the smaller of its previous value and the absolute difference between the last two elements of the list `lst`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is `len(lst) - 1` (which is at least 1), `end` is `0`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `11111111` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`.**
