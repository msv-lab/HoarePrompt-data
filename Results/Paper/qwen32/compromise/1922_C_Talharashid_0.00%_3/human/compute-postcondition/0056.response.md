Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is `len(lst) - 1` (which is at least 1), `end` is `0`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, and `mini` is the minimum of `11111111` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`. Otherwise, `mini` remains `11111111`.**
