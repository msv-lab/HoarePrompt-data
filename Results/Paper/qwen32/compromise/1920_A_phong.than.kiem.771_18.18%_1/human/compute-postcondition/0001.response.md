The code snippet assigns the value of `string.find(substring)` to the variable `index`. The `find` method returns the lowest index in the string where the substring is found. If the substring is not found, it returns `-1`. The variables `string` and `substring` remain unchanged, and `indices` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`string` is a string value, `substring` is a string value, `indices` is an empty list, `index` is the lowest index where `substring` is found in `string` or `-1` if `substring` is not found in `string`.**
