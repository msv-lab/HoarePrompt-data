You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the cost of bribing people to move Kirill to the desired position.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Cost Accumulation Logic:**
   - The program accumulates the cost in a way that doesn't correctly reflect the problem requirements. Specifically, when Kirill bribes a person at position `j` to move to position `i`, he needs to pay `a_j` coins to that person and `b_k` coins to all people `k` such that `j < k < i`. The current implementation does not correctly handle the accumulation of `b_k` costs.

2. **Incorrect Best Cost Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to keep track of the best cost using the `best` variable. However, the way it updates `best` does not consider all possible scenarios correctly. For example, if Kirill can reach a position with a lower cost by a different series of bribes, this is not properly captured.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - The program might not handle edge cases where the optimal solution involves a series of bribes that are not straightforward. For instance, if Kirill needs to bribe multiple people in a specific order to achieve the minimum cost, the current implementation might not account for this.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:

```
1
5 2
10 20 30 40 50
1 1 1 1 1
```

- **Expected Output:** 21 (Kirill bribes the second person to move to the front, paying 20 coins, and then bribes the first person to move to the second position, paying 1 coin).
- **Actual Output:** The program might not correctly calculate this and could output a different value.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a priority queue or dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position in the queue. The program should correctly accumulate the costs of bribing people and passing through them to find the minimum cost to reach one of the first `m` positions.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
