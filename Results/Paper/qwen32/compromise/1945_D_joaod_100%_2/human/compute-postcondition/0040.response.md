Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9, the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`. `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its previous value. If `best` is greater than the new `total`, `best` is updated to `total`.**

In simpler terms: The `total` has been increased by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
