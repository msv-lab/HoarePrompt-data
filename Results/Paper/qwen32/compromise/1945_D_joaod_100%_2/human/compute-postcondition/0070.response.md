The code snippet increments `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Given the initial state, `total` was 0, and it will now be equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is -1, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, the cost to pass at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) is less than or equal to the cost to change at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`).**
