Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9, the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input, `total` is 0, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `best` remains unchanged.**
