To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which is `for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):`. The key variables here are `v` and `na_frente`.

The loop will execute if `na_frente` is at least 0. The `range` function will generate values starting from `na_frente` down to 0 (inclusive) in steps of -1. 

Given the current state where `v` is -1 and `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1, we need to ensure that `na_frente` is at least 0 for the loop to execute. The state of `v` is not relevant before the loop starts, as `v` will be initialized by the `range` function in the first iteration of the loop.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`v` is -1, `total` is 0, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input**
