Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `v` is -1, `total` is 0, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `v` is -1, `total` is either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, updated if the new `total` is smaller when `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `best` remains `sys.float_info.max`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is updated based on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is smaller than the current `best`; otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `best` remains `sys.float_info.max`. `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is smaller than the current `best`; otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. `c` is incremented by 1. `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
