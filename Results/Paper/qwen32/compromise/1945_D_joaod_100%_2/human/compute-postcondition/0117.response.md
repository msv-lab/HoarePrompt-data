The code snippet `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` adds the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. Given the initial state, `total` was 0, and after the operation, `total` will be equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is -1, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is a very large positive float (`sys.float_info.max`), `c` is 9, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers provided by the input, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`**.
