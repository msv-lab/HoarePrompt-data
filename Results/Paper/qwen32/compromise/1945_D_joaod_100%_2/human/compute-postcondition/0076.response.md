The code snippet `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increases the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless `total` is used in subsequent conditions or calculations, which are not provided in this snippet.

Given the initial state, the value of `total` was either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, depending on a comparison. After the execution of the code snippet, `total` becomes `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, which means it will be `2 * custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it was initially `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, or `custo_pra_passar_b[v] + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it was initially `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

Output State: **`v` is `na_frente`, `total` is either `2 * custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v] + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` depending on the initial value of `total`, `best` is unchanged, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `best` remains `sys.float_info.max`.**
