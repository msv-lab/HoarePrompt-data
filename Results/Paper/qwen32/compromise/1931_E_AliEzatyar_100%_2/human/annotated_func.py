#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of test cases, where each test case is represented as a list containing two integers n and m, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `num` is `[[3, 5, [1, 2, 3]]]` and `counter` is 0.
    return counter
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers. The function returns 0 regardless of the input values.
