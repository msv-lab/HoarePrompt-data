The function `func_1` calculates and prints the minimum value between the initial value of `pergunta` and the sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` up to a certain point, considering the constraints provided by `n` and `m`. Specifically, it updates `pergunta` by comparing it with the sum of these minimum values for indices less than `m`.
