The code snippet assigns the variable `n` the length of the string `s`. Given that `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, the value of `n` will be the specific length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`.**
