You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that s is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the balance before processing the character, the index of the character, and the character itself; `balance` is 0.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string formed by concatenating the third elements of the tuples in `prefix_balance`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the described balanced shuffle operation.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a single line of input, which is a balanced parentheses sequence `s`.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - It initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store tuples of the form `(balance, position, character)`.
   - It initializes `balance` to 0 to keep track of the balance of the parentheses sequence as it iterates through the string.
   - For each character in the string `s` at position `i`, it appends a tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` to `prefix_balance`.
   - It updates the `balance` according to whether the character is an opening or closing parenthesis.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The `prefix_balance` list is sorted using a custom key in the `sort` method. The key is a lambda function that sorts primarily by `balance` in ascending order and secondarily by `position` in descending order (achieved by `-x[1]`).

4. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list.
   - It uses a list comprehension `[x[2] for x in prefix_balance]` to extract the characters from the sorted tuples and `''.join(...)` to concatenate them into a single string.

5. **Output**:
   - The resulting string is printed as the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

### Verification with the Example

Let's verify the program with the given example:

- **Input**: `(()(()))`
- **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
  - `(0, 0, '(')`
  - `(1, 1, '(')`
  - `(2, 2, ')')`
  - `(1, 3, '(')`
  - `(2, 4, '(')`
  - `(3, 5, ')')`
  - `(2, 6, ')')`
  - `(1, 7, ')')`
- **Sorting**:
  - Sorted by `balance` and `position` in descending order (when balances are equal):
    - `(0, 0, '(')`
    - `(1, 7, ')')`
    - `(1, 3, '(')`
    - `(1, 1, '(')`
    - `(2, 6, ')')`
    - `(2, 2, ')')`
    - `(2, 4, '(')`
    - `(3, 5, ')')`
- **Result**:
  - The characters in the sorted list are `'(', ')', '(', '(', ')', ')', '(', ')'`, which form the string `"()(()())"`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
