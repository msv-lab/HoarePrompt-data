#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that s is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the balance before processing the character, the index of the character, and the character itself; `balance` is 0.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string formed by concatenating the third elements of the tuples in `prefix_balance`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string formed by rearranging the characters based on their balance values and indices.
