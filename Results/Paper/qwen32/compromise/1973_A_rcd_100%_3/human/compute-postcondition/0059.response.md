Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` must be at least 1. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` is decreased by 1. `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`. `x` is increased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `x` has been incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable constraints remain unchanged.
