The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. This operation does not change the existing conditions on `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` except for the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` themselves, which are now set to the input values. The conditions on `t`, the sorted order of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd remain valid.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
