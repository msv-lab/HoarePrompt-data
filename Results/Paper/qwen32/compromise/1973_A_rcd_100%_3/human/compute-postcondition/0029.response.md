The code snippet `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Given the initial state, `x` could either be 0 or 1 based on the condition `if p1 - x <= p2 - y`. Since `x` is incremented by 1, if it was initially 0, it becomes 1; if it was initially 1, it becomes 2. However, the condition given implies that `x` should only be 0 or 1, so the only valid scenario here is that `x` was initially 0 and is now 1.

The values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only change is the value of `x`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `x` is 1 and `y` remains `p3`.**
