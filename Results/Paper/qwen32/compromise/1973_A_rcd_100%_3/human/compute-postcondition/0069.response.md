To determine the output of the print statement `print(p1 + p2)`, let's analyze the given initial state and the logic of the code.

### Given Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not directly used in the print statement).
2. `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
4. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
5. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program executes the if part.
6. Otherwise, the loop will print either `p1 - x + p3` where `p1 - x <= p2 - y` or `p3` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print(p1 + p2)` directly prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- The values of `p1` and `p2` are not explicitly given, but we know they are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, which means at least one of these integers is odd (since the sum of three even numbers is even).
- The order of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` indicates that `p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3`, but this does not affect the calculation of `p1 + p2` directly.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement `print(p1 + p2)` will be the sum of the integers `p1` and `p2` as read from the input.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers read from the input)**
