Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is non-negative, `x` is either 1 or 2, `y` is at least `x`**

In this output state, `x` has been incremented by 1, so if it was initially 0, it is now 1, and if it was initially 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
