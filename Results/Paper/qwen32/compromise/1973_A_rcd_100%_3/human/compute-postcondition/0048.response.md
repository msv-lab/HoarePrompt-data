The value of `y` is decremented by 1. Initially, `y` is `p3`. After the execution of `y -= 1`, `y` becomes `p3 - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `x` is 1; `y` is `p3 - 1`. Additionally, `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.**
