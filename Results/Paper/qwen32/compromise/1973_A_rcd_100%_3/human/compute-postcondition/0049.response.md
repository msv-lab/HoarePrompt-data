Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then `x` is 0 and `y` is `p3`. Otherwise, `x` is 1 and `y` is `p3 - 1`.**
