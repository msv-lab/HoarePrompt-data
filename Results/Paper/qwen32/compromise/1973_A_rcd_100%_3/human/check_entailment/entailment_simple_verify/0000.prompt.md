You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and verify that it handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is between 1 and 500.
   - Each test case consists of three integers \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \) where \( 0 \leq p_1, p_2, p_3 \leq 30 \).

2. **Logic for Maximum Draws:**
   - **Sum of Scores Check:** The program first checks if the total sum of scores \((p_1 + p_2 + p_3)\) is even. If not, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible since each game results in an even total score (either 0+2, 2+0, or 1+1).
   - **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
     - If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the maximum number of draws is \( p_1 + p_2 \). This is because the third player's score could be entirely from wins against the other two players, and the remaining points could be from draws among the three.
     - Otherwise, the program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It iterates over possible values of \( x \) (points from wins by the first player) and \( y \) (points from wins by the second player) such that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \). The maximum number of draws is then calculated as \( p1 - x + p3 \).

### Verification Against Test Cases

Let's verify the program against the provided example input:

1. **Test Case: 0 0 0**
   - Total score is 0, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), it enters the loop but finds that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) is satisfied with \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).
   - The maximum number of draws is \( p1 - 0 + p3 = 0 \).

2. **Test Case: 0 1 1**
   - Total score is 2, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), it enters the loop and finds that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) is satisfied with \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 1 \).
   - The maximum number of draws is \( p1 - 0 + p3 = 1 \).

3. **Test Case: 1 1 1**
   - Total score is 3, which is odd.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

4. **Test Case: 1 1 2**
   - Total score is 4, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), it enters the loop and finds that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) is satisfied with \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).
   - The maximum number of draws is \( p1 - 0 + p3 = 2 \).

5. **Test Case: 3 3 3**
   - Total score is 9, which is odd.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

6. **Test Case: 3 4 5**
   - Total score is 12, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the maximum number of draws is \( p_1 + p_2 = 7 \).

7. **Test Case: 1 1 10**
   - Total score is 12, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), it enters the loop and finds that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) is satisfied with \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).
   - The maximum number of draws is \( p1 - 0 + p3 = 2 \).

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly handles the given test cases and the logic seems robust for all potential cases within the given constraints. It correctly checks for impossible score configurations and calculates the maximum number of draws in valid scenarios.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all edge cases, including impossible score configurations and scenarios where the maximum number of draws needs to be calculated. It passes all the provided test cases and seems to be logically sound for all possible inputs within the constraints.
