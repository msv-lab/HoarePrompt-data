Reasoning:  
The program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players in chess games, or to determine if the given scores are not possible.

The program first checks if the total sum of the scores is even. This is because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1). If the sum of the scores is odd, it immediately returns `-1` as it's impossible to achieve an odd total score with the given rules.

If the sum is even, the program further checks if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`). If this condition is met, the maximum number of draws that could have occurred is `p1 + p2`. This is because the third player could have drawn with each of the other two players, and the remaining games could have been won by the third player.

If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program enters a loop where it tries to find the maximum number of draws. It iterates through possible values of `x` (losses for player 1) and `y` (losses for player 2), decrementing `y` and incrementing `x` in each iteration. The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` ensures that the remaining scores for players 1 and 2 are consistent with the rules of the game. If such a condition is met, the program prints the maximum number of draws, which is `p1 - x + p3`.

The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement and the execution summary. It correctly identifies impossible score combinations and calculates the maximum number of draws for valid combinations.

Correctness: **True**
