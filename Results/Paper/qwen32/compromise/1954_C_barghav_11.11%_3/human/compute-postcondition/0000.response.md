The code snippet provided reads an input string and converts it into a list of characters. Given the initial state, the variable `a` will be assigned the list of characters from the input string. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string.**
