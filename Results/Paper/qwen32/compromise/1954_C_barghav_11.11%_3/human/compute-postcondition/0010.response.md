Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it receives two integers `x` and `y`. Each integer consists only of digits from 1 to 9, and both are within the range 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100. The function returns the result for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.**
