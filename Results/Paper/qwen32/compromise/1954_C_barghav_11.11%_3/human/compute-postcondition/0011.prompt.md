You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
        
    #State: `t` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop. `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not used in the loop. The list `a` will have its first half sorted in descending order and its second half sorted in ascending order. The list `b` will have its first half sorted in ascending order and its second half sorted in descending order.
    #
    #Output State:
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: t remains the same as it is not modified by the loop. x and y remain unchanged as they are not used in the loop. The list a will have its first half sorted in descending order and its second half sorted in ascending order. The list b will have its first half sorted in ascending order and its second half sorted in descending order. The print statement will output all elements of list a concatenated together without any spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: a (where a is a list with its first half sorted in descending order and its second half sorted in ascending order, concatenated into a single string)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: the elements of list b concatenated together without spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it receives two integers `x` and `y`. Each integer consists only of digits from 1 to 9, and both are within the range 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100. The function returns the result for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
