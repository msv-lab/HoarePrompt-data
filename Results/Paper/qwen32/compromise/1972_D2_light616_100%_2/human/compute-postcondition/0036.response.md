Output State: **`x` is increased by 1, `y` is the value that caused the loop to terminate, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `cnt` is incremented based on the GCD condition for each valid pair `(x, y)`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`y`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt`) retain their initial values or conditions as described in the initial state.
