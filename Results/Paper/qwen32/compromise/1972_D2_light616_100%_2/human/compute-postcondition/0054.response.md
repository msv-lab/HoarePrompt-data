To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the variables. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` and `m` are read from the input.
   - `x` is initialized to 1.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0.

2. **Outer Loop (`while x * x <= n`)**:
   - The loop continues as long as `x * x` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Inner Loop (`while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`)**:
   - For each `x`, `y` starts at 1 and increments until either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`.
   - If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

4. **Termination**:
   - The outer loop terminates when `x * x` exceeds `n`.

Let's consider the final state:
- `x` will be incremented until `x * x` exceeds `n`. Therefore, the final value of `x` will be the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`.
- `y` will be the last value it took in the inner loop before the inner loop terminated.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- `cnt` will hold the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are satisfied.

### Final Output State:
- `x` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
- `y` will be the last value it took in the inner loop before the inner loop terminated.
- `cnt` will be the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` satisfying the conditions mentioned above.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, `y` is the last value it took in the inner loop before termination, `cnt` is the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` satisfying the conditions, and `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**
