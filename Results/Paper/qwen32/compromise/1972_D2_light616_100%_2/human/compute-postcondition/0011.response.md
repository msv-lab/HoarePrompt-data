To determine the new value of `cnt`, we need to evaluate the expression `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` and add it to the current value of `cnt`.

Given:
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 2
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3
- `m` is greater than or equal to 6
- `cnt` is `min(n // 2, m // 2)` if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1

First, let's calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y`:
- `(x + y) * x = (1 + 2) * 1 = 3`
- `(x + y) * y = (1 + 2) * 2 = 6`

Next, we calculate `n // 3` and `m // 6`:
- Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `n // 3` is at least 1.
- Since `m` is greater than or equal to 6, `m // 6` is at least 1.

Now, we find `min(n // 3, m // 6)`:
- This value depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but it will be the smaller of `n // 3` and `m // 6`.

Let's denote `min(n // 3, m // 6)` as `k`. Thus, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + k`.

Since the gcd of `x` and `y` (which are 1 and 2 respectively) is 1, the initial value of `cnt` was `min(n // 2, m // 2)`.

Therefore, the new value of `cnt` is `min(n // 2, m // 2) + min(n // 3, m // 6)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is `min(n // 2, m // 2) + min(n // 3, m // 6)`**.
