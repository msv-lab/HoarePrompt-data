To determine the output of the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `x` is defined as the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`. This means if `n` is a perfect square, `x` will be the next integer after the square root of `n`.
- `y` is the last value it took in the inner loop before termination. The exact value of `y` depends on the logic inside the inner loop, but it is not crucial for determining the value of `cnt`.
- `cnt` is the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy certain conditions. The exact conditions are not specified in the initial state, but `cnt` represents how many such pairs were found.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged, so they do not affect the value of `cnt` directly.

Given this information, the `print(cnt)` statement will output the value of `cnt`, which is the count of valid pairs `(x, y)` that met the specified conditions during the execution of the loops.

Since the exact conditions and the loops themselves are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we know that `cnt` is an integer representing the number of valid pairs found.

Therefore, the output of the `print(cnt)` statement will be:

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the total count of valid pairs (x, y) satisfying the conditions)**
