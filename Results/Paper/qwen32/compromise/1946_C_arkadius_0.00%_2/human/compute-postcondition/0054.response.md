Output State: **`v` is a valid vertex in `tree`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `stack` has one less element and is not empty if it had more than one element before popping, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**

In natural language: The value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. All other conditions and states remain the same as described in the initial state.
