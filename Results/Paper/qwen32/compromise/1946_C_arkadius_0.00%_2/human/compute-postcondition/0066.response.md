The code appends a tuple `(v, True)` to the `stack`. This means that the `stack` will now have one more element than it did before the operation. The values of `v` and `postorder` remain unchanged as they were only used to pop from the `stack` and not modified in this snippet.

Output State: **`v` and `postorder` are the values of the last element popped from `stack`; `stack` has one more element than before, which is `(v, True)`.**
