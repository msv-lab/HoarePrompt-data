The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but it must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `k` is the second integer input, and `1 <= k < n`; `tree` is an instance of `Tree` initialized with `n` nodes and includes an edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`; `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input; `i` is 3. The `tree` now includes an additional edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`.**
