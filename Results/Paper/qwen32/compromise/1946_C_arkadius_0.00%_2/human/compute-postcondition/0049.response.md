Postcondition: **`v` is a valid vertex in `tree`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `stack` has one less element and is not empty if it had more than one element before popping, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`**
