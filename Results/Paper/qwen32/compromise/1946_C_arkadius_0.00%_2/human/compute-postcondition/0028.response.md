Output State: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children and attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `postorder` is `True`. `stack` remains unchanged. `v` remains unchanged. `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children`. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its previous value, `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and 1.**

In natural language: The `good_components` attribute of the vertex `v` in the `tree` object has been incremented by 1, in addition to its previous value and the `good_components` of its child `u`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
