Postcondition: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children and attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`. If `postorder` is `True`, the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` has been increased by the `good_components` of each child `u` of `v`. Additionally, for each child `u` of `v`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further increased by 1. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. The variable `postorder` remains `True`. The variable `stack` remains unchanged. The variable `v` remains unchanged. If `postorder` is `False`, there are no changes to `tree`, `stack`, `v`, or `postorder`.**
