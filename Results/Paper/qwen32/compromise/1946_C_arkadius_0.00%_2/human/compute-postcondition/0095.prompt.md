Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children and attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `stack` is `[(s, False)]`.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    if postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u
                ].good_components
            if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
            else:
                tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u
                    ].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children and attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`. If `postorder` is `True`, the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` has been increased by the `good_components` of each child `u` of `v`. Additionally, for each child `u` of `v`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further increased by 1. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. The variable `postorder` remains `True`. The variable `stack` remains unchanged. The variable `v` remains unchanged. If `postorder` is `False`, there are no changes to `tree`, `stack`, `v`, or `postorder`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `v` is a valid vertex in `tree`. If `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v`, plus the number of children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. `stack` has one less element if it had more than one element before popping. If `postorder` is `False`, the state of `tree` and `stack` remains as per the precondition.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `v` is a vertex, and `postorder` is either empty or not empty. If `postorder` is not empty, `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully processed, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` includes the good components of all children of `v` and any additional good components where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` includes the remaining sizes of all children `u` where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size < x`. If `postorder` is empty, no specific changes are made to `tree.vertices[v]` related to its children, good components, or remaining size.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
