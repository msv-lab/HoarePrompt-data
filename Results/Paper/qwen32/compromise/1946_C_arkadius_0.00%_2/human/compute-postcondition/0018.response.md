Postcondition: **`tree` is an object representing a tree with `n` vertices, where `n` is greater than 1; `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; `mid` is `(((n + 2) // 2 + n + 1) // 2 + n + 1) // 2`; `beg` is `((n + 2) // 2 + n + 1) // 2`; and `end` is `n` if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true. Otherwise, `end` is `mid - 1`.**
