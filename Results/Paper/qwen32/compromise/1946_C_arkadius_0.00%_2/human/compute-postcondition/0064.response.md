The only variable in the loop head is `stack`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `stack` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` has one less element if it had more than one element before popping. For the loop to execute one more time, `stack` must not be empty.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `stack` has at least one element. If `stack` had more than one element before popping, it currently has at least one element. If `stack` had exactly one element before popping, it is now empty, and we need to add an element back to it.

State: **`v` is a valid vertex in `tree`. If `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v`, plus the number of children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. `stack` must have at least one element. If `postorder` is `False`, the state of `tree` and `stack` remains as per the precondition.**
