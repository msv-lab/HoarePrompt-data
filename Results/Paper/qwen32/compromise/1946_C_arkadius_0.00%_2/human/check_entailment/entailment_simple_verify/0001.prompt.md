You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze each function and how they work together to solve the problem. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a tree with `n` vertices.
   - We need to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible value of `x`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum `x`.
   - It involves defining a tree structure and several functions to traverse and evaluate the tree.

3. **Tree Structure**:
   - The `Tree` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code and is used to represent the tree structure.
   - The tree is rooted at vertex 0 (0-indexed) and the edges are added with vertices adjusted to be 0-indexed.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is assumed to root the tree at the specified vertex, setting up the tree for traversal.

4. **Functions**:
   - **`func_1` and `func_2`**: These functions perform a postorder traversal of the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
     - `func_1` uses a stack to perform an iterative postorder traversal.
     - `func_2` is a recursive version of the same logic.
   - **`func_3`**: This function checks if it is possible to have `k` good components with each having at least `x` vertices.
     - It uses `func_1` to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - It returns `True` if the conditions are met, otherwise `False`.
   - **`func_4`**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
     - It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to `n`.
     - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is feasible.
     - It adjusts `beg` and `end` based on the result of `func_3`.
   - **`func_5`**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and prints the result of `func_4`.

5. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The binary search in `func_4` is correct for finding the maximum `x` because it efficiently narrows down the feasible range.
   - The traversal and calculations in `func_1` and `func_3` are correct for determining the number of good components and the remaining size.
   - The logic in `func_3` correctly checks if the conditions are met for a given `x`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 1 and `n` is 2 correctly, as demonstrated in the example.
   - It also handles cases where `k` is close to `n` and where `k` is small.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
