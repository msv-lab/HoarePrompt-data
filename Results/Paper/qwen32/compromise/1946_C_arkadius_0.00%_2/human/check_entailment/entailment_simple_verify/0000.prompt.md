You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description. Let's go through the potential problems:

1. **Tree Data Structure**:
   - The `Tree` class is referenced in the code but is not defined. This class should handle the tree structure, including adding edges and rooting the tree. Without this class definition, it's impossible to verify if the tree operations are correctly implemented.

2. **Rooting the Tree**:
   - The function `root_tree_non_recursive` is called on the `Tree` object but is not defined in the provided code. This function is crucial to ensure that the tree is rooted at a specific node, which is necessary for the subsequent operations.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when the tree is a star graph (one central node with all other nodes connected to it), a path graph, or a tree with multiple branches. These cases need to be tested to ensure the correctness of the solution.

4. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search in `func_4` is intended to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. The implementation seems correct, but it depends on the correct implementation of `func_3` and the tree operations.

5. **Component Size Calculation**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are supposed to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each component. These functions should correctly handle the post-order traversal and aggregation of component sizes. However, without the `Tree` class definition, it's impossible to verify if these functions work as intended.

6. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_5` reads input and processes each test case. It assumes that the input is correctly formatted and that the `Tree` class handles the tree operations correctly. If the `Tree` class is not correctly implemented, `func_5` will not work as expected.

To verify the correctness of the program, the `Tree` class and its methods (`add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`) need to be defined and thoroughly tested with various edge cases. Since the `Tree` class is missing, the program cannot be considered correct.

Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
