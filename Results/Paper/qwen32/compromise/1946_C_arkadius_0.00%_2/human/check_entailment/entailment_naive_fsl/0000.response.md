Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description. Let's go through the potential problems:

1. **Tree Data Structure**:
   - The `Tree` class is referenced in the code but is not defined. This class should handle the tree structure, including adding edges and rooting the tree. Without this class definition, it's impossible to verify if the tree operations are correctly implemented.

2. **Rooting the Tree**:
   - The function `root_tree_non_recursive` is called on the `Tree` object but is not defined in the provided code. This function is crucial to ensure that the tree is rooted at a specific node, which is necessary for the subsequent operations.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when the tree is a star graph (one central node with all other nodes connected to it), a path graph, or a tree with multiple branches. These cases need to be tested to ensure the correctness of the solution.

4. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search in `func_4` is intended to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. The implementation seems correct, but it depends on the correct implementation of `func_3` and the tree operations.

5. **Component Size Calculation**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are supposed to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each component. These functions should correctly handle the post-order traversal and aggregation of component sizes. However, without the `Tree` class definition, it's impossible to verify if these functions work as intended.

6. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_5` reads input and processes each test case. It assumes that the input is correctly formatted and that the `Tree` class handles the tree operations correctly. If the `Tree` class is not correctly implemented, `func_5` will not work as expected.

To verify the correctness of the program, the `Tree` class and its methods (`add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`) need to be defined and thoroughly tested with various edge cases. Since the `Tree` class is missing, the program cannot be considered correct.

Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
