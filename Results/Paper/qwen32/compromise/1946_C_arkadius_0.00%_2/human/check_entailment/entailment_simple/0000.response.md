### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Tree Representation and Construction**:
   - The `Tree` class is used to represent the tree structure. Each vertex has a list of edges and children, as well as attributes to store the subtree size, parent, number of good components, and remaining size.
   - The tree is constructed by reading the edges from the input and adding them to the tree structure.
   - The tree is then rooted at vertex 0 using a non-recursive approach.

2. **Functions `func_1` and `func_2`**:
   - Both `func_1` and `func_2` perform a post-order traversal of the tree to compute the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
   - A good component is defined as a subtree whose size is at least `x`.
   - The `remaining_size` for a subtree is the sum of the sizes of all subtrees where the size is less than `x`.
   - Both functions return the number of good components and the remaining size for the subtree rooted at the given vertex.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to determine the number of good components and the remaining size.
   - It returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components is equal to `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is feasible.
   - It returns the maximum feasible `x`.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function reads the input for each test case, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x`.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly constructs the tree and roots it.
- The traversal functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly compute the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
- The feasibility check function (`func_3`) correctly determines if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
- The binary search function (`func_4`) correctly finds the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.
- The main function (`func_5`) correctly processes each test case and prints the result.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
