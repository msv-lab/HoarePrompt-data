t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 200. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and the list of subarray sums contains \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) integers, each between 1 and \(10^9\). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000. There is always at least one valid solution for each test case.
