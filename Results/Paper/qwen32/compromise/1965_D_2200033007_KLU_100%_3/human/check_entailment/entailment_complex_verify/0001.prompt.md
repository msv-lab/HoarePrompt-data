You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the logic step by step and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Palindrome Array**: The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning `a[i] = a[n - i - 1]`.
2. **Subarray Sums**: We are given all but one of the subarray sums of `a`.
3. **Objective**: Recover the palindrome array `a`.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of four functions:
1. **func_1(a)**: Generates all subarray sums of `a` and sorts them.
2. **func_2(cts)**: Processes the sorted subarray sums to identify the unique sums that appear an odd number of times. This is based on the observation that if a subarray sum appears an even number of times, it means there are two identical subarrays contributing to that sum, which should cancel out when we consider the differences.
3. **func_3(odds, n)**: Constructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique sums identified by `func_2`. It uses the fact that the difference between consecutive sums in `odds` corresponds to the elements of the array `a`.
4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**: This function seems to find the missing subarray sum by comparing the complete list of subarray sums (`bigList`) with the list of provided sums (`smallList`). However, it is not used in the main logic flow of the program.

### Main Logic Flow:
- Generate all possible subarray sums of a hypothetical palindrome array `a` using `func_1`.
- Identify the unique sums that appear an odd number of times using `func_2`.
- Construct the palindrome array `a` from these unique sums using `func_3`.

### Verification:
Let's verify if this approach works correctly:
- **Generating Subarray Sums**: `func_1` correctly generates all subarray sums and sorts them.
- **Identifying Unique Sums**: `func_2` correctly identifies the sums that appear an odd number of times. This is crucial because the missing subarray sum will appear an odd number of times when compared to the provided sums.
- **Constructing the Array**: `func_3` constructs the array `a` by leveraging the differences between consecutive sums in `odds`. Since `a` is a palindrome, the differences between consecutive sums in `odds` should correspond to the elements of `a`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program correctly generates subarray sums, identifies the unique sums that appear an odd number of times, and constructs the palindrome array `a` from these sums, the program appears to be correct.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
