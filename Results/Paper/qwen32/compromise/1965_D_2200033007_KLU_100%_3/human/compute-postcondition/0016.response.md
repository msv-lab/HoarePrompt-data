Postcondition: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least two integers; `x` is the second element in the `odds` list. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is equal to `odds[1]`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both equal to `(x - prev) // 2`.**
