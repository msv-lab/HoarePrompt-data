The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `odds` list. If there are more elements in the `odds` list, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the second element in the `odds` list (`odds[1]`). For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should now be the next element in the `odds` list, which would be `odds[2]`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least three integers; `x` is the third element in the `odds` list. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is equal to `odds[1]`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both equal to `(x - prev) // 2`. `prev` is now equal to `x`. `idx` is decreased by 1.**
