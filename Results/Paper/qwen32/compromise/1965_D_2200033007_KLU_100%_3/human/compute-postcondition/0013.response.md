The code assigns the value of `x` to the element of the list `a` at the index `idx`. Since `x` is specified as the second element in the `odds` list, the value of `a[idx]` will now be equal to `odds[1]`.

Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least two integers; `x` is the second element in the `odds` list; `a[idx]` is equal to `odds[1]`.**
