The code snippet `sm = sm + a[j]` adds the value of `a[j]` to `sm`. Given that `sm` was initially `2 * a[3]` and `j` is `4`, `sm` will now be `2 * a[3] + a[4]`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.

Output State: **`a` remains the same, `cts` will be `[a[0], a[0] + a[1], a[0] + a[1] + a[2], ..., sum(a), a[1], a[1] + a[2], ..., sum(a) - a[0], a[3], 2 * a[3]]`, `sm` is `2 * a[3] + a[4]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `len(a)` must be greater than 4**.
