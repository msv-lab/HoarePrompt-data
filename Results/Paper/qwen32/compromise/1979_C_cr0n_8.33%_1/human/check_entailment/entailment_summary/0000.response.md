### Reasoning:
Let's break down the provided program and analyze if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.

2. **Calculating Product:**
   - It calculates the product of all the multipliers in `vals` and stores it in `prod`.

3. **Generating `vprod`:**
   - It computes a list `vprod` where each element is the product `prod` divided by the corresponding multiplier in `vals`. This is essentially the product of all multipliers except the current one.

4. **Calculating `den`:**
   - It calculates `den` as the product `prod` minus the sum of `vprod`. This represents the total bet that needs to be less than the winnings for any winning outcome.

5. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` indicating that it's not possible to distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as the bets for each outcome.

6. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach is based on the idea that if we bet `prod // k_i` on the i-th outcome, the total bet will be the sum of all `prod // k_i` values, which is `prod - sum(vprod)`. For the bets to be valid, this sum must be strictly less than `prod // k_i * k_i` for any `i`, which simplifies to `prod - sum(vprod) < prod // k_i * k_i`. Since `prod // k_i * k_i` is exactly `prod` minus the terms in `vprod` except `prod // k_i`, this condition holds true.
   - The constraints on `prod` and `vprod` ensure that the values are within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets based on the given multipliers and checks if a valid distribution is possible. If a valid distribution is found, it outputs the bets; otherwise, it outputs `-1`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
