Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the logic for calculating the bets (`vprod`) and the check for the denominator (`den`) can lead to incorrect results or invalid outputs.

Let's analyze the program:

1. **Product Calculation**:
   ```python
   prod = 1
   for r in vals:
       prod *= r
   ```
   This calculates the product of all multipliers. This part is correct.

2. **Bets Calculation**:
   ```python
   vprod = [prod // r for r in vals]
   ```
   This calculates the bets by dividing the product by each multiplier. This part is also correct in terms of logic, but it does not ensure that the total bets are strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.

3. **Denominator Check**:
   ```python
   den = prod - sum(vprod)
   if den <= 0:
       print(-1)
       return
   ```
   This checks if the total bets are strictly less than the winnings for each outcome. However, the logic here is flawed. The denominator (`den`) is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`, which should ideally be a positive value indicating the excess amount that ensures the winnings are greater than the total bets. However, this check does not guarantee that the individual bets are distributed correctly to satisfy the condition for all outcomes.

4. **Output**:
   ```python
   print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
   ```
   This prints the calculated bets. However, as mentioned, the bets calculation does not ensure the required condition for all outcomes.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a simple counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1 1
```

**Program Output:**
```
2 2 2
```

In this case, the program calculates the bets as `[2, 2, 2]`, which totals `6`. The winnings for each outcome would be `4`, which is not greater than `6`. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the condition for this input.

Hence, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
