To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does with each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, then checks if `4 * n - 2` equals `k`. If they are equal, it prints `k // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

The initial state given is that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. After the loop has processed all `t` test cases, the variable `t` will remain unchanged since it is only used to control the loop iterations and is not modified within the loop.

The variables `n` and `k` are local to each iteration of the loop and do not retain their values between iterations. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `n` and `k` will not have any specific values as they are overwritten in each iteration.

The output of the program will be a series of printed values, one for each test case, but these printed values are not stored in any variable within the scope of the loop. Therefore, they do not affect the state of any variable in the program after the loop completes.

Output State: **t remains unchanged, n and k are not retained after the loop.**
