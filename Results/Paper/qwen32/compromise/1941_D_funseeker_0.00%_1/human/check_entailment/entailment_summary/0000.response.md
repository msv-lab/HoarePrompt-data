### Reasoning:

Let's analyze whether the given functions together meet the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads a line of input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to read input values.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads an integer from the input. It calls `func_1` to get the next line of input and converts it to an integer. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to read the number of test cases, `t`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer. It is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to read these values.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function is the core of the solution. It processes each test case as follows:
     - It reads the values `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`.
     - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
     - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` using `func_1`.
     - It updates the set `ans` to include the new possible positions of the ball after each throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if the direction is unknown (`?`).
     - It ensures that the position `0` is replaced with `n` if it appears in the set.
     - Finally, it prints the number of unique players who could have the ball and their positions in increasing order.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Input Handling**: Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly handle the input as per the problem description.
- **Processing Each Test Case**: Function `func_4` correctly processes each test case by updating the possible positions of the ball after each throw, considering all possible directions for unknown throws.
- **Output**: Function `func_4` correctly outputs the number of unique players and their positions in increasing order.

The logic in `func_4` correctly handles the circular nature of the problem and the uncertainty in the direction of some throws.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together meet the problem description and correctly solve the problem.

**Correctness: True**
