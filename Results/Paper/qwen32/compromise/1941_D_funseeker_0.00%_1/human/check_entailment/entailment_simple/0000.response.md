### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the possible positions of a ball after a series of throws in a circular arrangement of players. The program reads multiple test cases, each specifying the number of players, the number of throws, the starting player, and the details of each throw (distance and direction). 

The program uses a set `ans` to keep track of possible positions of the ball. Initially, `ans` contains the starting player `x`. For each throw, the program iterates through the set `ans` and calculates the new possible positions based on the throw distance `r` and direction `c`. If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise), the new position is `(q + r) % n`. If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise), the new position is `(q - r) % n`. If the direction `c` is '?', both directions are considered.

After processing all throws, if `0` is in the set `ans` (which represents the last player due to the modulo operation), it is replaced with `n` to correctly represent the player number. The program then prints the number of unique possible positions and the sorted list of these positions.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, such as:
- Multiple test cases.
- Throws in both directions.
- Unknown directions.
- The modulo operation to wrap around the circle of players.
- The conversion from `0` to `n` to represent the last player correctly.
