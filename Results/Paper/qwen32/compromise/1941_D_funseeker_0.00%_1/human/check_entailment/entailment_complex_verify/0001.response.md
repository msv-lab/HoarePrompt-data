To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotated version, we need to ensure that the program correctly processes each test case, handles all possible throw directions, and outputs the correct set of players who could have the ball after `m` throws.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Verification:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with `x`, representing the starting player.

2. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads `r` and `c` using `func_1().split()`.
   - It converts `r` to an integer.
   - It initializes a temporary set `temp` to store possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - For each player `q` in the current set `ans`:
     - If the throw is clockwise (`c == '0'`) or the direction is unknown (`c == '?'`), it calculates the new position as `(q + r) % n` and adds it to `temp`.
     - If the throw is counterclockwise (`c == '1'`) or the direction is unknown (`c == '?'`), it calculates the new position as `(q - r) % n` and adds it to `temp`.
   - It updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the position wraps around the circle using modulo `n` operations.
   - If `0` is in `ans`, it removes `0` and adds `n` to handle the case where the position wraps around to the start of the circle. This is necessary because Python's modulo operation returns `0` when the result is exactly `0`, which corresponds to player `n` in a 1-based index system.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the number of players who could have the ball, which is the size of `ans`.
   - It prints the sorted list of these players.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Initialization:** The initial position `x` is correctly added to `ans`.
- **Throw Processing:** The logic for updating positions based on the throw direction and distance is correct. It considers both clockwise and counterclockwise movements when the direction is unknown.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The program correctly handles the case where the position wraps around the circle using modulo `n` operations.
- **Output:** The output format matches the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the problem's logic and handles all specified cases. The annotated version confirms that the program processes each step as intended and handles edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
