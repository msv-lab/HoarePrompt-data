Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are greater than 0, `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r`, and `c`, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1().split()` and `r` is now an integer. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**
