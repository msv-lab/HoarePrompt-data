The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q - r) % n`. This means the set `temp` will now include this new computed value in addition to any values it previously contained.

Given the initial state, `temp` initially contains the element `(q + r) % n`. After executing the code, `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

The other variables (`n`, `m-2`, `x`, `r`, `c`, `ans`) remain unchanged in terms of their values and conditions.

Output State: **`n` and `m-2` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. `ans` is a set containing at least one element, where each element is a value `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`.**
