The code snippet provided is `ans = temp`, which means the variable `ans` is being assigned the value of the variable `temp`. 

Given the initial state, `temp` is a set containing all elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`. After the assignment, `ans` will now hold the same values as `temp`.

The other variables (`n`, `m-2`, `x`, `r`, `c`, and the original `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m-2` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is a set containing all elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`. `ans` is a set containing all elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`.**
