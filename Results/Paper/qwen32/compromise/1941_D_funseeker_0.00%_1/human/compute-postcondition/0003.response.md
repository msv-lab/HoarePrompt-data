The code snippet provided assigns the values returned by `func_1().split()` to the variables `r` and `c`. The initial state tells us that `n`, `m`, and `x` have specific values returned by `func_3()`, and `ans` is a set containing `x`. The code does not modify `n`, `m`, `x`, or `ans`.

Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 0, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1().split()`**.
