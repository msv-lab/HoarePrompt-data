The code snippet provided is:

```python
ans = temp
```

This line of code assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will now hold the same set of values that `temp` holds. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m-1` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`. `ans` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`.**
