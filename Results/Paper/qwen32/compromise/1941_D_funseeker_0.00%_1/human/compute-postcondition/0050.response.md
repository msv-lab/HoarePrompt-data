The code snippet `r = int(r)` converts the variable `r` to an integer. Given that `r` was already described as the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, this operation does not change the value of `r`. The other variables (`n`, `m-2`, `x`, `c`, `temp`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m-2` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`. `ans` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`.**
