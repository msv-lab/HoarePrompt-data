The code snippet adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given that `q` is `q_next`, the next value in `ans` that has not yet been taken, and `r` and `n` are integers greater than 0, the set `temp` will now include this new value.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r`, `c`, and at least one more element `q_next` that has not yet been taken; `r` is an integer; `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and possibly other values depending on the initial conditions of `c` and `q`. `q` is `q_next`, the next value in `ans` that has not yet been taken.**

In simpler terms: The set `temp` now includes the value `(q + r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
