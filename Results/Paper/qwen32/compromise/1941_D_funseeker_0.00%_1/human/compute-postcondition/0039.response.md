The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q - r) % n`. This operation does not affect the other variables, and the conditions on `n`, `m-1`, `x`, `r`, `c`, `ans`, and `q` remain the same. The only change is the addition of a new element to the set `temp`.

Output State: **`n` and `m-1` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the element `(q_next + r) % n` and the new element `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` contains the new element `(q - r) % n`; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `q` is `q_next`.**
