Output State: **`n` and `m-1` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`. `ans` is the original `ans` set updated to contain the elements from `temp`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variables `n`, `m-1`, and `x` remain unchanged. The variable `r` is still the integer part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second part of that string. The `temp` set contains all the computed values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` set, depending on the value of `c`. Finally, the `ans` set is updated to include all the elements from the `temp` set.
