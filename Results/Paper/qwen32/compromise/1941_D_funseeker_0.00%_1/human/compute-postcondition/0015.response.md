Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r`, and `c`; `r` is an integer; `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', and also contains `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'; `q` is the next value in `ans` that has not yet been taken.**
