To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(m):`, so the only variable we can adjust is `m`.

The loop will execute if and only if `m` is greater than 0. The values of `n`, `x`, and `ans` do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself, as they are not part of the loop head.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `m` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than 0.
3. The values of `n`, `x`, and `ans` do not influence whether the loop will execute; they can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `m` is greater than 0.

State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 0, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `ans` is a set containing `x`.**
