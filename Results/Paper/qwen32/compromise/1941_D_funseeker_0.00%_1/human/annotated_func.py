#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`. Therefore, there are no values or relationships to describe.
def func_1():

    #The program returns a string that is the next line of input from sys.stdin, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns a string that is the next line of input from `sys.stdin`, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not have any parameters. It relies on the function `func_1` to return a value that can be converted to an integer.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It calls the function `func_1`, converts the returned value to an integer, and returns this integer value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_3` does not take any parameters. It implicitly relies on the output of `func_1()`, which is expected to return a string that can be split into a list of integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes no parameters and returns a list of integers. This list is created by splitting a string returned by `func_1()` and converting each split string element into an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000), and x is an integer representing the starting player (1 <= x <= n).

If `0` is in `ans`, `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`. The loop has executed `m` times, and `ans` now contains all the values generated through the specified operations for each iteration.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the number of unique players and their positions who end up holding an item after `m` throws, starting from player `x` in a circular arrangement of `n` players. If player position `0` is calculated, it is replaced with `n`.
