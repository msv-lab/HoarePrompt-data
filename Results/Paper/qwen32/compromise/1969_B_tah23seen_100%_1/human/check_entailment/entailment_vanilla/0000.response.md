Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's) by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution defines a function `func_1(s)` that calculates the cost for a given binary string `s`.

Here's the logic of the function:
1. Initialize `cost` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost.
2. Initialize `one` to 0, which counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
3. Iterate through each character `i` in the string `s`:
   - If `i` is '1', increment the `one` counter.
   - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0 (indicating that there are '1's before this '0'), add `one + 1` to the `cost`. The `+1` accounts for the cost of shifting the substring that includes this '0' and all preceding '1's.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if this logic correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string.

- **Case 1:** If the string is already sorted (all '0's followed by all '1's), the function will return 0, which is correct because no operations are needed.
- **Case 2:** For a string like "11000", the function correctly calculates the cost as 9:
  - The first '0' encounters two '1's before it, so the cost is 2 + 1 = 3.
  - The second '0' encounters two '1's before it, so the cost is 2 + 1 = 3.
  - The third '0' encounters two '1's before it, so the cost is 2 + 1 = 3.
  - Total cost = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.
- **Case 3:** For a string like "10", the function correctly calculates the cost as 2:
  - The '0' encounters one '1' before it, so the cost is 1 + 1 = 2.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1(s)` correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost required to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
