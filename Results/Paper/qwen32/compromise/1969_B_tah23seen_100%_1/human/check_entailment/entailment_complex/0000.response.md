### Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum cost required to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any substring. The function `func_1` provided calculates this cost based on the number of consecutive '1's followed by a '0'. Let's break down the logic and correctness of the function.

The function `func_1` iterates through the string `s` and keeps track of the number of consecutive '1's encountered (`one`). Whenever a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's, the cost is incremented by the number of consecutive '1's plus one. This is because each '1' needs to be shifted past the '0', and the cost for each such shift (or group of shifts) is the length of the substring involved.

Here's how the function works with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `s = "10"`
  - Iteration 1: `i = '1'`, `one = 1`
  - Iteration 2: `i = '0'`, `one = 1`, `cost += 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Final cost: `2`

- **Example 2**: `s = "0000"`
  - No '1's followed by '0's, so `cost = 0`

- **Example 3**: `s = "11000"`
  - Iteration 1: `i = '1'`, `one = 1`
  - Iteration 2: `i = '1'`, `one = 2`
  - Iteration 3: `i = '0'`, `one = 2`, `cost += 2 + 1 = 3`
  - Iteration 4: `i = '0'`, `one = 0` (reset after '0')
  - Iteration 5: `i = '0'`, `one = 0`
  - Final cost: `3` (However, the correct cost should be `9` as per the example, which indicates that the logic might need re-evaluation.)

- **Example 4**: `s = "101011"`
  - Iteration 1: `i = '1'`, `one = 1`
  - Iteration 2: `i = '0'`, `one = 1`, `cost += 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Iteration 3: `i = '1'`, `one = 1`
  - Iteration 4: `i = '0'`, `one = 1`, `cost += 1 + 1 = 4`
  - Iteration 5: `i = '1'`, `one = 1`
  - Iteration 6: `i = '1'`, `one = 2`
  - Final cost: `4` (However, the correct cost should be `5` as per the example, indicating a need to re-evaluate the logic.)

- **Example 5**: `s = "01101001"`
  - Iteration 1: `i = '0'`, `one = 0`
  - Iteration 2: `i = '1'`, `one = 1`
  - Iteration 3: `i = '1'`, `one = 2`
  - Iteration 4: `i = '0'`, `one = 2`, `cost += 2 + 1 = 3`
  - Iteration 5: `i = '1'`, `one = 1`
  - Iteration 6: `i = '0'`, `one = 1`, `cost += 1 + 1 = 5`
  - Iteration 7: `i = '0'`, `one = 0` (reset after '0')
  - Iteration 8: `i = '1'`, `one = 1`
  - Final cost: `5` (However, the correct cost should be `11` as per the example, indicating a need to re-evaluate the logic.)

Given the discrepancies between the expected and actual costs in the examples, the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the string as described.
