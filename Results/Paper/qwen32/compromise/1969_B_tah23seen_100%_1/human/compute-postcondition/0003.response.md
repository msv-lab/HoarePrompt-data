To determine the output state after the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop given the initial state. The loop iterates through each character in the binary string `s`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `s` is a binary string.
   - `cost` is initialized to 0.
   - `one` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is `'1'`, increment `one` by 1.
     - If `i` is `'0'` and `one` is greater than 0, add `one + 1` to `cost` and reset `one` to 0.

3. **Effect Analysis**:
   - `one` keeps track of the number of consecutive `'1'`s encountered.
   - When a `'0'` is encountered and `one` is greater than 0, it means we've just ended a sequence of consecutive `'1'`s. The cost for this sequence is `one + 1` (the number of `'1'`s plus one), and `one` is reset to 0 to start counting the next sequence of `'1'`s.
   - If the loop ends and `one` is still greater than 0, it means the string `s` ends with a sequence of `'1'`s, and this sequence's cost (`one + 1`) is not added to `cost` during the loop. This sequence's cost will not be considered in the final `cost` unless we explicitly handle it after the loop (which is not done in the given code).

Given the above analysis, the final `one` value will be the count of consecutive `'1'`s at the end of the string `s` (if any). The `cost` will be the sum of `one + 1` for each sequence of consecutive `'1'`s followed by a `'0'`.

**Output State**: **`s` is unchanged; `cost` is the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'; `one` is the count of consecutive '1's at the end of the string `s` (if any).**

However, since the problem asks for the output state in the given format, we will represent it as follows:

Output State: **`s` is unchanged; `cost` is the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'; `one` is the count of consecutive '1's at the end of the string `s` (if any).**
