To determine what will be printed by the `print(j)` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: Greater than or equal to 1.
2. **n**: Greater than or equal to 1.
3. **a**: A list of integers derived from the new input.
4. **cntl**: A list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from 0 to `n`.
5. **cntl[0]**: Not equal to 0.
6. **j**: The value of `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is modified by `j + 2`.
7. **c**: The value of `c` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is modified by `c - 1`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(j)
```
The only operation on `j` mentioned in the initial state is `j + 2`. However, since there is no initial value provided for `j`, we can only infer that the `print(j)` statement will output whatever the value of `j` is after the operation `j + 2` has been applied.

### Conclusion:
Given that the problem does not specify the initial value of `j`, we can only describe the output in terms of the operation performed on `j`. Therefore, the output will be the value of `j` after it has been incremented by 2.

Output: **j (where j is the initial value of j plus 2)**
