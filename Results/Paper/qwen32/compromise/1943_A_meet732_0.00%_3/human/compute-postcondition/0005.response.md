The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at the `i`-th index of the `cntl` list by 1. Given the initial state, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros. After the code is executed, the value at `cntl[i]` will be 1, assuming it was 0 before the increment. The other elements of `cntl` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `cntl[i]` which is 1.**
