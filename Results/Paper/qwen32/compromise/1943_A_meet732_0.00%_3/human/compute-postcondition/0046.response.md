The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` in the list `cntl` by 1. Given that `i` is `a[1]`, the value at `cntl[a[1]]` will be increased by 1.

Initial State: 
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input and must have at least 2 elements
- `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is 2 and all other `cntl[j] for j != i` are 0
- `i` is `a[1]`

After executing `cntl[i] += 1`, the value at `cntl[i]` (which is `cntl[a[1]]`) will be 3, as it was initially 2 and is incremented by 1. All other elements in `cntl` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[a[1]]` is 3 and all other `cntl[j] for j != a[1]` are 0, `i` is `a[1]`**.
