Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from 0 to `n`. The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0.**
