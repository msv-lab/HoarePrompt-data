The code snippet initializes `cntl` to be a list of `n + 1` zeros. This means that all elements in `cntl` are set to 0, regardless of their previous values. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `cntl[i]` is 0.**
