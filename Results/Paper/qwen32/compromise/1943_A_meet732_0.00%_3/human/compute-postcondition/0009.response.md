Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least two elements, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `cntl[i]` which is 3, `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the value at index `i` in the list `cntl` has been incremented by 1, making it 3 instead of 2. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
