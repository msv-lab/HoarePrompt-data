The value of `k` is updated to the value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is `j`, `i` is `b + 2`, `a` is greater than `b + 2`, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second new input integer, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new input string, and the character `d[j]` is not in the substring `e[k:]`.

Output State: **`k` is `j`, `i` is `b + 2`, `a` is greater than `b + 2`, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second new input integer, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new input string, and the character `d[j]` is not in the substring `e[k:]`.**
