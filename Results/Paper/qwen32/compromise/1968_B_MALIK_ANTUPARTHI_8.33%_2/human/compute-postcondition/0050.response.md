Postcondition: **`k` is either `e.index(d[j]) + 1` if the character at index `j` of `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`, or `j` if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`. In both cases, `i` remains `b + 1`, `a` is greater than `b + 1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `1`, `c` is the second input integer, `d` is the third input string, and `e` is the fourth input string. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1` in the if part, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of in the else part.**
