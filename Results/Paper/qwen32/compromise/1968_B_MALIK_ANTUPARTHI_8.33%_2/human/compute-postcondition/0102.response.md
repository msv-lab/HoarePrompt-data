To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the given information step by step.

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `b` is the first new input integer.
   - `c` is the second new input integer.
   - `d` is the new input string.
   - `e` is the new input string.
   - `k` is defined as `e.index(d[b - 1]) + 1`.
   - `i` is defined as `b + 2`.
   - `a` is greater than `b + 2`.

2. **Understanding `k`:**
   - `k` is calculated based on the index of a character in string `e`. Specifically, it finds the index of the character `d[b - 1]` in string `e` and then adds 1 to it.
   - `d[b - 1]` is the character in string `d` at the position `b - 1` (0-based index).

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The exact value of `k` depends on the specific values of `b`, `d`, and `e`.
   - Without the specific values of `b`, `d`, and `e`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `k`.
   - However, we can describe the calculation precisely.

Given this, the output of the `print(k)` statement can be described as follows:

Output: **k (where k is e.index(d[b - 1]) + 1, with d[b - 1] being the character at index b - 1 in the string d and e being the new input string)**
