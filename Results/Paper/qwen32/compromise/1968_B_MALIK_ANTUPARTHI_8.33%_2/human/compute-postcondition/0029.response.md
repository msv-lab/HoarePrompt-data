Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user input; `j` is `j + 1`; `k` is either `e.index(d[j]) + 1` or `j + 1` if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, and in the latter case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
