Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. It then determines the maximum length of the prefix of string `a` that can be matched with a subsequence in string `b` without exceeding the length `m`. The function prints this length for each test case.**
