Output State: **`k` is `j`, `i` is `b + 1`, `a` is greater than `b + 1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `1`, `c` is the second input integer, `d` is the third input string, `e` is the fourth input string, and `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
