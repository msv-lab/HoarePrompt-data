The code snippet updates the value of `k` to be the index of the `j`-th character of the string `d` within the string `e`, plus 1. This means `k` will hold the position right after the found character.

Given:
- `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` remain unchanged.
- `d` is a string.
- `e` is the user input string.
- `j` is an index for `d`.
- Initially, `k` is 0.

The new value of `k` will be `e.index(d[j]) + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer; the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user input; `k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1`**.
