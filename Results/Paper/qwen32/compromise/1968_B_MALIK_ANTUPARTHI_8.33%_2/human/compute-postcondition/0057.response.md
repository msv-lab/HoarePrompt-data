The values of the variables do not change due to the `break` statement, but it indicates that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`k` is `j`, `i` is `b + 1`, `a` is greater than `b + 1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `1`, `c` is the second input integer, `d` is the third input string, `e` is the fourth input string, `j` is `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
