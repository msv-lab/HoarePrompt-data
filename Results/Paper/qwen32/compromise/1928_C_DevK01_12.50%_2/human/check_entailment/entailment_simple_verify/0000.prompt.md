You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Undefined Function `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is used in the code but is not defined. This will result in a `NameError` at runtime.

2. **Logic for Finding k Values:**
   - The logic to determine the values of k is not correctly implemented. The code uses a function `func_1` that is supposed to find divisors of a certain number, but the logic for determining which k values are valid is not clearly defined or correctly implemented.
   - The conditions and calculations for determining k values are not aligned with the problem description. For example, the calculation `y = n + x` and the condition `if y % 2 != 0` do not directly relate to the problem's requirements for finding k values.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, the problem specifies that k > 1, but the code does not explicitly enforce this constraint.
   - The code does not correctly handle the periodic nature of the settling pattern described in the problem. The pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions, and the code does not correctly implement this periodicity.

4. **Example Test Cases:**
   - The code fails to produce the correct output for some of the provided example test cases. For example, for the input `10 2`, the correct output should be `4` (k = 2, 3, 5, 6), but the code does not produce this output.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
