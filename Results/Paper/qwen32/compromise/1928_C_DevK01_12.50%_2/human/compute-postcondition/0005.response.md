The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `w`. The loop will execute if the range `(1, int(w // 1))` is not empty, which means `int(w // 1)` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `w` must be at least 2. 

Given the condition for `M` to be non-empty, `w` must also satisfy `w >= x - 1` for each tuple `(n, x)` in `q`. Since `w` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `x - 1 <= 2` for all tuples in `q`. This means `x` must be at most 3 for all tuples in `q`.

State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 3 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples, `w` is an integer where `w` is equal to `w // 1` and `w` is at least 2**
