Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. If `w` is an integer where `w` is equal to `w // 1` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.**
