### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each command and removing the appropriate element from the array while maintaining the product of the remaining elements. However, there is a critical flaw in the program's logic. Specifically, the program incorrectly tries to update the product by integer division (`ans = ans // arr[l]` or `ans = ans // arr[r]`), which does not correctly update the product when elements are removed from the array.

The correct approach should be to multiply the product by the modular inverse of the element being removed. This way, the product can be accurately updated without losing precision due to integer division. The modular inverse of a number `x` modulo `m` is a number `y` such that `(x * y) % m = 1`. This can be computed using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

However, the provided code does not implement this logic. Instead, it incorrectly uses integer division, which can lead to incorrect results, especially when the numbers are large or when the product becomes very large.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the logic of the provided program, the correct answer is:

**Correctness: False**

The program does not correctly compute the product after each removal, leading to incorrect results.
