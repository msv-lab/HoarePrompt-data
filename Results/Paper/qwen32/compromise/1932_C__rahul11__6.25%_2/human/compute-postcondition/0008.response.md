The code snippet `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Given that `ans` is initially 1, the new value of `ans` will be equal to `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is `i`.**
