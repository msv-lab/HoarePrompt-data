The code snippet provided reassigns the values of `n` and `m` based on the input. The initial state of `n` and `m` are overwritten with the new values provided by the input. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers; `s` is a list of characters; `res` is a list where the first element is `1 % m` and the next `n - 1` elements are the intermediate values of `ans % m % MOD` after each division; `ans` is 1; `c` is `n`; `l` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`; `r` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`.**
