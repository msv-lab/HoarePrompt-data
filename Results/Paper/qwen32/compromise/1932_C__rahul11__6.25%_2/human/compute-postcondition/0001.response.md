The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which should be the number of test cases, `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is the input to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, the input should be such that `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0, which is `t` in this case.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1, as the loop will execute `t` times.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
