The code snippet only assigns the value `1` to the variable `c`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are zeros; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`; `c` is 1.**
