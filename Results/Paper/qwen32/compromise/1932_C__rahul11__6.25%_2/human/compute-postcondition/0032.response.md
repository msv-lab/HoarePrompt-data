The code snippet provided increments the value of `l` by 1. Given the initial state, `l` is either 1 (if `s[k]` is 'L') or 0 (if `s[k]` is not 'L'). After the increment, `l` will be either 2 or 1, respectively.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element is `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`; `c` is 2; `l` is 2 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`; `s[k]` is either 'L' or not 'L'; `k` is `k + 1`.**
