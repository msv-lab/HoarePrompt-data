The only variable in the loop head is `k`. According to the loop statement `for k in range(n - 1)`, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was some value (let's denote it as `k_prev`). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be `k_prev + 1`, provided that `k_prev + 1` is still less than `n - 1`.

Given that the previous value of `k` was not specified explicitly, we can denote the new value of `k` as `k + 1` assuming `k` was the loop variable at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is either `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD` if `s[k]` is 'L', or `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD` if `s[k]` is not 'L'; `c` is 2; `l` is 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`; and `s[k]` is either 'L' or not 'L'; `k` is `k + 1`**
