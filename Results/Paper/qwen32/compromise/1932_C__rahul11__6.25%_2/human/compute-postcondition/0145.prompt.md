Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4; the array `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^4; the string `s` consists of `n` characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5; `MOD` is 1000000006.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(input())
    res = [0] * n
    ans = 1
    for i in arr:
        ans *= i
    res[0] = ans % m % MOD
    c = 1
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in range(n - 1):
        if s[k] == 'L':
            ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            l += 1
        else:
            ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            r -= 1
        c += 1
    print(*res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer; `arr` is a list of integers; `s` is a list of characters; `res` is a list where the first element is `1 % m` and the next `n - 1` elements are the intermediate values of `ans % m % MOD` after each division; `ans` is 1; `c` is `n`; `l` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`; `r` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element from index 0 to `n-1` contains the value of `ans % m % MOD` after each iteration; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by the elements at positions `l` to `r` (exclusive) in `arr`, modulo `MOD`; `c` is `n`; `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`; `r` is `n - 1 - (number of characters in s that are not 'L')`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the new input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by the appropriate elements in `arr` as specified by `s`, modulo `MOD`; `c` is `n`; `l` is the final value of `l` after processing all characters in `s`; `r` is the final value of `r` after processing all characters in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
