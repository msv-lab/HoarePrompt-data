The code snippet `ans *= i` updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with the current value of `i`. The value of `ans` was initially `i`, and after this operation, `ans` becomes `i * i` or `i^2`.

Given that `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one, we need to reflect this updated value of `ans` in the output state. The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `s` is a list of characters read from the new input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `0`; `ans` is `i * i`; `c` is `n`; `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`; `r` is `n - 1 - (number of characters in s that are not 'L')`; `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one.**
