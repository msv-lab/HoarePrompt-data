The code snippet `*_, k = R()` indicates that the function `R()` is called and its return value is unpacked. The `*_` syntax is used to capture all but the last element of the returned tuple (or list), which are ignored, and the last element is assigned to the variable `k`.

Given that `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, and `r` are not yet defined, and `t` is an integer with a specific value from the list returned by `R()` minus 1, the only variable that gets a value from this line of code is `k`.

Therefore, the output state will be:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, with a specific value from the list returned by `R()` minus 1; `k` is the last element of the list returned by `R()`.**
