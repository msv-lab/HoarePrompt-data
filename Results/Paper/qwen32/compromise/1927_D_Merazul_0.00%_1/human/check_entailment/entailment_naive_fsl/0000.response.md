Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a given range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \neq a_j\). If such a pair does not exist, the program should output \(-1 -1\).

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. It seems to be attempting some kind of set-based comparison and outputting "YES" or "NO" based on whether certain conditions are met, which is not what the problem is asking for.

Here is a breakdown of the issues with the program:
1. The program reads the input in a way that does not match the problem description. It reads the number of elements in the array and then tries to read the array and queries in a way that does not align with the expected input format.
2. The logic within the program does not correctly identify pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) where \(a_i \neq a_j\) within the specified range \([l, r]\).
3. The program outputs "YES" or "NO" instead of the required indices or \(-1 -1\).

Here is an example of how the program fails to meet the requirements:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  5
  1 1 2 1 1
  3
  1 5
  1 2
  1 3
  ```
- The program is expected to output:
  ```
  2 3
  -1 -1
  1 3
  ```
- However, the provided program does not produce these outputs and instead outputs "YES" or "NO" based on some incorrect logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
