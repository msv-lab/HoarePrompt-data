Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program's logic and variables do not align with the task of finding two different elements within the specified range for each query. Instead, the program seems to be checking if every integer from 1 to k (which is not even defined in the context of the problem) is present in either of two sets, `a` and `b`, and then printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on some conditions. This is unrelated to the problem's requirement to find two different elements in a subarray for each query.

The correct approach would involve iterating over each query, checking the subarray from index `l` to `r`, and finding two distinct elements. If such elements are found, their indices are printed; otherwise, `-1 -1` is printed.

Given the discrepancy between the provided code and the problem requirements, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
