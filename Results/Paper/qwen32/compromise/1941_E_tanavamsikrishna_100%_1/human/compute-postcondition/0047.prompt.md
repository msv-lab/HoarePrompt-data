You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and d is an integer representing the maximum distance between supports.
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: row[0] is 1, and row[i] for i from 1 to d-1 is each increased by 2.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: `row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `1 + 2*(i-1)`, `row[i]` for `i` from `d` to `len(row) - 1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1` where `e` is the first element in `min_heap` that meets the condition `e[1] > i - (d + 2)`, `min_heap` contains elements where the second value is greater than `i - (d + 2)` including the newly added elements `(row[i], i)` for `i` from `d` to `len(row) - 1`.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the final computed value of `row[-1]`, which is determined by the sum of the previous `row[i]` and the first element in `min_heap` that meets the condition `e[1] > i - (d + 2)` for `i` from `d` to `len(row) - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `row`, which is a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and a parameter `d`, which is an integer representing the maximum distance between supports. The function returns the final computed value of `row[-1]`, which is determined by summing the previous `row[i]` and the first element in `min_heap` that meets the condition `e[1] > i - (d + 2)` for each `i` from `d` to `len(row) - 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the final computed value of `row[-1]`, which is determined by the sum of the previous `row[i]` and the first element in `min_heap` that meets the condition `e[1] > i - (d + 2)` for `i` from `d` to `len(row) - 1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
