The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value, and it must still be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

Given that `costs` is a list of `n` elements, `len(costs)` is `n`. Therefore, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is `n - k + 1`. So, `i` must be less than `n - k + 1` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`, `total_costs` is a list containing two elements, the first is the sum of `costs[i-1:i-1 + k]` and the second is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we adjust `i` to `i + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`, `total_costs` is a list containing two elements, the first is the sum of `costs[i-1:i-1 + k]` and the second is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`, `i` is `i + 2`**.

However, the correct adjustment should be simply `i` is incremented by 1, so the correct state should be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`, `total_costs` is a list containing two elements, the first is the sum of `costs[i-1:i-1 + k]` and the second is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` is already `i + 1` from the previous iteration, the next iteration will have `i` as `i + 1` again, so we just need to ensure `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value.

The correct state at the start of the next iteration should be:
