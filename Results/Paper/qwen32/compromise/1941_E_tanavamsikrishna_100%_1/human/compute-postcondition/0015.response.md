To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head involves the expression `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`, which means the loop will continue as long as the index of the element popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Let's break down the current state and what needs to be adjusted:

1. **`min_heap`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `min_heap` is `[(1, 0), (3, 1), (5, 2), ..., (1 + 2*(d-1), d-1)]`. This means that each tuple in the heap contains a value and its corresponding index.

2. **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be at least `2d + 1`.

3. **`d`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `d` must be less than `len(row)`.

4. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as the index of the element popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that the index of the next element popped from `min_heap` satisfies the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

Since `min_heap` is a min-heap, the smallest element (in terms of the first element of the tuple) will be popped first. The index of the next element to be popped will be the smallest index that hasn't been popped yet. Given the current state of the `min_heap`, the next element to be popped will be `(1 + 2*d, d)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(1 + 2*d, d)[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must hold true. This simplifies to `d <= i - (d + 2)`, which further simplifies to `d <= i - d - 2` or `2d <= i - 2` or `i >= 2d + 2`.

Given that `i` must be at least `2d + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be at least `2d + 2` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to make `i` at least `2d + 2`.

State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is each increased by 2, `min_heap` is `[(1, 0), (3, 1), (5, 2), ..., (1 + 2*(d-1), d-1)]`, `d` must be less than `len(row)`, and `i` must be at least `2d + 2`**
