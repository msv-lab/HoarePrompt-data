To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the given initial conditions.

The loop iterates over the `costs` list, summing up `k` consecutive elements at a time and appending these sums to the `total_costs` list. The loop runs for `len(costs) - (k - 1)` iterations. Given that `costs` is a list of `n` elements, the number of iterations will be `n - (k - 1)`, which simplifies to `n - k + 1`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n.
   - `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m.
   - `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers.
   - `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`.
   - `total_costs` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - k`.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the sum of `k` consecutive elements in `costs` starting from index `i` and appends this sum to `total_costs`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `total_costs` will contain `n - k + 1` elements.
   - Each element in `total_costs` will be the sum of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`, `total_costs` is a list containing `n - k + 1` elements, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`.**

In simple terms, the `total_costs` list will have `n - k + 1` sums, each representing the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
