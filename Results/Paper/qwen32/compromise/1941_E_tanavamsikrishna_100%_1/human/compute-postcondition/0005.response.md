The code appends the sum of a slice of the `costs` list, specifically from index `i` to `i + k`, to the `total_costs` list. Given the initial state, `total_costs` was an empty list. After the execution, `total_costs` will contain one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`, `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`.**
