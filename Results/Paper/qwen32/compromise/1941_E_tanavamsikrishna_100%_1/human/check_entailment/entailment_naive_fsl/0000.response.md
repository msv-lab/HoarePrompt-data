Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a row while adhering to the distance constraint `d`. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the dynamic placement of supports with the minimum cost while ensuring that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

Let's consider a specific test case to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5 6 1 2
0 1 2 3 4 0
0 1 2 3 4 0
0 1 2 3 4 0
0 1 2 3 4 0
0 1 2 3 4 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
For each row, the optimal placement of supports is at columns 1 and 6 (river banks) and at column 3 (middle). The cost for each row is `0 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 4`. Since `k=1`, we only need to consider the minimum cost for one row, which is `4`.

**Actual Output from Provided Code:**
The provided code will not produce the correct output for this test case because it does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the minimum cost while respecting the distance constraint `d`. The logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the supports are placed optimally.

**Code Analysis:**
- The `func_1` function attempts to use a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports, but it does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the minimum cost while ensuring the distance constraint `d`.
- The `func_2` function correctly reads the input and calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, but since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall result is incorrect.

Therefore, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
