Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its correctness based on the given problem description, function summaries, and the original assessment.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to find the minimum cost of building `k` consecutive bridges over a river grid where each cell `(i, j)` has a depth `a_{i,j}`. The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`. Supports must be placed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost of building a bridge over a single row.
- **Implementation**:
  - Initializes the first `d` elements of the row.
  - Uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each cell.
  - Ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed `d` by maintaining a sliding window of size `d` using the heap.
  - Returns the cost of building the bridge over the entire row.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Purpose**: Read input values, process each row using `func_1` to get the cost of building a bridge over each row, and then calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows. Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among these configurations.
- **Implementation**:
  - Reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  - Processes each row using `func_1` to get the cost of building a bridge over each row.
  - Calculates the total costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
  - Prints the minimum total cost among these configurations.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Function `func_1` Analysis
- **Initialization**:
  - The first element is set to 1 (`row[0] = 1`).
  - The next `d-1` elements are incremented by 2 (`row[i] = row[i] + 2` for `1 <= i < d`).
- **Heap Usage**:
  - A min-heap is initialized with the first `d` elements.
  - For each cell from `d` to the end of the row, the function pops elements from the heap until it finds an element within the distance `d`.
  - The cost for the current cell is updated based on the minimum cost found in the heap.
  - The updated cost and the current cell index are pushed back into the heap.

**Issue in `func_1`**:
- The initialization of the first `d` elements is incorrect. The first element should be `row[0] + 1` (since a support must be installed there), and the subsequent elements should be initialized correctly based on the problem constraints.
- The loop `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):` is incorrect. It should be `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] < i - d:` to ensure that only elements within the distance `d` are considered.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis
- **Reading Input**:
  - Correctly reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
- **Processing Rows**:
  - Uses `func_1` to calculate the cost for each row.
- **Calculating Total Costs**:
  - Correctly calculates the total costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
  - Correctly finds the minimum total cost among these configurations.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Initialization and Cost Calculation**:
  - The initialization of the first `d` elements in `func_1` is incorrect, leading to incorrect cost calculations.
  - The sliding window mechanism using the heap is correct in principle but is implemented incorrectly due to the issues mentioned above.

- **Sliding Window**:
  - The sliding window mechanism is intended to ensure that the distance between supports does not exceed `d`, but the implementation details are flawed.

- **Total Costs Calculation**:
  - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the total costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them, assuming `func_1` provides correct costs.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of `func_1`, which leads to incorrect cost calculations for building bridges over each row. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
