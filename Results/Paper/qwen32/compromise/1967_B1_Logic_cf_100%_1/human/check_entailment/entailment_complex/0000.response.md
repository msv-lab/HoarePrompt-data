Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The program initializes `ans` with `n`. This implies that it assumes there is always at least one valid pair for each \(b = 1\), which is true since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and thus \(a + 1\) is trivially a multiple of \(1\).

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of \(b\):**
   - The program iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.

4. **Formula Explanation:**
   - The formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) seems to be derived from counting the number of valid \(a\) values for each fixed \(b\). However, the correctness of this formula needs verification against the problem statement.

### Verification Against Problem Statement:
- For a given \(b\), we need to count the number of \(a\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Let's denote \(\gcd(a, b) = d\). Then \(a = d \cdot x\) and \(b = d \cdot y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
- The condition becomes \(d \cdot x + d \cdot y\) is a multiple of \(d \cdot y \cdot d\), simplifying to \(x + y\) being a multiple of \(d \cdot y\).
- This further simplifies to \(x + y = k \cdot d \cdot y\) for some integer \(k\), or \(x = (k - 1) \cdot d \cdot y - y\).
- The number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\) and \(d\) should be counted correctly by the formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\).

### Conclusion:
- The provided program seems to follow a logical approach to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the derived formula.
- Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the formula appears to be correct in counting the valid pairs.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
