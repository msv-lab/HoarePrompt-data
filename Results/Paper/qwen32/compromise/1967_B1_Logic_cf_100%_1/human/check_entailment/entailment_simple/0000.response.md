### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The third condition can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]
\[ a \equiv -b \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]

This implies that \(a\) must be of the form:
\[ a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b \]
for some integer \(k\).

However, the provided program does not seem to implement this logic directly. Instead, it calculates the number of valid pairs using a different approach:
- It initializes `ans` with `n`.
- Then, for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to be based on a mathematical insight that simplifies the counting process. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: `ans = n`
   - This accounts for all pairs where \(b = 1\). Since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), the condition simplifies to \(a + 1\) being a multiple of \(b\), which is always true for \(b = 1\).

2. **Loop for \(b\) from 2 to `min(n, m)`**:
   - For each \(b\), the term \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) counts the number of valid \(a\) values for that specific \(b\).
   - This works because for each \(b\), \(a\) must satisfy \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), and the loop effectively counts these valid \(a\) values.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
  - `ans = 1` (only pair is \((1, 1)\))
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 2**: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
  - `ans = 2` (pairs \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\))
  - For \(b = 2\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{2 + 2}{2 \cdot 2} \right\rfloor = 1\) (pair \((2, 2)\))
  - Total: `3`
  - Output: `3`

- **Test Case 3**: \(n = 3\), \(m = 5\)
  - `ans = 3` (pairs \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((3, 1)\))
  - For \(b = 2\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 + 2}{2 \cdot 2} \right\rfloor = 1\) (pair \((2, 2)\))
  - For \(b = 3\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 + 3}{3 \cdot 3} \right\rfloor = 0\)
  - Total: `4`
  - Output: `4`

The program seems to produce the correct results for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
