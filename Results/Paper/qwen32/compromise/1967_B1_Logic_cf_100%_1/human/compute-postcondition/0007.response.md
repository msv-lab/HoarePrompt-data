To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

Given the loop:
```python
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) ≥ 2`
- `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`

In the loop, `b` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `b` had some value `b_prev`. At the start of the next iteration, `b` will be `b_prev + 1`.

Since `n` and `m` do not change within the loop, they remain the same. The value of `ans` is recalculated in each iteration based on the new value of `b`, but it does not affect the loop condition or the loop variable directly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` remains the same
- `n` remains the same
- `m` remains the same
- `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration

Assuming `b` was `b_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `b` becomes `b_prev + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) ≥ 2, `b` is `b_prev + 1`** 

However, since we don't know the exact value of `b_prev`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) ≥ 2, `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**
