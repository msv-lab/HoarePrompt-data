Given the initial state and the code snippet, here's the output state:

The variable `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Since `b` was incremented by 1 before this operation, the new value of `b` is used in the calculation. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**
