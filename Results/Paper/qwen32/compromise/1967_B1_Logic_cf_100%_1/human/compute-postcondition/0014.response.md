The code snippet reads two space-separated values from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This means that the previous values of `n` and `m` are overwritten by the new input values.

The other variables (`t`, `ans`, `T`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are the new input integers, `ans` is `n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b)) for b from 2 to min(n, m)`, `T` is incremented by 1**.
