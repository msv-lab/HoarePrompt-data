The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to the value of `n`. This means that the previous value of `ans` is overwritten by the value of `n`.

Other variables (`t`, `m`, `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are the new input integers, `ans` is `n`, `T` is incremented by 1**.
