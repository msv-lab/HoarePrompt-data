The only variable in the loop head is `T`, which is the loop variable iterating over the range of `t`. Therefore, we need to adjust only `T` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `T` has taken a value from 0 up to `t-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `T` should be incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and `ans` do not change based on the loop head and thus do not need adjustment here.

Given that `T` was previously `T-1` (or some value from 0 to `t-2`), it needs to be `T` (or `T-1 + 1`) for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers, `ans` is `n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b)) for b from 2 to min(n, m)`, `T` is incremented by 1**
