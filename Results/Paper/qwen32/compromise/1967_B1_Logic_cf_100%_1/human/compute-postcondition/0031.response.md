The only variable in the loop head is `b`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b` and the condition `min(n, m) + 1`. If `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `b` was some value, and it was incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Given that the loop runs from `2` to `min(n, m)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and it must still be less than `min(n, m) + 1`.

Since `T` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, it does not affect the loop condition directly and does not need adjustment for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) >= 2`, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1, `b` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific about the state of `b`:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was some value, say `k`.
- At the start of the next iteration, `b` becomes `k + 1`.

Therefore, if `b` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) >= 2`, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1, `b` is `b + 1`**.

Given that `b` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) >= 2`, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1, `b` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration**.

For simplicity, if we assume `b` was `k` and now it is `k + 1`, we can write:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) >= 2`, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1, `b` is `b + 1`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `b` from the previous iteration, we express it as `b + 1`.

Final State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) >= 2`, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1, `b` is `b + 1`**

However, to match the format of the previous examples, we can write:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) >= 2`, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1, `b` is incremented by 1**
