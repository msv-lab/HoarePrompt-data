Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of the list `a` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`; if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, `res` is 1, otherwise `res` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`.**
