To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(mdx, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
- `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- `res` is set to 1 if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise, `res` remains 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken some value in the range `[mdx, n-1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Since `n` does not change throughout the loop, it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `mdx` remains the same.
- `res` remains the same (unless the loop body modifies it, but we are only concerned with the loop head variables).
- `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`; `res` is set to 1 if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise, `res` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can express the state as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`; `res` is set to 1 if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise, `res` remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`; `res` is set to 1 if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise, `res` remains 0; `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Given that we do not have `i_prev`, we can generalize the state as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`; `res` is set to 1 if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise, `res` remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` is incremented by 1, we can write:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`; `res` is set to 1 if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise, `res` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`; `res` is set to 1 if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise, `res` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.
