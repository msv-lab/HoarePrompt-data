The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the input, regardless of its previous value. The initial state specified that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, but after this line of code, `n` will be whatever integer is input, and it will still satisfy the precondition that it is an integer within the range of 1 to 10^5.

The variables `t` and `a` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `t` remains an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4, and `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
