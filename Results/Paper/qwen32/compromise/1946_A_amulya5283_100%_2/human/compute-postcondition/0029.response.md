Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is `t - 1`: This suggests that `t` is being decremented by 1, but the exact value of `t` before this operation is not provided.
2. `n` is the length of the list `a`: This indicates that `n` is an integer representing how many elements are in the list `a`.
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9: This specifies the properties of the list `a`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or the contents of the list `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` do not influence the output of this particular `print` statement because it explicitly prints the number `1`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
