To determine the output of the `print(res)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `t`**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - However, it is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.

2. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `n` is not equal to 1.

3. **List `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

4. **Variable `mdx`**:
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - This formula can be interpreted as follows:
     - If `n` is odd, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2`.
     - If `n` is even, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2 - 1`.
   - In other words, `mdx` is the index of the middle element in the list `a` if `n` is odd, or the index of the element just before the middle if `n` is even.

5. **Variable `res`**:
   - `res` is the count of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
   - This means `res` counts how many elements starting from the middle (or just before the middle if `n` is even) are equal to the element at the `mdx` index.

### Determining the Output:

- Since `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, all elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]` will be consecutive.
- `res` will be the count of these consecutive elements starting from `mdx`.

### Final Output:

The value printed by the `print(res)` statement is the count of elements in the list `a` starting from the middle (or just before the middle if `n` is even) that are equal to the element at the `mdx` index.

Output: **res (where res is the count of elements in the list `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`)**
