Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5 for each test case; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for each test case.**

The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. The other variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
