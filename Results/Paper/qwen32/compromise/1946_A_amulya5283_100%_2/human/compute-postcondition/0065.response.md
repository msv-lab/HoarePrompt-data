Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the user input. If `n` is 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is the count of elements from `a[mdx]` to `a[n-1]` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**
