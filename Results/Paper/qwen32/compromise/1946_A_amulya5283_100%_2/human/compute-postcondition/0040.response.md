The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of the variable `res` by 1. The initial state specifies that `res` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`. After the increment, if `res` was initially 0, it becomes 1, and if `res` was initially 1, it becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the length of the list `a` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, `res` is 2, otherwise `res` is 1, `i` is `i + 2`**
