Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Let's examine why:

The current implementation sorts the array and then calculates the number of elements equal to the median in the second half of the array. However, it does not actually increase the median; it merely counts how many elements are equal to the current median. This count does not reflect the number of operations needed to increase the median.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Counting Instead of Increasing**: The code counts the number of elements equal to the median in the second half of the array, but it does not perform any operations to increase the median.
2. **Handling of Single Element Array**: The code prints `1` for a single-element array, which is incorrect. The median of a single-element array is the element itself, and increasing it requires one operation, but the problem specifies that the median should be increased, implying that the array should have more than one element to make sense of the median increase.
3. **Logic for Increasing Median**: The logic to determine the minimum number of operations to increase the median is completely missing. The code should increment the smallest elements necessary to ensure that the median increases.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the median.
3. Determine the minimum number of operations required to increase this median. This involves incrementing the smallest elements necessary to ensure that the new median is greater than the current one.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
1 2 2
```
The current code will output `1` because there is one element equal to the median (which is `2`) in the second half of the array. However, to increase the median, you need to increment the smallest element (`1`), which requires one operation. The new array would be `[2, 2, 2]`, and the new median would be `2`, which is not an increase. The correct output should be `1` (increment `1` to `2`), but the median should actually increase to `3` with two operations (increment both `1`s to `3`).

Thus, the current implementation is incorrect.
