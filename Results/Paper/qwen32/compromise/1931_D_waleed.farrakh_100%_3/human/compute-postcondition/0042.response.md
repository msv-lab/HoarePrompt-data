Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary that contains the tuple `(rx, ry)` as a key; `count` is 0; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`. The current tuple in `test_cases` has `(rx, ry)` that exists as a key in the `freq` dictionary.**
