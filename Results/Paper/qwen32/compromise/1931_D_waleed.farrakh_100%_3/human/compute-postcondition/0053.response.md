The given code snippet calculates `ry` as `a % y`. No other variables are directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, the state of `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, `current_pair`, `rx`, and `count` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` is a key in `freq`, then `count` is set to `freq[current_pair] + 1`. If `current_pair` is not a key in `freq`, then `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1 and `count` remains unchanged. `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`. `ry` is `a % y`.**
