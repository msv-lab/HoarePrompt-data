The provided code snippet updates the value of `arr` by converting the space-separated string from `data[idx + 1]` into a list of integers. Before the execution, `arr` is already defined based on the initial state, but the code redefines it based on the new input from `data`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0]) - 1` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `n` is the first integer from `data[3]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from `data[3]` split by spaces, `y` is the third integer from `data[3]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[idx + 1]` split by spaces and converted to integers.**

In natural language: The output state remains the same as the initial state except that `arr` is now specifically defined as a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the string at `data[idx + 1]`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
