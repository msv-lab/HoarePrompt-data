The code snippet sets the value of `freq[current_pair]` to 1. This means that if `current_pair` was already a key in `freq`, its value is overwritten to 1. If `current_pair` was not a key in `freq`, it is added with the value 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `freq` is a dictionary with `current_pair` as a key and its value set to 1; `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`**.
