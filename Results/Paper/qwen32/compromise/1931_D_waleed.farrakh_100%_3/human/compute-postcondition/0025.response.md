To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables mentioned.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`test_cases`**: A list containing `t` tuples.
2. **`data`**: A list of strings.
3. **`t`**: An integer equal to `int(data[0])`, which means `t` is the integer value of the first string in the `data` list.
4. **`idx`**: Calculated as `2 * t + 1`.
5. **`results`**: A list containing at least two elements.

### Key Points:
- The variable `result` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state. This suggests that `result` might be a typo or a variable that is defined elsewhere in the code, but it is not given in the context.
- Given that `result` is not defined in the provided initial state, we cannot determine its exact value based on the information given.

### Conclusion:
Since the variable `result` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed. Therefore, the output will depend on the actual value of `result` at the point of execution, which is not provided.

### Output:
Given the lack of definition for `result`, we can only state that the output will be the value of `result` at the time of execution.

Output: **result (where result is the value of the variable `result` at the time of execution)**
