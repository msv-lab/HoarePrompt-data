The code snippet `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. Given that the initial value of `idx` is 5, after the increment, `idx` will be 7. No other variables in the initial state are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing three tuples `((n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0]) - 2` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 7, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third integers from `data[5]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[6]` split by spaces and converted to integers.**
