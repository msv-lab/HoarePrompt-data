Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, two favorite integers `x` and `y`, and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It processes each test case to compute a count based on the remainders of elements in `arr` when divided by `x` and `y`. The function returns a list of these counts for each test case.**
