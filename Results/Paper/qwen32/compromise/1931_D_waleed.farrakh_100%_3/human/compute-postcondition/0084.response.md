The code snippet `freq[current_pair] = 1` sets the value of `freq[current_pair]` to 1. This means that if `current_pair` was not already in the `freq` dictionary, it will now be added with the value 1. If `current_pair` was already in the dictionary, its value will be overwritten to 1.

The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `arr`, `rx`, `ry`, and `current_pair` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `freq` dictionary.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and the first tuple from the previous iteration has been removed; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` after all iterations and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `(rx, ry)`, and now `freq[current_pair]` is 1; `arr` must have at least one element; `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)` and `(current_pair` is now in `freq` with the value 1)**.
