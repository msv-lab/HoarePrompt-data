The code snippet provided calculates the value of `ry` based on the modulus operation of `a` with `y`. The variables `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, `count`, and `rx` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Given that `ry` is calculated as `a % y`, the value of `ry` will be the remainder of the division of `a` by `y`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `a` or `y`, we express `ry` in terms of `a` and `y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is 0; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`.**
