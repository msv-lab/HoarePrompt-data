The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least two elements, and `result` will be the next element in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `idx` is `2 * t + 1`, and `results` is a list containing at least two elements**
