Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing Polycarp's first favorite integer), `y` (an integer representing Polycarp's second favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple; `results` is an empty list; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing Polycarp's first favorite integer), `y` (an integer representing Polycarp's second favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array). `results` is an empty list. `freq` is a dictionary that contains the key `current_pair` with an updated count. If `current_pair` was already in `freq`, its count is incremented by 1. If `current_pair` was not in `freq`, it is added with a count of 1. `count` is the updated count of `current_pair` in `freq`. `rx` is computed based on the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`. `ry` is the first element of the first tuple's array in `test_cases` modulo the second favorite integer `y` of that tuple. `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `freq` is a dictionary with an updated count for `current_pair`; `count` is the updated count of `current_pair` in `freq`. If `(rx, ry)` was already in `freq`, then `count` is incremented by `freq[(rx, ry)]` and `freq[(rx, ry)]` is incremented by 1. If `(rx, ry)` was not in `freq`, then `freq[(rx, ry)]` is set to 1 and `count` is set to 1. `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `freq` is a dictionary with an updated count for `current_pair`. If `current_pair` was already in `freq`, then `freq[(current_pair)]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `freq[(current_pair)]` is set to 1. `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
