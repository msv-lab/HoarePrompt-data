The code appends a new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are already defined from the initial state. Therefore, `test_cases` will now contain two tuples: the original one and the newly appended one.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing two tuples `((n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0]) - 1` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `n` is the first integer from `data[3]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from `data[3]` split by spaces, `y` is the third integer from `data[3]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[idx + 1]` split by spaces and converted to integers.**
