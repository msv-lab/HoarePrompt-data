The code snippet assigns the value of `(a % x, a % y)` to the variable `current_pair`. This means `current_pair` will now hold a tuple where the first element is the result of `a % x` and the second element is the result of `a % y`.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `count`, `rx`, `ry`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `(rx, ry)` is a key in `freq`, then `count` is set to `freq[rx, ry]`. If `(rx, ry)` is not a key in `freq`, then `count` remains unchanged. `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`**.
