Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, with the first tuple removed from the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` was already in `freq`, its value is incremented by 1. If `current_pair` was not in `freq`, it is added with the value `1`; `arr` must have at least one element; `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`.**

In this output state, the value of `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x`, where `a` is the next element in `arr` and `x` is presumably a previously defined variable. All other variables retain their initial state descriptions.
