You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a trace of a string, find any string `s` from which it could have been obtained.
- The trace is an array `a` of `n` integers where `a_i` is the number of such indices `j` (j < i) that `s_i = s_j`.
- The string `s` should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
- For each test case, a valid answer exists.

### Provided Program Analysis:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
    return s
```

#### Logic of the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `char_count` is an array of size 26, initialized to 0. This keeps track of how many times each letter has been used so far.
   - `s` is an empty string that will be built up to match the trace.

2. **Building the String**:
   - For each position `i` in the trace array `a`, the program looks for a character (from 'a' to 'z') whose count in `char_count` matches `a[i]`.
   - Once a suitable character is found, it is added to `s`, and its count in `char_count` is incremented.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed string `s` is printed for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- The program assumes that the first character to match the count will be the correct one. However, this assumption might not always hold because different characters may have the same count at different points in the string construction.
- The program does not guarantee that the constructed string will match the trace exactly for every possible input. For example, if multiple characters have the same count, the program will always choose the first one alphabetically, which may not be the correct choice to match the trace.

### Example to Prove Incorrectness:
Consider the trace `[0, 0, 1]`. The correct string could be `aba`, but the program might output `aaa` because it always picks the first character with the matching count.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not guarantee that it will always produce a string that matches the trace exactly for every possible input. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation of Why It Is Incorrect:
The program does not handle cases where multiple characters have the same count correctly. It always picks the first character alphabetically, which may not match the trace for some inputs. This can lead to incorrect string constructions.
