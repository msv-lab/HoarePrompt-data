Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `i` is 1. If `char_count[j] == a[i]`, then `s` is a string containing a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))` and `char_count[j]` is `a[i] + 1`. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros.**
