The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range `26`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, `j` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `s` is 'a', `char_count[j]` is `a[i] + 1`, and all other elements in `char_count` are 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` remains a list of 26 zeros.**
