Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `i` is 1, `j` is 3. If `char_count[j] == a[i]`, then `s` is `'d'` and `char_count[3]` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros.**
