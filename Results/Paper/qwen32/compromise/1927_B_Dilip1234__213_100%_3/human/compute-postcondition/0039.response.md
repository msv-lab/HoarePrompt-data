The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 25 (inclusive). Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, the loop variable `j` must be initialized to a value that allows the loop to start. Specifically, `j` should be initialized to 0.

Let's review the current state and adjust it accordingly:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n
- `s` is an empty string
- `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros
- `i` is 2

The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `j`. We need to set `j` to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
