The code increments the value at index `j` of the list `char_count` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, the value at index 1 of `char_count` will be incremented from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros except `char_count[1]` which is 1, `s` is 'b'**
