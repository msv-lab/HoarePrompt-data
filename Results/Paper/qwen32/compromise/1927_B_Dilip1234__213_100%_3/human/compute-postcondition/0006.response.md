The code snippet `char_count[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the `char_count` list by 1. Given the initial state, `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, so after the increment, `char_count[j]` will be `a[i] + 1`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `char_count[j]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `s` is 'a', `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 1` and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.**
