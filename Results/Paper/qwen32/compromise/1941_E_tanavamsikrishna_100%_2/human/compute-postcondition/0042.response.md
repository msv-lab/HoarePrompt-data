The code `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))` adds a new element to the `min_heap`. Given `i` is 2, `row[i]` is `row[2]` which is `2*e[0] + 1`. Therefore, the element `(2*e[0] + 1, 2)` is added to `min_heap`.

The values of `row[0]`, `row[1]`, `row[3]` and beyond, `e`, and `d` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains 2 as well. The only change is in `min_heap`, which now includes the new element.

Output State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` is `e[0] + 1`, `row[2]` is `2*e[0] + 1`, `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged, `min_heap` contains `e`, `e`, `(e[0] + 1, 1)`, and `(2*e[0] + 1, 2)`, `i` is 2, `d` is -1.**
