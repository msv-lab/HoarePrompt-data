To understand what will be printed, we need to break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state.

1. **Inputs and 2D List Construction**:
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are input integers.
   - `rows` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` where each element `a_{i, j}` is an integer input from the user.
   - The first and last elements of each row in `rows` are `0`, i.e., `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.
   - The function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, so we can't determine its exact behavior, but we know it processes each row and `d` to produce a cost value.

3. **Total Costs Calculation**:
   - `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of each consecutive `k` elements of `costs`, starting from the first element and ending at the last possible group of `k` elements.
   - Specifically, `total_costs` is constructed as follows:
     - For `i = 0` to `len(costs) - k`, `total_costs[i] = sum(costs[i:i+k])`

4. **Index `i`**:
   - `i` is defined as `len(costs) - k`, but it is not used in the `print` statement, so it is irrelevant to the output of `min(total_costs)`.

5. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement outputs the minimum value in the `total_costs` list.

Given the above steps, we can summarize the output of the `print` statement:

- The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum sum of any `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.
- Since the specific values of `costs` are not provided and depend on the behavior of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, we can describe it based on the given information.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of each consecutive k elements of costs, and costs is a list of values returned by func_1(row, d) for each row in rows)**
