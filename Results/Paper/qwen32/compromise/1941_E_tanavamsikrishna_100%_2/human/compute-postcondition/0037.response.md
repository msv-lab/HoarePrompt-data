To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the next iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition: `min_heap` and `i`.

The loop condition is:
```
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```
This means that for the loop to execute, the second element of the tuple `e` (retrieved by `heappop(min_heap)`) must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `row[0]` is 1
- `row[1]` is `e[0] + 1`
- `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`
- `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged
- `min_heap` contains `e` and `(e[0] + 1, 1)`
- `i` is 2
- `d` is -1

Let's analyze the condition:
- `e` is a tuple retrieved from `min_heap` using `heappop(min_heap)`.
- `e[1]` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

First, calculate `i - (d + 2)`:
- `i` is 2
- `d` is -1
- `i - (d + 2) = 2 - (-1 + 2) = 2 - 1 = 1`

So, `e[1]` must be less than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

The `min_heap` contains `e` and `(e[0] + 1, 1)`. Since `heappop` retrieves the smallest element, we need to ensure that the smallest element in `min_heap` has a second element (`e[1]`) that is less than or equal to 1.

Given that `min_heap` contains `(e[0] + 1, 1)`, and assuming `e` is the previously popped element, the condition `e[1] <= 1` must hold true for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the next `e` popped from `min_heap` has `e[1]` equal to 1. Since `min_heap` contains `(e[0] + 1, 1)`, and assuming `e` was `(some_value, some_value)`, the next `e` will be `(e[0] + 1, 1)`.

Thus, no further adjustment is needed to the state of `row` or `d`, as they do not affect the loop condition. The `min_heap` already contains the necessary element to satisfy the condition.

State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` is `e[0] + 1`, `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`, `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged, `min_heap` contains `e` and `(e[0] + 1, 1)`, `i` is 2, `d` is -1**
