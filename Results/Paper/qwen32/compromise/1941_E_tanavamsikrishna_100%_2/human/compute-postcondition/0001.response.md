The code snippet provided reads `n` lines of input, each line containing `m` integers, and constructs a 2D list `rows` from these inputs. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are input integers, and `rows` is a 2D list of integers with specific constraints. After executing the given code, the `rows` list will be updated to reflect the new input values, while `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, where each element a_{i, j} is an integer input from the user, and a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 for all i.**

In natural language: The value of `rows` is now a 2D list constructed from the input, with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is an integer provided by the user. The constraints that `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i` are still valid. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged.
