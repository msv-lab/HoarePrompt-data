Output State: **The program returns the last element of `row` which is updated based on the smallest element `e` from `min_heap` at each step.**

In this state, the last element of `row` has been updated multiple times based on the smallest elements from `min_heap`. Since the exact values of `row` and `min_heap` are not provided, we can only describe that the returned value is the final updated value of the last element in `row`.
