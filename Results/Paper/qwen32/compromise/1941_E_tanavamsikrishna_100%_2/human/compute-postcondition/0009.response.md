The code snippet appends the sum of elements from index `i` to `i + k` of the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list. Given that `i` is initially 2, the sum of elements from index 2 to `2 + k` (i.e., from index 2 to `k + 1`) of `costs` is calculated and added to `total_costs`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where each element `a_{i, j}` is an integer input from the user, and `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`; `rows` must have at least `k` rows; `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, the sum of the elements from index 1 to `k` of `costs`, and the sum of the elements from index 2 to `k + 1` of `costs`; `i` is 2.**
