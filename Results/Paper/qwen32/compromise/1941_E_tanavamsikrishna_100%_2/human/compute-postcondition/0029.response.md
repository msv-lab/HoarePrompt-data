The code updates the value of `row[i]` where `i` is 1. So, `row[1]` is updated to `e[0] + row[1] + 1`. Initially, `row[1]` is 0, so the new value of `row[1]` becomes `e[0] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` is `e[0] + 1`, `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`, `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged, `min_heap` is empty or contains elements that do not satisfy the loop condition, `i` is 1, `d` is -1.**
