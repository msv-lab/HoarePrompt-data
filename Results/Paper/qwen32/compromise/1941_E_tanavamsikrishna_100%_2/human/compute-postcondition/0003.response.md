The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `total_costs`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new state of `total_costs` while keeping the other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, where each element `a_{i, j}` is an integer input from the user, and `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`; `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`; `total_costs` is an empty list.**
