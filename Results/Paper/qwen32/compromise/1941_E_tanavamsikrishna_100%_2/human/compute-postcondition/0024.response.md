To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is true. Here, `e` is a tuple popped from `min_heap`, and we are interested in `e[1]` (the second element of the tuple) and `i` and `d` from the provided state.

From the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `row[0]` is 1
- `row[1]` is `e[0] + row[1] + 1`
- `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`
- `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged
- `min_heap` contains the element `(1, 0)` and the element `(row[i], i)`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `d` must be less than or equal to -1

Let's break down the condition:
- `e := heappop(min_heap)` pops the smallest element from `min_heap`. The smallest element in `min_heap` is `(1, 0)`.
- `e[1]` would be `0` after the first pop.
- The condition then becomes `0 <= i - (d + 2)`.

Given that `d` must be less than or equal to -1:
- Let's assume `d = -1` (the maximum possible value for `d`).
- Then the condition becomes `0 <= i - (-1 + 2)`, which simplifies to `0 <= i - 1` or `i >= 1`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, `i` will always be greater than or equal to 1, provided the loop has run at least once.

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that after the next `heappop`, the condition still holds. After the first pop, the next smallest element in `min_heap` is `(row[i], i)`. For the loop to continue, we need:
- `i <= i - (d + 2)` after the next pop.
- Given `d = -1`, this becomes `i <= i - 1`, which is not possible.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that the next element popped from `min_heap` satisfies the condition. Let's assume the next element popped is `(row[i], i)` and adjust `row[i]` and `i` accordingly.

Since `min_heap` initially contains `(1, 0)` and `(row[i], i)`, and we need the loop to execute one more time, we can adjust `row[i]` and `i` such that the condition holds. Let's assume `i` is currently 1 (after the first iteration), and we need to adjust `row[1]` to ensure the condition holds.

State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` is adjusted to a value such that `row[1] <= 1 - (d + 2)` when `i` is 1, `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`, `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged, `min_heap` contains the element `(1, 0)` and the element `(row[i], i)`, `i` is 1, `d` is -1**

Given `d = -1`, the condition becomes `row[1] <= 1 - (-1 + 2)` or `row[1] <= 0`. So, we need to adjust `row[1]` to be less than or equal to 0.

State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` is 0, `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`, `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged, `min_heap` contains the element `(1, 0)` and the element `(row[i], i)`, `i` is 1, `d` is -1**
