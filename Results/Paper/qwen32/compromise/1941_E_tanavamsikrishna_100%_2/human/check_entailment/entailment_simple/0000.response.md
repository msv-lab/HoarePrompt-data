### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to build `k` bridges over consecutive rows in a grid.
- Each bridge must have supports installed such that:
  - There is a support at the start and end of each row.
  - The distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`.
- The cost of installing a support at cell `(i, j)` is `a[i, j] + 1`.
- We need to minimize the total cost of installing all supports across the `k` bridges.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
   - This function computes the minimum cost to place supports in a single row.
   - It initializes the first `d` elements of the row with specific costs.
   - It then uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost to place supports, ensuring that the distance constraint between supports is maintained.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of placing supports in the last cell of the row.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the input parameters and the grid.
   - It computes the cost of placing supports for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It outputs the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

#### Correctness Check:
- **Initialization in `func_1`**:
  - The first `d` elements are initialized correctly to ensure the supports are placed at the beginning with the appropriate costs.
  
- **Heap Usage in `func_1`**:
  - The heap is used to efficiently find the minimum cost to place supports while respecting the distance constraint.
  - The heap ensures that the cost is updated correctly for each cell in the row.
  
- **Cost Calculation in `func_2`**:
  - The cost for each row is calculated independently using `func_1`.
  - The total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows is computed correctly.
  - The minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows is found and printed.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the constraints of the problem, including the minimum and maximum values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  - It also handles the condition that the first and last columns of the grid have a depth of 0.

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
