### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if it's correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to build `k` consecutive bridges over a river grid, minimizing the total cost of the supports. Each bridge spans a row, and supports must be installed at each cell in the row according to specific rules:
1. Supports must be installed at the first and last columns.
2. The cost of installing a support at cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
3. The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

#### Solution Analysis:
The solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - **Implementation**:
     - The first element of `row` is set to 1.
     - The next `d-1` elements are incremented by 2.
     - A min-heap is used to keep track of the smallest element in the window of size `d`.
     - For each element from index `d` to the end, it is updated based on the smallest element in the heap plus the current element plus 1.
     - The function returns the last element of the modified `row`.

   - **Issue**: The function does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost of installing supports. The logic for updating the row elements does not correctly account for the constraints and does not guarantee the minimum cost. Specifically, the way the heap is used and the cost calculation do not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Solve the problem for a given test case.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
     - Reads the `n` rows of the grid.
     - Calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of installing supports for that row.
     - Computes the sum of costs for every possible group of `k` consecutive rows.
     - Prints the minimum sum of these costs.

   - **Issue**: Since `func_1` is not correctly implemented, the costs calculated for each row are incorrect, leading to incorrect sums and, consequently, an incorrect minimum cost.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a row according to the problem's constraints. As a result, the overall solution does not provide the correct answer.

### Correctness: **False**
