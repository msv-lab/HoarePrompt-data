To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand how the loop processes each input time string. The loop converts each time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of time strings provided. For each iteration, it:
1. Splits the input string into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
2. Converts the 24-hour hour value to the corresponding 12-hour format and determines whether it is AM or PM.
3. Prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM/PM".

Let's consider the transformation rules:
- Hours from 00 to 11 remain the same in 12-hour format, with 00 being 12 AM.
- Hours from 12 to 23 are converted to 1 through 11 in 12-hour format, with 12 PM being 12 PM and 23 being 11 PM.

Given that the initial state provides `t` lines of input times, the output state will be `t` lines of times converted to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.

Since the exact input values are not provided, we can't list the exact output lines. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the transformation applied to each input line.

Output State: **For each of the t lines of input times in "hh:mm" 24-hour format, the output will be the corresponding time in "hh:mm AM/PM" 12-hour format.**
