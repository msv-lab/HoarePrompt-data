The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then prints a calculated value based on the conditions: if `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, it prints `2`; if `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, it prints `2 + m // b`; if `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, it prints `2 + m // a`; otherwise, it prints `m // a + m // b + 2`.
