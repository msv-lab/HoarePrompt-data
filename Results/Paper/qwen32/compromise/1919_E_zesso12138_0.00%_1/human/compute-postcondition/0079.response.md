The code snippet assigns the value of `p[-1] + offset` to `final_sum`. Given the initial state, `p[-1]` is the last element of the list `p`, which contains the sorted prefix sums of the array `a` and `offset` is `n`.

Therefore, `final_sum` will be the sum of the last element of `p` and `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers with non-zero values spread out from the initial position `dp[n]` after `n` iterations; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `final_sum` is `p[-1] + n`.**
