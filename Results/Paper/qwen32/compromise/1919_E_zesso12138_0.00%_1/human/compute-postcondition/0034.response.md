To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided information and the loop structure.

The loop iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. The key points from the problem statement are:

- The loop iterates as many times as there are elements in the `results` list.
- The variable `res` takes on the value of each element in `results` during each iteration.
- The loop prints `res` in each iteration.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until all elements in `results` have been printed. Therefore, the final output state will be when the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning it has printed every element in `results`.

Since the loop does not modify any variables outside of its body (i.e., it only prints `res`), the state of variables like `n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `result` remains unchanged from their last mentioned states in the problem description.

Thus, the final output state will be:

Output State: **The loop has printed all elements in `results`. `n` is the size of the last array `p` processed, `p` is the last array of integers derived from `data`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + t + sum of sizes of all arrays p`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished printing all the elements in the `results` list, and all other variables retain their values from the last described state.
