To determine the output state, we need to consider the effect of the line `result = func_1(n, p)`. This line calls a function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `p`, and assigns its return value to the variable `result`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is `2 + n`.
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `results` is an empty list.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` will hold whatever value `func_1(n, p)` returns.

Therefore, the updated output state includes the new variable `result` which holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is a positive integer; `results` is an empty list; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
