The code snippet updates the list `p` by mapping the slice of `data` from index `index` to `index + n` to integers. Given that `index` is 2 and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, the slice `data[2:2+n]` is converted to a list of integers and assigned back to `p`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2; `t` is a positive integer; `results` is an empty list**.
