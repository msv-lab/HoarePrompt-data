The code snippet increments the value of `index` by `n`. The values of `n`, `p`, `data`, `t`, `results`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` where each element is converted to an integer; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `4 + 2 * n + n`; `t` is 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
