The code snippet updates the list `p` by mapping the elements from `data[index:index + n]` to integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`
- `p` was initially a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `index` is `3 + n`
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `results` is a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
- `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`

After executing the code snippet:
- `p` is now a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
