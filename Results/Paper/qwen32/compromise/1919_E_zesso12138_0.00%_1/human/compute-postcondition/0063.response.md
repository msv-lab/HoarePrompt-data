Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, with `dp[j]` being greater than 0 if the condition `dp[j] > 0` is true, and all other elements of `dp` are initialized to 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `new_dp[0]` which is `(new_dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD` if `j` is hypothetically 1 (though this does not affect the current state since `j` is 0); `j` is 0. Since the condition `dp[j] > 0` is false (as `j` is 0 and `dp[0]` is 0), the state remains unchanged from the precondition.**
