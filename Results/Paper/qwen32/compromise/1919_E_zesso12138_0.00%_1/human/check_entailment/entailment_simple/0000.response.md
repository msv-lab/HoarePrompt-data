### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of initial arrays `a` that can result in a given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to achieve different prefix sums at each step.
   - `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach the prefix sum `j - n` (using an offset `n` to handle negative indices).
   - Initially, `dp[n] = 1` because there's one way to have a prefix sum of 0 (starting point).

2. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - For each element in the array `p`, the program updates the `dp` array to reflect the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum after adding either `+1` or `-1`.
   - This is done by iterating through the current state of `dp` and updating `new_dp` based on the possible transitions (`+1` or `-1`).

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the program looks up the number of ways to reach the final prefix sum `p[-1] + n` in the `dp` array.
   - This value is returned as the result for each test case.

4. **Handling Input and Output**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each one using `func_1`, and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

Let's verify the program against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [0]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No array `a` can result in a sorted prefix sum array `[0]`.
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [1]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Only `a = [1]` results in `p = [1]`.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No array `a` can result in a sorted prefix sum array `[-1, 1, 2]`.
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Three possible arrays `a` can result in `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.
   - Program Output: `3` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Only `a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]` results in `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of initial arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p` for all provided test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
