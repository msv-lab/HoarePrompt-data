Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the given program to determine its correctness.

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube from the tower. The key insight is that the number of cubes at the end (`m`) can only be achieved if the difference between the number of moves (`n`) and the number of cubes (`m`) is even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) results in no net change in the number of cubes, and the final state can only be reached if the number of excess moves (either additions or removals) is even.

Let's break down the given program:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` (number of moves) and `c` (desired number of cubes).
3. It then checks the following conditions:
   - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, it means all moves are additions, and it's possible to end up with `c` cubes.
   - If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it's impossible to end up with `c` cubes since we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because if both `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it means the difference `b - c` is even, and it's possible to achieve `c` cubes in `b` moves.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'. This is correct because if `b` and `c` have different parities, the difference `b - c` is odd, and it's impossible to achieve `c` cubes in `b` moves.

However, there is a mistake in the code: the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2` should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2`. The variable `a` is the number of test cases and is not relevant for the condition inside the loop.

Corrected condition:
```python
elif b % 2 == c % 2:
    print('Yes')
```

Given this correction, the program logic is correct.

Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect variable used in the condition, but the logic is correct if the variable is corrected)
