Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem asks whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes exactly one cube.

### Key Points
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Moves**:
   - Adding 1 cube: `+1`
   - Removing 1 cube: `-1`
3. **Final State**: We need to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
4. **Constraints**:
   - `0 <= m <= n` because we can't have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The difference between `n` and `m` must be even because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and thus, the parity (even or odd) of the number of cubes alternates with each move.

### Correctness Criteria
For a given `n` and `m`:
- If `n < m`, it's impossible because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, it's possible because we can make an even number of moves to adjust from 0 to `m` cubes.
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 != 0`, it's impossible because we can't achieve an odd difference with an even number of moves.

### Program Analysis
Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line does nothing and can be removed
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Issues in the Program
1. **Variable `a` Misuse**: The variable `a` (which holds the number of test cases) is incorrectly used in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2`. It should be `b % 2 == c % 2` to check the parity of `n` and `m`.
2. **Case Insensitivity**: The output should be in a consistent case (either all uppercase or all lowercase), but the program outputs "YES" and "Yes" interchangeably, which is acceptable per the problem statement but inconsistent.

### Corrected Logic
The corrected logic should be:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c and (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect due to the misuse of the variable `a` in the parity check. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
