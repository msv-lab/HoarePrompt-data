Reasoning: 

The provided program is not correctly addressing the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Path Construction**:
   - The program tries to construct the lexicographically smallest path by checking for the first occurrence where the cell below has a `0` and the cell to the right has a `1`. This does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest path.
   - The program does not consider all possible paths and their respective strings to determine the smallest one.
   - The logic to find the smallest string is flawed. The program does not explore all possible paths starting from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.

2. **Counting Paths**:
   - The program only counts paths based on a specific condition and does not correctly count all paths that yield the smallest string.
   - The variable `t` is assigned a value based on the first occurrence of a specific pattern in the string, which is not the correct way to count paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.

3. **Output**:
   - The output is not correctly generated as per the problem statement. The program does not ensure that the smallest string and the count of paths are correctly calculated and printed.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
