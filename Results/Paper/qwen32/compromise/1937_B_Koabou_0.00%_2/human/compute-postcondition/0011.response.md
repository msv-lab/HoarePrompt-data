To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Variable `s`**:
   - `s` is constructed based on a condition involving two strings `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
   - The condition looks for an index `i` where `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`.
   - If such an `i` is found, `s` is constructed as `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`.
   - If no such `i` is found, `s` is constructed as `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`, where `n` is the length of `a[1]`.

2. **Variable `x`**:
   - `x` is either the index `i` where the condition is met or `n - 1` if no such `i` is found.

3. **Variable `t`**:
   - `t` is either `1` or `x - i + 1` where the loop breaks. However, the loop and the exact value of `t` are not directly relevant to the `print(s, sep='')` statement.

Given the `print(s, sep='')` statement, we need to determine the exact value of `s` based on the conditions provided.

### Case Analysis:

#### Case 1: Condition is met at some index `i`
- Suppose `a[0]` and `a[1]` are such that there exists an index `i` where `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`.
- In this case, `s` will be `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`.
- `x` will be the value of `i`.

#### Case 2: No such index `i` is found
- If no such `i` exists, `s` will be `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`.
- `x` will be `n - 1`.

### Output Description:
Since the exact values of `a[0]` and `a[1]` are not provided, we can't compute the exact value of `s`. However, based on the conditions described, the print statement will output the constructed string `s`.

Output: **s (where s is constructed based on the conditions provided: either a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:] if an index i meets the condition a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0', or a[0] + a[1][n - 1] if no such i is found)**
