### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if it's possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that all containers end up with the same amount of water. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Calculate Total Water and Target:**
   - The program calculates the `total_water` as the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
   - It then computes the `target`, which is the amount of water each container should have if the water is evenly distributed. This is calculated as `total_water // n`.

2. **Check Redistribution Possibility:**
   - The program uses a variable `container` to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the `target`.
   - As it iterates through each container, it updates `container` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the `target`.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, the program returns 'No'. This is because a negative `container` would imply that more water has been poured out than poured in up to that point, which is not possible given the constraints of the problem (water can only be poured from a container to a container with a higher index).

3. **Final Check:**
   - If the loop completes without `container` going negative, the program returns 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The logic correctly checks whether it's possible to redistribute the water. If `container` ever becomes negative, it means there is a situation where more water has been poured out than poured in, which is not feasible under the given constraints.
  - If `container` never goes negative, it implies that the water can be redistributed in such a way that all containers end up with the `target` amount of water.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there is only one container (`n = 1`), where the answer is trivially 'Yes'.
  - It also correctly handles cases where the initial distribution of water already meets the target, in which case `container` remains zero throughout the loop.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
