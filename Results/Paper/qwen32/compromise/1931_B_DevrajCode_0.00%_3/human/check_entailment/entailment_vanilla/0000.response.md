Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective:** We need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from any container i to any container j where i < j.
2. **Constraints:** 
   - The sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times.
3. **Approach:** 
   - Calculate the target amount of water each container should have after the operation, which is `total_water // n`.
   - Check if it is possible to redistribute the water such that no container ever has less water than the target amount during the process of redistribution.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element in the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.
   - The program then calls `func_1(n, a)` to determine if the redistribution is possible.

2. **Function `func_1(n, a)`:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the total amount of water `total_water`.
   - **Step 2:** Check if `total_water` is divisible by `n`. This is already guaranteed by the problem, so this step is redundant but does no harm.
   - **Step 3:** Calculate the target amount of water each container should have `target = total_water // n`.
   - **Step 4:** Initialize a variable `container` to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target.
   - **Step 5:** Iterate through each container's water amount:
     - Update `container` by adding the difference between the current container's water and the target.
     - If `container` becomes negative at any point, return 'No'. This means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to meet the target for the current container.
   - **Step 6:** If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, return 'Yes'. This means that it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount.

3. **Logic Verification:**
   - The logic correctly checks if it is possible to redistribute the water without ever having a container with less water than the target. This ensures that the operation constraints (pouring from i to j where i < j) are respected.
   - The function returns 'Yes' only if it can ensure that the cumulative water level never goes below the target, which is a correct condition for the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly checks if it is possible to redistribute the water such that no container ever has less water than the target amount during the process. This ensures that the operation constraints are respected.
Correctness: **True**
