Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a list `a` of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`. The function returns 'No' in Case_1 and 'Yes' in Case_2.**
