Given the initial state and the code, we need to determine the output state. The code simply returns the string `'No'`. The initial state provides details about `n`, `a`, and `total_water`, but none of these variables affect the return value of the code snippet provided. The return statement is independent of these variables.

Output State: **The program returns 'No'**.
