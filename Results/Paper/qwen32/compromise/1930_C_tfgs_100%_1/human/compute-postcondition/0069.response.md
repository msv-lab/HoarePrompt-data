To determine the output of the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the provided information step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown
- **`n`**: Remains greater than 0 (though its exact value is not specified, it is positive).
- **`a`**: A list of elements (the exact elements are not specified, but we know its length is `i`).
- **`i`**: The length of the list `a`.
- **`counter`**: A dictionary where each element in `a` is a key with a value of -1.
- **`cur`**: Initialized to 0.
- **`cnt`**: Initialized to 0.
- **`ans`**: Initially contains all elements of `a` in their original order. During the loop, four additional elements are added based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`. Finally, an additional element is added which is the last element of the previous `ans` minus 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initialization of `ans`**: `ans` starts with all elements of `a` in their original order.
2. **Loop Execution**: During the loop, four additional elements are added to `ans`. These elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`. However, since the exact elements of `a` are not provided, we can't determine these specific differences.
3. **Final Element Addition**: After the loop, one more element is added to `ans`, which is the last element of the current `ans` minus 1.

### Output Description
Given the above analysis, the output of `print(*ans)` will be:
- All elements of `a` in their original order.
- Four additional elements calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.
- One final element, which is the last element of the previous `ans` minus 1.

Since the exact elements of `a` are not provided, we can't specify the numerical values of the additional elements. However, we can describe the structure of the output.

### Final Output
Output: **all elements of `a` in their original order, followed by four additional elements calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, and finally an element which is the last element of the previous `ans` minus 1**.
