The code `ans.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, which means `a[i]` is out of bounds for the list `a`. However, for the sake of this task, we will assume the code is executed under the precondition that `i` is a valid index for `a`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `ans` will now include an additional element `a[i]`.
- Other variables (`n`, `a`, `counter`, `cur`, `adv`, `cnt`) remain unchanged as per the given conditions.

Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0; `a` remains unchanged; if `i > 0`, `ans` includes `adv` additional elements: `a[i - 1] - 0 - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1` and now includes `a[i]`; `counter[a[i]]` is -1 for the specific `i`; `cur` is the sum of all `counter[a[i]]` values minus `adv`; `i` is equal to the length of `a`; `adv` is 0; `cnt` remains unchanged.**
