The code provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component into an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. 

Given the initial state, `n` is already defined as the length of the array `a`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are the elements of the array. After executing the given code, the list `a` will be populated with these integer elements.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the length of array `a`, and `a` is a list containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**
