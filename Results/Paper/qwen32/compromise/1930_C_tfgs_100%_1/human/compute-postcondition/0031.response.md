The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index that was just processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 so that it points to the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2; `ans` contains its previous elements plus `a[i]`; `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1; `cur` is increased by `counter[a[i]]; i` is incremented by 1**
