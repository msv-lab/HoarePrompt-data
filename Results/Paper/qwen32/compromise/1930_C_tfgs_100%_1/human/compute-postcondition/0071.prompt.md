You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array a, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` integers where `a_1` is `a_1 + 1`, `a_2` is `a_2 + 2`, `a_3` is `a_3 + 3`, ..., `a_n` is `a_n + n`, `i` is `n-1`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: `n` remains greater than 0, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `counter` has each element in `a` with a count of -1, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` contains all elements of `a` in their original order plus any additional elements calculated during the loop based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `n` remains greater than 0, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `counter` has each element in `a` with a count of -1, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` contains all elements of `a` in their original order plus four additional elements calculated during the loop based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, and an additional element which is the last element of the previous `ans` minus 1.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: all elements of `a` in their original order, followed by four additional elements calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, and finally an element which is the last element of the previous `ans` minus 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the elements of the array. It returns a value based on the elements of the array, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
