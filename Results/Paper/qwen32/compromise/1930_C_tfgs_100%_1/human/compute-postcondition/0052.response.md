The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `adv`, which means the loop has just finished executing all iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `adv`. Therefore, we need to reset `j` to 0 so that the loop can start a new iteration.

State: **`n` remains greater than 0; `a` remains a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2; `ans` now includes an additional element `a[i - 1] - j - 1`; `counter[a[i]]` will be -1 for the specific `i`; `cur` will be the sum of all `counter[a[i]]` values; `i` will be equal to the length of `a`; `adv` must be greater than 0; `cnt` is decreased by `adv`; `j` is 0**
