The provided code snippet reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `R`. This means that the variable `R` will now hold the list of integers read from the input, while all other variables (`t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, and `L`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 <= `M1`, `M2` <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5; The sum of all `N` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input.**
