Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 <= `M1`, `M2` <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of all `N` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`. `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The values of `t`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` remain unchanged.
