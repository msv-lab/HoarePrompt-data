Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
2. **Operation Details**: In each operation, we can choose any contiguous subarray, calculate its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array.
3. **Constraints**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Array size `n` and number of operations `k` can be up to `2 * 10^5`.
   - Each element in the array can range from `-10^9` to `10^9`.

### Strategy to Maximize the Sum:

1. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the initial sum of the array `s`.
2. **Finding Maximum Positive Subarray Sum**: Use Kadane’s algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray `t`. This subarray sum represents the most beneficial subarray to repeatedly add to maximize the total sum.
3. **Performing Operations**:
   - If `t > 0`, adding `t` repeatedly will increase the sum. Specifically, after the first operation, the new sum becomes `s + t`. For each subsequent operation, the added value doubles (since we are adding the sum of the previous additions).
   - If `t <= 0`, adding any subarray sum will not increase the total sum. In this case, the best strategy is to just keep the initial sum `s`.

### Implementation Details:

- **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, all calculations are done modulo `10^9 + 7`.
- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - Arrays with all negative elements (`t <= 0`): The result should simply be the sum of the array modulo `10^9 + 7`.
  - Arrays with positive elements (`t > 0`): The result should account for the repeated addition of `t` after each operation.

### Verification Against the Provided Program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The initial sum `s` of the array is calculated.
3. **Kadane’s Algorithm**: The program uses Kadane’s algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum `t`.
4. **Handling Operations**:
   - If `t > 0`, it calculates the new sum by adding `t` and doubling it for each subsequent operation.
   - If `t <= 0`, it simply outputs the initial sum `s`.
5. **Modulo Operation**: All additions and multiplications are performed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations. It handles both positive and negative subarray sums appropriately and ensures results are within the required modulo constraint.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
