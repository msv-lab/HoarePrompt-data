The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The new variable `a` is introduced and populated with integers from the input.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than `2`; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input.**
