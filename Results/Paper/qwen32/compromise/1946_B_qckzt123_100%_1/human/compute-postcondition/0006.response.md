The given code snippet assigns the value `0` to both `t` and `tmp`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but this value is overwritten by the assignment. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is the sum of the list `a`.**
