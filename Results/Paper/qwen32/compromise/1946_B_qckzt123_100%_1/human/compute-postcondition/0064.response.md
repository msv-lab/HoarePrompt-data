Output State: **T is greater than 2; n is an integer read from input; k is an integer read from input; a is a list of integers read from input; s is the sum of the elements in a; t is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within a; tmp is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative sums; ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is calculated using the formula `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial state.
