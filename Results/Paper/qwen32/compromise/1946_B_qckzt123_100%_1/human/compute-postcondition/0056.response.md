Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 2; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input that has at least one element; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is `max(tmp, 0)`; `x` is the next element in `a`. If `tmp` was less than 0, then `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.**
