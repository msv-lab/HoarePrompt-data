In the given task, the for loop iterates `T` times, where `T` is an integer read from the standard input. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop body.

To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variable `T`. The loop will execute if `T` is greater than 0. The variable `t`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), does not directly affect the execution of the loop since it is not referenced in the loop header.

Therefore, the only variable we need to adjust is `T` to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `T` must be greater than 0 for the loop to run at least once.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0**
