The given code snippet modifies the variable `t` by doubling its value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `2 * (t % MOD)`
- `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the last element or 0 if it was reset
- `T` is greater than 0
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `s` is the sum of the list `a`
- `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t` modulo `MOD`
- `i` is 2

After executing `t *= 2`, the new value of `t` will be `2 * (2 * (t % MOD))`, which simplifies to `4 * (t % MOD)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is `4 * (t % MOD)`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the last element or 0 if it was reset, `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2**.
