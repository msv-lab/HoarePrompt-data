Postcondition: **`t` is `max(0, 2 * x)`, `tmp` is `0` if `tmp` was initially less than 0, otherwise `tmp` remains `2 * x + x`. `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, and `s` is the sum of the list `a`. `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
