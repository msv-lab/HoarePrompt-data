`t` is multiplied by 2. The value of `t` was previously `(twice the maximum accumulated sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) % MOD`. After multiplying by 2, the new value of `t` is `((twice the maximum accumulated sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) % MOD * 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers where `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `((twice the maximum accumulated sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) % MOD * 2)`, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 1**.
