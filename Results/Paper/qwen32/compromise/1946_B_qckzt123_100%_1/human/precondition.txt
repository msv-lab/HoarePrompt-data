t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n and a list a. Here, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
