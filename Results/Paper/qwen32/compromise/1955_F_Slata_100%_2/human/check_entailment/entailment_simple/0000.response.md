### Reasoning:

To determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, we need to analyze the XOR operation on the sequence of numbers.

1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of two identical numbers is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice wins if the XOR of the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to determine the optimal sequence of removals for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero.
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each number that contributes a `1` in its binary representation (i.e., 1 and 3 for the least significant bit) is even.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Eve should aim to leave an even count of numbers that contribute a `1` in their binary representation.
   - Specifically, she should aim to leave an even count of 1s and 3s.
   - The count of 2s and 4s does not affect the least significant bit, so they can be ignored for the XOR being zero.

5. **Calculation**:
   - The maximum number of times Bob can win is the number of times Eve can remove numbers such that the remaining sequence has an even count of 1s and 3s.
   - This is equivalent to the number of pairs of 1s and 3s that can be removed, plus one more if there is an odd number of 1s and 3s left over (which can be paired with a 2 or 4 to make the XOR zero).

The formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` calculates this as follows:
- `a // 2 + c // 2` counts the number of pairs of 1s and 3s.
- `b // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs of 2s and 4s (though 4s do not affect the least significant bit, they are included for completeness).
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there is an odd number of 1s and 3s left over, which can be paired with a 2 or 4 to make the XOR zero.

Given this reasoning, the provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win.
