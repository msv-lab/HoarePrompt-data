To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version systematically.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each integer being 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
- Eve removes one number after each game until the sequence is empty.
- Eve wants Bob to win as many times as possible.
- Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code is:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

### Breakdown:
- `a, b, c, d` represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.
- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs for each number.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there is exactly one leftover of each number (1, 2, 3) after pairing, which would result in a XOR of 0.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Pairing Strategy**: The code correctly pairs each number, and each pair does not contribute to a non-zero XOR.
2. **Leftovers**: The code correctly identifies when there is exactly one leftover of each 1, 2, and 3, which would result in a XOR of 0. This is a key part of ensuring Bob wins.
3. **Edge Cases**:
    - **All numbers are paired**: In this case, the XOR is 0, and Bob wins.
    - **One leftover of each 1, 2, and 3**: The XOR is 0, and Bob wins.
    - **Other single leftovers**: The XOR is non-zero, and Alice wins.

### Testing with Example Cases:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `1 1 1 0`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One leftover of each 1, 2, and 3 is not possible, so Bob wins once when all numbers are paired.
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + int(3 == 3) = 1`

2. **Input**: `1 0 1 2`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Bob wins once when one 1 and one 3 are removed, leaving 2 and 4, which XOR to 0.
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + int(2 == 3) = 1`

3. **Input**: `2 2 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Bob wins three times by removing pairs optimally.
   - Calculation: `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + int(0 == 3) = 3`

4. **Input**: `3 3 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Bob wins three times by removing pairs optimally.
   - Calculation: `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + int(3 == 3) = 3`

5. **Input**: `0 9 9 9`
   - Output: `12`
   - Explanation: Bob wins twelve times by removing pairs optimally.
   - Calculation: `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + int(0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 == 3) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + int(2 == 3) = 12`

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the described cases correctly. It correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by pairing numbers and considering the optimal removal strategy.

### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the counts of numbers remain unchanged after processing each test case, and the logic correctly calculates the number of times Bob can win.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
