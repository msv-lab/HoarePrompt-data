To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the program's logic.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

### Key Observations:
1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Alice wins if the XOR of the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the sequence is zero.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**:
   - Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence has an XOR of zero as many times as possible.
   - To achieve this, Eve can pair numbers that cancel each other out in terms of XOR.

### Strategy:
- **Pairs of the Same Number**: Each pair of the same number (e.g., 1 and 1, 2 and 2) will cancel out to 0.
- **Odd Count Handling**: If there is an odd count of a number, one instance of that number will remain unpaired.
- **XOR of 1, 2, 3, 4**: 
  - XOR of 1 and 3 is 2.
  - XOR of 1 and 2 is 3.
  - XOR of 1 and 4 is 5 (which is 1 in binary, so it's equivalent to 1).
  - XOR of 2 and 3 is 1.
  - XOR of 2 and 4 is 6 (which is 110 in binary, so it's equivalent to 2).
  - XOR of 3 and 4 is 7 (which is 111 in binary, so it's equivalent to 3).
  - XOR of 1, 2, 3, and 4 is 4 (since 1^2^3^4 = 4).

### Program Logic:
The program calculates the number of pairs for each number (1, 2, 3, 4) and adds an additional win if there are three odd counts among the numbers (which would mean the XOR of the remaining numbers could be zero).

### Program Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```
- **`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`**: This part counts the number of pairs for each number.
- **`int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`**: This part checks if there are three odd counts among the numbers (a, b, c). If so, it adds one more to the count of Bob's wins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the pairs and the odd counts among the numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.
