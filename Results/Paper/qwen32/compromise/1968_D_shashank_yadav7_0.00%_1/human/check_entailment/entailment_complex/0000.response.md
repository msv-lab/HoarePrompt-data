### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python code and see if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1 from each.

2. **Initial Scores**:
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to `a[P_B]` and `a[P_S]` respectively.
   - The total scores (`bm` for Bodya and `sm` for Sasha) are initially set to `a[P_B] * k` and `a[P_S] * k` respectively. This suggests that the code assumes that both players will stay in their initial positions for all `k` turns, which is not necessarily the case.

3. **Simulation of Moves**:
   - The code then enters a loop to simulate the game for `k` turns.
   - In each iteration, it decrements `k` by 1.
   - If `k` reaches 0, the loop breaks.
   - It updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively.
   - The code then attempts to update the total scores `bm` and `sm` using the `max` function, but the logic here appears flawed. The `max` function is used incorrectly because it compares the current total score with a hypothetical future score (which is not the correct way to compute the total score). The correct approach would be to simply add the scores from the new positions to the total scores.
   - It also updates the initial scores `sp` and `bp` in each iteration, which is not necessary since the initial scores are only used to calculate the hypothetical future scores.

4. **Comparison of Scores**:
   - After the loop, the program compares the total scores `bm` and `sm` and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Issues in the Code:
- The use of the `max` function to update scores is incorrect. The scores should be updated by adding the scores from the new positions directly.
- The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are not needed after the first iteration and should not be updated in the loop.

### Corrected Approach:
- Initialize `bm` and `sm` to `a[P_B]` and `a[P_S]` respectively.
- For each turn, update the positions of Bodya and Sasha and add the scores from the new positions to `bm` and `sm`.
- After `k` turns, compare the scores and print the result.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the code, it is not implementing the correct logic as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
