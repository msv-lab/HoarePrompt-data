Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the logic for updating the scores and handling the moves is incorrect.

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Score Calculation Logic**:
   - The scores are not being updated correctly in each iteration. The lines `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` are incorrect. The scores should simply be incremented by the value at the current position in each turn.
   - The variables `bp` and `sp` are not used correctly. They seem to be intended to store the initial scores, but they are not needed if the scores are updated correctly in each iteration.

2. **Loop Control**:
   - The loop control logic is flawed. The loop should run exactly `k` times, and the scores should be updated in each iteration. The current code uses a decrementing `k` and breaks out of the loop when `k` reaches 0, which is correct, but the score updates are incorrect.

3. **Position Update**:
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated correctly by moving to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, but the score updates are not handled properly.

Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bm = a[b]
        sm = a[s]
        for _ in range(k - 1):  # k-1 because we already counted the initial positions
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

In this corrected version, the scores `bm` and `sm` are incremented by the value at the new position in each iteration, and the loop runs exactly `k-1` times to account for the initial positions already counted. This ensures that the scores are calculated correctly for both players after exactly `k` turns.
