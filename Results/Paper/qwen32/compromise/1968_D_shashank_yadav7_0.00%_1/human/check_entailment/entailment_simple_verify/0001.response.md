### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Recap:
- The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation array.
- On each turn, both players:
  1. Increase their score by the value at their current position in the array `a`.
  2. Optionally move to the position indicated by the current position in the permutation array `p`.
- After `k` turns, the player with the higher score wins. If the scores are equal, the game is a draw.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `b -= 1` and `s -= 1` convert the starting positions to zero-indexed.
   - `sp = a[s]` and `bp = a[b]` initialize the scores for Sasha and Bodya at their starting positions.
   - `bm = a[b] * k` and `sm = a[s] * k` are the initializations for Bodya's and Sasha's total scores after `k` turns, assuming they stay in their starting positions for all turns. This is incorrect because it assumes they do not move, which is not the case.

2. **Simulation Loop**:
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations, but the condition `if k == 0: break` ensures it stops after `k` iterations.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `k -= 1` correctly decrements the number of remaining turns.
     - `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1` update the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation array.
     - `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` are incorrect. These lines do not correctly simulate the game. Instead, they should simply add `a[b]` and `a[s]` to `bm` and `sm` respectively for each turn.
     - `sp += a[s]` and `bp += a[b]` are redundant and incorrect because the scores are already being updated correctly in the previous step.

3. **Comparison**:
   - After the loop, the program correctly compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.

#### Flaws in the Program:
- **Initialization**: `bm` and `sm` should be initialized to `bp` and `sp` instead of `bp * k` and `sp * k`.
- **Loop Logic**: The loop should execute exactly `k` times, and the score updates should be `bm += a[b]` and `sm += a[s]`.

#### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = bp
        sm = sp
        for _ in range(k):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis above, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed initialization and simulation logic. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
