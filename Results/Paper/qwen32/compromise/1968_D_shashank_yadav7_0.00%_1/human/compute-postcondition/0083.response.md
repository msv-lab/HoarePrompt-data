The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains the same as it determines the total number of iterations the loop should execute.

Given that `i` is currently 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` should remain greater than or equal to 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be at least 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b] - 1`, `sm` is `2 * a[s]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + bm`**
