To determine what will be printed by the `print('Draw')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

The initial state provides a detailed description of several variables and their relationships, but the specific values of these variables are not explicitly provided. The key points from the initial state are:

1. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. `i` is `min(n-1, initial_k - 1)`.
3. `n` is the first integer from the input.
4. `k` is `max(0, initial_k - i - 1)`.
5. `b` is updated `i` times based on `p`.
6. `s` is updated `i` times based on `p`.
7. `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
8. `sp` is `a[s] * (i + 1)`.
9. `bp` is `a[b] * (i + 1) - 1`.
10. `sm` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and a calculated expression for each iteration.
11. `bm` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and a calculated expression for each iteration.
12. `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
13. `bm` is equal to `sm`.

Given this information, the `print('Draw')` statement will simply output the string "Draw" regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `sm`, `bm`, and `p`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Draw**
