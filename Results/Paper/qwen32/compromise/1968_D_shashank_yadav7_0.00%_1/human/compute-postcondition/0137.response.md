Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s]`, `bm` is `max(bm, bp - a[b])`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part to consider.**
