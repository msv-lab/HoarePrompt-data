The code snippet `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the value of `k` is now `k - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - 1`, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `bp * (k - 1)`, `sm` is `sp * (k - 1)`**.
