The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string into an integer, and then stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `a`. None of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
