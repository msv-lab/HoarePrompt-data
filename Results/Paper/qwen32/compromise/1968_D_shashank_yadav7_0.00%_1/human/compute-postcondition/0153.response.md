Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `b` is the result of `k_initial` iterations of `b = p[b] - 1`, `s` is the result of `k_initial` iterations of `s = p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the accumulated maximum value after `k_initial` iterations, `bm` is the accumulated maximum value after `k_initial` iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` repeated `k_initial` times, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` repeated `k_initial` times`, `n`, `t`, `a`, `p`, `i` remain unchanged. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is strictly greater than `sm`. If `bm` is less than `sm`, then `bm` is strictly less than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is equal to `sm`.**
