To determine the output of the `print('Draw')` statement, we need to understand the context and the conditions under which this statement is executed.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise it is the value of `i` when `k` becomes 0.
- `n` is the number of iterations the loop was supposed to run.
- `k` is 0 if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise it is the value of `k` when the loop breaks.
- `s` is updated based on the values in the list `p` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0.
- `b` is updated based on the values in the list `p` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `sp` accumulates the values from the list `a` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0.
- `bp` accumulates the values from the list `a` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0.
- `bm` accumulates the maximum values based on the current `bp` and `sp` along with the values from the list `a` and the current value of `k` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0.
- `sm` accumulates the maximum values based on the current `bp` and `sp` along with the values from the list `a` and the current value of `k` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0.
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

The `print('Draw')` statement is executed without any conditions or checks on the variables. This suggests that the statement is intended to be executed under a specific scenario where none of the other possible conditions (presumably leading to 'Win' or 'Lose') are met.

Given the information, the only thing we can determine is that the control flow has led to this specific print statement, and no additional information about the variables' values is provided to infer any other conditions or outputs.

Therefore, the output of the `print('Draw')` statement is simply:

Output: **Draw**
