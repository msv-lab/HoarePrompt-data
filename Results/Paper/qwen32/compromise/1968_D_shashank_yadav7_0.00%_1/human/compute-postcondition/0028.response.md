To determine the output state, we need to focus on the impact of the given line of code on the variables:

The code line is:
```
bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
```

This line updates the value of `bm` by adding the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` to the current value of `bm`.

Given:
- `bm` is the current maximum value calculated.
- `a[b]` is an integer from the list `a` at the index `b`.
- `k` is an integer.
- `bp` is `2 * a[b]`.

Let's analyze the impact:
- `a[b] * k + bp` is a calculation involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp`.
- `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` will either be `bm` or `a[b] * k + bp`, whichever is larger.
- `bm` is then updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.

Since the exact values of `a[b]`, `k`, `bp`, and `bm` are not specified, we can express the updated value of `bm` in terms of these variables.

The updated value of `bm` can be written as:
- If `bm >= a[b] * k + bp`, then `bm += bm` which means `bm = 2 * bm`.
- If `bm < a[b] * k + bp`, then `bm += a[b] * k + bp`.

Therefore, the updated value of `bm` can be expressed as `bm = bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 1`, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is `p[p[original_b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `s` is `p[p[original_b] - 1] - 1`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
