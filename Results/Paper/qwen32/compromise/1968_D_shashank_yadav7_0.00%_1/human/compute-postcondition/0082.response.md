The code snippet `bp += a[b]` modifies the value of `bp` by adding the value of `a[b]` to it. 

Given the initial state, `bp` is initially `2 * a[b] - 1`. After the operation, `bp` becomes `2 * a[b] - 1 + a[b]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[b] - 1`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b] - 1`, `sm` is `2 * a[s]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + bm`**.
