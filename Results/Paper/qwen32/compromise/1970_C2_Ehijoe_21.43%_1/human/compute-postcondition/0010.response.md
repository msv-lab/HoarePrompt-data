Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is a node (integer) and each value is a list of integers representing the neighboring nodes; `start` is the integer value provided by the input; `moves` is a list of integers representing the number of moves required to reach each node from the starting node, as calculated by `func_1(nodes, start)`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor) from the `nodes` dictionary.**

In natural language: After executing the code, the `moves` list now contains the number of moves required to reach each node from the starting node, calculated by the function `func_1(nodes, start)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
