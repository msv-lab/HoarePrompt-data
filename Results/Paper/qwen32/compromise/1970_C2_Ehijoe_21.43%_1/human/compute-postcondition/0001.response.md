The code snippet initializes an empty list named `edges`. This action does not affect the values of `nodes`, `start`, `moves`, `n`, or `t`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding node; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game; `moves` is a list of integers representing the number of moves required to reach each node from the starting node; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list.**
