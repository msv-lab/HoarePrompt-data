Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is a node (integer) and each value is a list of integers representing the neighboring nodes; `start` is the integer value provided by the input; `moves` is a list of integers representing the number of moves required to reach each node from the starting node; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor) from the `nodes` dictionary.**

Explanation: The value of `start` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. All other variables retain their initial values.
