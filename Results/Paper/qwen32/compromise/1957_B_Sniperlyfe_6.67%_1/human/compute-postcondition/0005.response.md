Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list and `k` is an integer. The function returns a list `nums` containing `n` elements. Each element in the list except the last one is the largest number that can be represented with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits. The last element is the largest number that can be represented with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits plus `k`.**
