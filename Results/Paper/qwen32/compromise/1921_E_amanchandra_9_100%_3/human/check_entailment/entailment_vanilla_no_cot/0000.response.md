Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game for all possible scenarios. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Alice or Bob wins, or if the game ends in a draw, is flawed. The program incorrectly uses the distance between Alice and Bob's initial positions to determine possible moves and winning conditions, which doesn't account for the optimal strategies that both players can employ.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to consider the relative positions of Alice and Bob and the constraints of their movements. Here's a more accurate approach:

1. If Alice is already in the last row or Bob is already in the first row, the game ends in a draw.
2. If Alice can directly move to Bob's position or Bob can directly move to Alice's position, the respective player wins.
3. Otherwise, consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the distance between Alice and Bob's rows and columns to determine if Alice can force a win, Bob can force a win, or the game will end in a draw.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # If Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, it's a draw
        if x_a == h or x_b == 1:
            print('Draw')
            continue
        
        # If Alice can move to Bob's position or vice versa, the respective player wins
        if x_a + 1 == x_b and (y_a == y_b or y_a + 1 == y_b or y_a - 1 == y_b):
            print('Alice')
            continue
        if x_b - 1 == x_a and (y_b == y_a or y_b + 1 == y_a or y_b - 1 == y_a):
            print('Bob')
            continue
        
        # Determine the outcome based on the relative positions
        if (x_a + x_b) % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

func()
```

This program correctly handles the game logic by considering the optimal strategies for both players and the constraints of their movements.
