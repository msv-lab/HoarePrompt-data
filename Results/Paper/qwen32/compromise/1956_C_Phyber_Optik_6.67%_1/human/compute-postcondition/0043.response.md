Given the loop and the initial state, let's analyze the loop's behavior and determine the final output state.

### Loop Analysis
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + r + 1`.
- The condition for the loop is `j in range(1, n + r + 1)`.
- Inside the loop, there is a conditional statement that checks if `j <= n`.
  - If `j <= n`, it prints `1, j` followed by the range from 1 to `n`.
  - If `j > n`, it prints `2, j % n` followed by the range from 1 to `n`.

### Initial State
- `sum = 75`
- `r = 2`
- `n = 0` (as deduced from the output states after the first 3 iterations)

### Loop Execution
- Since `n = 0`, the loop will iterate from `j = 1` to `j = n + r + 1`, which is `1` to `3`.
- For each iteration:
  - When `j = 1`, `j > n` (since `1 > 0`), so it prints `2, 1 % 0` (which is undefined in Python, but since `n = 0`, this condition will not actually be reached because `j` will never be greater than `n` in this specific case). However, the logic dictates that it would print `2, 1 % 0` if `j > n`, followed by the range from 1 to `n` (which is just `1` to `0`, so nothing is printed for the range).
  - When `j = 2`, `j > n` (since `2 > 0`), so it prints `2, 2 % 0` (again, undefined in Python, but logically it would be `2, 0`), followed by the range from 1 to `n` (which is just `1` to `0`, so nothing is printed for the range).
  - When `j = 3`, `j > n` (since `3 > 0`), so it prints `2, 3 % 0` (again, undefined in Python, but logically it would be `2, 0`), followed by the range from 1 to `n` (which is just `1` to `0`, so nothing is printed for the range).

### Final Output State
- The values of `sum` and `r` remain unchanged throughout the loop iterations.
- The value of `n` remains `0`.
- The loop variable `j` will have gone through the values `1`, `2`, and `3` during the iterations.

### Conclusion
The final output state after the loop finishes executing is:
- `sum` remains `75`.
- `r` remains `2`.
- `n` remains `0`.
- `j` will have reached the value `3` at the end of the loop.

Output State: **sum = 75, r = 2, n = 0.**
