Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is equal to `i`.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `t` remains an integer representing the number of test cases and is at least 1, `n` remains at least 1, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `r` now holds the value of `i`.
