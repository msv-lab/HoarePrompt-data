Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, it calculates and prints a sum and a value `n + r`, followed by a series of lines describing operations on the matrix. The final state of the program after processing all test cases is the output of the calculated sums, values, and matrix operations for each test case.**
