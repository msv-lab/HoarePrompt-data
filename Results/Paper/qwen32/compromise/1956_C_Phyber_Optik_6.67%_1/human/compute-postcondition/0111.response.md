The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```
From the initial state, we know the following:
- `sum` is 90
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 2
- `j` is 1

The variable `j` is explicitly given as 1. The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function specifies that the output should end with a space instead of a newline.

Now, let's break down the `print` statement:
- The first argument is the integer `1`.
- The second argument is the variable `j`, which has the value `1`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the values `1` and `1` separated by a space, and the output will end with a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **1 1 **
