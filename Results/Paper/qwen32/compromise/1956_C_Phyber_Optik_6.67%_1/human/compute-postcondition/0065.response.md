Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

Initial State:
- `sum` is 110
- `r` is 1
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 1

The print statement is:
```python
print(sum, n + r)
```

Now, let's evaluate each part of the print statement:
1. `sum`: According to the initial state, `sum` is explicitly given as 110.
2. `n + r`: Here, `n` is 5 and `r` is 1. So, `n + r` equals 5 + 1, which is 6.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `sum` followed by the result of `n + r`.

Output: **110, 6**
