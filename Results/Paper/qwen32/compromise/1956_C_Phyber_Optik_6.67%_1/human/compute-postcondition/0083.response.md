Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the exact output.

Initial State:
- `sum` is 110
- `r` is 1
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 1
- `j` is 5

The code snippet is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Here's the breakdown of the expression `2, j % n`:
- The first part is the integer `2`.
- The second part is `j % n`, which is the modulus operation. It calculates the remainder of `j` divided by `n`.
  - Given `j` is 5 and `n` is 5, `j % n` is `5 % 5`, which equals `0`.

The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that the output should end with a space instead of the default newline.

Combining these, the `print` statement will output the integer `2`, followed by the result of `j % n` (which is `0`), with a space at the end.

Output: **2 0 **
