Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

Initial State:
- `sum` is 110
- `r` is 1
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 1
- `j` is greater than 5

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

We need to evaluate the expression `j % n`:
- We know that `j` is greater than 5, but we don't know its exact value.
- `n` is 5.
- The modulo operation `j % n` will give the remainder when `j` is divided by 5.

Since `j` is greater than 5, the possible values of `j % n` (where `n` is 5) could be any integer from 0 to 4, depending on the exact value of `j`. However, without the specific value of `j`, we can't determine a single exact value for `j % n`. But we do know it will be one of the values 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Given that the `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that the output should end with a space instead of a newline, the final printed output will be `2` followed by the result of `j % n` followed by a space.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **2 [j % n] ** (where [j % n] is the remainder when j is divided by 5, and j is greater than 5)
