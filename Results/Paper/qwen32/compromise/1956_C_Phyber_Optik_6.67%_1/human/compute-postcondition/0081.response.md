The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know the value of `j` is 5. The values of other variables (`sum`, `r`, `n`, `t`) are also provided but are not used in the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- The first argument to `print` is the integer `1`.
- The second argument to `print` is the variable `j`, which has the value `5`.
- The `end=' '` argument specifies that the output should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

Therefore, when the `print` statement executes, it will output `1` followed by `5`, separated by a space, and end with a space.

Output: **1 5 **
