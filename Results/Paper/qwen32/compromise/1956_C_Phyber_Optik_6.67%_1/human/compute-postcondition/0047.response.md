The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range `(1, n + 1)`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute because the range `(1, n + 1)` will include at least the number 1. The initial values of `sum`, `r`, and `t` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 1 when the loop starts, so we do not need to set it before the loop starts.

State: **`sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 1**
