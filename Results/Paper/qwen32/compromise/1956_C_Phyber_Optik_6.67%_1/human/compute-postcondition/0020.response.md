Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `r` is set to `i + 1` and `sum` is increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is increased by `i * n`.**
