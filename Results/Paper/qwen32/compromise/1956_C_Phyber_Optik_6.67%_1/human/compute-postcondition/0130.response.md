To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop and the provided output states for the first three iterations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` is read.
   - There are two nested loops:
     - The first nested loop calculates `sum` and `r` based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
     - The second nested loop prints specific values based on the value of `n + r`.

2. **Analyzing the Output States:**
   - **First Iteration:**
     - `sum = 75`
     - `r = 2`
     - `n = 0` (This seems incorrect given the sum and r values, as `n` should be greater than 0 for the loop to make sense. Let's assume a typo and recheck with other iterations.)
   - **Second Iteration:**
     - `sum = 110`
     - `r = 1`
     - `n = 5`
     - `t = 1` (This is not relevant to the inner loop state but confirms we have one more iteration.)
     - `j = 8` (This confirms the second loop runs `n + r + 1` times, i.e., 6 times for `n = 5` and `r = 1`.)
   - **Third Iteration:**
     - `sum = 90`
     - `r = 2`
     - `n = 5`
     - `t = 2` (This confirms we have one more iteration.)
     - `j = 7` (This confirms the second loop runs `n + r + 1` times, i.e., 7 times for `n = 5` and `r = 2`.)

3. **Calculating the Final Output State:**
   - Since `t = 2`, there are two test cases.
   - We already have the states for both test cases.
   - The final output state will be the state after the second test case.

Given the above analysis, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **sum = 90, r = 2, n = 5, t = 2, j = 7.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state is that `sum` is 90, `r` is 2, `n` is 5, `t` is 2 (indicating two test cases), and `j` is 7.
