Let's analyze the given task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `sum` is explicitly given as 75.
   - `r` is explicitly given as 2.
   - The variable `n` is not defined in the initial state. This means that `n` does not have an explicit value provided, and its value is unknown based on the given information.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum, n + r)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will output two values: the value of `sum` and the result of the expression `n + r`.
   - Since `sum` is explicitly given as 75, the first value printed will be 75.
   - The second value to be printed is the result of `n + r`. However, `n` is not defined, so we cannot compute `n + r` without knowing the value of `n`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - We can only determine the first part of the output, which is the value of `sum`, i.e., 75.
   - The second part of the output, `n + r`, cannot be determined because `n` is not defined.

Given the constraints, the output will be:
Output: **75, n + r (where n is an undefined variable)**
