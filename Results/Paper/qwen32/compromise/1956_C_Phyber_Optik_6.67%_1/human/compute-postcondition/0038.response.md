The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

From the initial state provided, we know the following:
- `sum` is 75
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 0
- `j` is 2

The `print` statement explicitly includes the integer `1` and the variable `j`. The `end=' '` argument specifies that the output should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

Since `j` is given to be 2, the `print` statement will output the integer `1` followed by the value of `j` (which is 2), separated by a space, and ending with a space as specified by the `end` parameter.

Hence, the output will be:
Output: **1 2 **
