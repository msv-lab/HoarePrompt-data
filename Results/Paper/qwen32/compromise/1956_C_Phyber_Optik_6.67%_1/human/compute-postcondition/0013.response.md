The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of the variable `sum` by adding the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. The variables `t`, `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is equal to `i`, `sum` is updated to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`.**
