The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` to the next value it should take in the loop.

Given that the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n + 1)`, `i` should be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration. Therefore, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was incremented by 1, it means we need to set `i` to the next integer value in the sequence.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to the next integer value in the range, which is `i + 1`. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted because it defines the upper limit of the loop range.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`**
