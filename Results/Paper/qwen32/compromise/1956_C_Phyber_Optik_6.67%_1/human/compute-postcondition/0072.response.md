To determine the output of the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement, we need to evaluate the `range` function with the given initial state.

### Given Initial State:
- `sum` is 110 (though this variable is not used in the print statement)
- `r` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement)
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement)
- `j` is greater than 5 (though this variable is not used in the print statement)

### Analysis:
The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement uses the `range` function. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from the first argument (inclusive) to the second argument (exclusive).

In this case:
- The start of the range is `1`.
- The end of the range is `n + 1`, which is `5 + 1 = 6`.

Thus, `range(1, 6)` generates the sequence of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

The `*` operator before `range(1, 6)` unpacks this sequence, so `print(*range(1, 6))` will print each number in the sequence separated by spaces.

### Output:
Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
