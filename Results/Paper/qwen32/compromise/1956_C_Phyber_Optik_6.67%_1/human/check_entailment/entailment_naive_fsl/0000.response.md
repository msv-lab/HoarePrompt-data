Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix using the allowed operations. Let's analyze the program and the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
- Two types of operations are allowed:
  1. Assign \( a_{i, j} = p_j \) for all \( 1 \leq j \leq n \) where \( p \) is a permutation of \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
  2. Assign \( a_{j, i} = p_j \) for all \( 1 \leq j \leq n \) where \( p \) is a permutation of \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to be attempting to calculate the maximum sum and the number of operations, but the logic is flawed and does not correctly implement the operations to achieve the maximum sum.

- The program calculates the sum and the number of operations in a way that does not guarantee the maximum possible sum.
- The operations described in the output do not necessarily maximize the sum.

#### Example to Demonstrate Incorrectness:
Let's consider the case when \( n = 2 \):

**Expected Output:**
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The maximum sum is 7, which can be achieved by setting the matrix as follows:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 \\
  1 & 2
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- The operations are:
  1. Set the first row to [1, 2].
  2. Set the second row to [1, 2].
  3. Set the first column to [1, 1].

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```

While the output for \( n = 2 \) happens to be correct, the program does not guarantee the correct output for all values of \( n \). Specifically, the logic used to calculate the sum and the operations is not robust and does not follow a clear strategy to maximize the sum.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum for all possible values of \( n \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
