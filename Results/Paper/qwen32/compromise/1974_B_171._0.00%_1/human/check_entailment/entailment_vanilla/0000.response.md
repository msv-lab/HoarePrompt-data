Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to decode a string that has been encoded according to the specified algorithm. However, the provided `func_1` function does not correctly implement the decoding process. Let's break down why the program is incorrect:

1. **Building the Mapping**: The decoding process requires understanding the mapping between characters in the encoded string and the original string. This mapping is based on the distinct characters in the original string (sorted alphabetically) and their symmetric counterparts.

2. **Incorrect Mapping Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to build a mapping by assigning the first unused character from 'a' to 'z' to each character in the encoded string. This logic does not reflect the correct mapping based on the distinct characters in the original string.
   - It does not construct the auxiliary string `r` (distinct characters of the original string in alphabetical order) and does not map characters symmetrically based on this string `r`.

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - The decoding process should first identify the distinct characters in the encoded string, sort them alphabetically, and then map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in this sorted list.
   - The provided function does not perform these steps correctly and instead assigns characters in an arbitrary manner.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example `serofedsoc`, the correct decoding process should first identify the distinct characters `cdefors`, map them symmetrically, and then decode the string accordingly to get `codeforces`.
   - The provided function does not perform this symmetric mapping and will likely produce incorrect results.

Given these points, the program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
