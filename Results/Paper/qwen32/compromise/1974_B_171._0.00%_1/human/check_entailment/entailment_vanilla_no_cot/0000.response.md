Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not construct the auxiliary string `r` consisting of distinct letters of the encoded string in alphabetical order and then use it to map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in `r`. Instead, it attempts to build a mapping by assigning the first available character from 'a' to 'z' that hasn't been used yet, which is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = decode(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def decode(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Find distinct characters in the encoded string and sort them
    r = sorted(set(encoded))
    # Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric character
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    # Decode the encoded string using the mapping
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

This corrected program first constructs the string `r` by finding all distinct characters in the encoded string and sorting them. It then creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`. Finally, it decodes the encoded string using this mapping.
