Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string as described in the problem statement. The main issue lies in the way the mapping from encoded characters to original characters is constructed. The program does not accurately determine the correct mapping based on the distinct characters of the original string `s` sorted in alphabetical order and their symmetric replacements.

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

Here's why this code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Mapping Construction**: The code attempts to construct a mapping by assigning the first available unused character from 'a' to 'z' to each new character in the encoded string. This does not follow the described algorithm where characters are mapped based on their symmetric positions in the sorted distinct characters of the original string.

2. **No Symmetric Character Replacement**: The code does not compute the string `r` (distinct characters of the original string sorted alphabetically) and does not perform the symmetric character replacement as described in the problem statement.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the issue:

**Example:**

Encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`.

According to the problem statement, the decoding should work as follows:

1. Determine `r` from the encoded string by first finding the distinct characters and sorting them alphabetically.
2. Map each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.

For the given encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`, the distinct characters in alphabetical order would be `r = "cdefors"`. The symmetric mapping would be:

- 's' -> 'c'
- 'e' -> 'd'
- 'r' -> 'o'
- 'o' -> 'f'
- 'f' -> 'e'
- 'd' -> 'r'
- 'c' -> 's'

Using this mapping, the decoded string should be `s = "codeforces"`.

However, the provided code does not perform this mapping correctly and would likely produce an incorrect result.

**Counterexample:**

For the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`, the provided code might produce something like `"codeforces"` but not necessarily due to the incorrect mapping logic. However, for other strings, it will definitely produce incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
