Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. `mapping` is a dictionary, and if `chr(c)` (which is 'b') is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` will have an entry `mapping['b'] = char`. `decoded` is a list that may have been updated. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
