The code attempts to append the value of `mapping[char]` to the `decoded` list. Given the initial state, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, which means that `mapping[char]` will raise a `KeyError` because `char` does not exist in `mapping`. However, the precondition states that `char` is a character that exists in the `mapping` dictionary, which implies that there should be no `KeyError` under the given conditions.

Since `char` exists in `mapping`, `decoded.append(mapping[char])` will successfully append the corresponding value of `char` from the `mapping` dictionary to the `decoded` list.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is a list containing the value `mapping[char]`, and `char` is a character that exists in the `mapping` dictionary.**
