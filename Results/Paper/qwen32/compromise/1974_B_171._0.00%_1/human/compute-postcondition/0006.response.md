In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over a range of ASCII values corresponding to the lowercase Latin letters ('a' to 'z'). The loop variable `c` will take on each value in this range during each iteration. 

The state before the loop starts includes `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `char`. However, only the objects in the loop head can be adjusted. The loop head here is `c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)`, which means the variables `c` and the range `range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)` are the only ones we can adjust.

Since the range is from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which covers all lowercase Latin letters, the loop will always execute as long as the range is correctly defined. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the range itself, but we can specify the initial value of `c` to be within this range.

The loop variable `c` will be automatically initialized to the starting value of the range (`ord('a')`) before the first iteration, so we do not need to adjust `c` before the loop starts.

Thus, the only thing we need to ensure is that the range is correctly defined, which it already is. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `mapping`**
