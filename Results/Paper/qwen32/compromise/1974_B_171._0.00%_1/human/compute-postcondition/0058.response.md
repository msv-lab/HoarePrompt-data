To understand the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the process:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `mapping` is an empty dictionary.
   - `decoded` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each character `char` in `encoded`:
     - If `char` is already in `mapping`, append `mapping[char]` to `decoded`.
     - If `char` is not in `mapping`, find the smallest letter `c` (from 'a' to 'z') that is not yet a value in `mapping`, add `{'c': char}` to `mapping`, and append `c` to `decoded`.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - After processing all characters in `encoded`, `decoded` will contain a transformed version of `encoded` where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `mapping` will contain a mapping of each unique character in `encoded` to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `encoded` remains unchanged.

Given this understanding, the final output state is:

Output State: **`encoded` is unchanged, `mapping` contains a one-to-one mapping of each unique character in `encoded` to a unique character from 'a' to 'z', and `decoded` is a list of characters where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding character in `mapping`.**

In simpler terms, `decoded` will be a transformed version of `encoded` where each unique character in `encoded` is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z', and `mapping` will show how each character in `encoded` was transformed.
