Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping` is either `{'a': char}` or `{'b': char_next}`, `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)`, `char` is `char_next`, and `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` is in `mapping.values()`, the behavior is undefined and `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
