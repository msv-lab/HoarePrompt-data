To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the variables involved:

- `encoded`: This is a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. It remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `mapping`: Initially, it is either an empty dictionary or contains one entry `{'a': char}`. The loop will update this dictionary to map each subsequent lowercase letter to `char` until it finds a letter that is not already a value in `mapping`.
- `decoded`: This list contains the value `mapping[char]` if `char` exists in `mapping`, or `chr(c)` if `char` does not exist in `mapping`. It is stated to contain `chr(c)` in the descriptions of the output states after the first few iterations, implying it is not directly affected by the loop's internal logic.
- `char`: This variable is `char_next` and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `c`: This variable iterates over the ASCII values of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

The loop iterates over the ASCII values of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' (97 to 122). For each value `c`, it checks if `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`. If it is not, it adds `chr(c): char` to `mapping` and breaks the loop.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration, if `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` will be `{'a': char}` if it was empty, or it will remain `{'a': char}` and `c` will be 98.
- After 2 iterations, if `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` will be `{'a': char, 'b': char_next}` if it was `{'a': char}`, or it will remain `{'a': char}` and `c` will be 99.
- After 3 iterations, if `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` will be `{'a': char, 'b': char_next, 'c': char}` if it was `{'a': char, 'b': char_next}`, or it will remain `{'a': char, 'b': char_next}` and `c` will be 100.

The loop will continue until it finds a letter that is not already a value in `mapping`. Since `mapping` can only contain one value (which is `char`), the loop will stop after mapping the first letter that is not already mapped.

If `mapping` initially contains `{'a': char}`, the loop will map 'b' to `char` and then stop because `char` is already a value in `mapping`. If `mapping` is initially empty, the loop will map 'a' to `char` and then stop.

Therefore, the final state of `mapping` will be `{'a': char}` if `mapping` was initially empty or `{'a': char, 'b': char}` if `mapping` was initially `{'a': char}`. However, since the loop breaks as soon as it maps a character to `char`, the final state of `mapping` will be `{'a': char}` if it was initially empty, or it will be `{'a': char, 'b': char}` if `mapping` was initially `{'a': char}`. But in the general case where the loop runs to completion (i.e., until it finds a character not already mapped), the final state will be `{'a': char}` if `mapping` was initially empty, or `{'a': char, 'b': char}` if `mapping` was initially `{'a': char}`.

Since the problem does not specify the initial state of `mapping` beyond it being either empty or `{'a': char}`, we consider the most general case where `mapping` is initially empty. Therefore, the final state of `mapping` will be `{'a': char}`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is `{'a': char}`, `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)`, `char` is `char_next`.**
