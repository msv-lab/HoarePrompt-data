Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `c` is 99, `mapping` is either `{'a': char}` or `{'b': char_next}`, `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)`, `char` is `char_next`. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` is updated to include `{'c': char}` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mapping`.**
