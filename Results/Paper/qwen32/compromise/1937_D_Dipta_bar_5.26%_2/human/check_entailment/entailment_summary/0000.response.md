### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position in the string `s`. The approach involves using two arrays, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative movements to the right and left, respectively. However, there are a few issues with the provided code that make it incorrect for the problem at hand.

1. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the cumulative movements and the final time for each starting position is flawed. The code attempts to use the arrays `A` and `B` to store cumulative movements but does not correctly account for the inversion of characters after each move.
   - The formula used to calculate the final time for each starting position involves incorrect indices and does not accurately represent the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Lack of Clear Explanation**:
   - The code does not provide a clear explanation of how the cumulative movements are calculated and how they are used to determine the final time for each starting position.
   - The code also does not handle the edge cases where the pinball might leave the grid immediately or where the movements are more complex.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The code does not produce the correct output for the given example. For instance, for the input `"><<"`, the expected output is `3 6 5`, but the code does not produce this output.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**

To solve this problem correctly, a more straightforward approach would involve simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position and keeping track of the time taken until the pinball leaves the grid. This approach would involve iterating through the grid for each starting position, updating the grid after each move, and counting the number of moves until the pinball leaves the grid.
