After carefully analyzing the provided program, I found several issues that suggest it does not correctly implement the problem description for all potential cases. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Index Handling**: The program uses `idx_A` and `idx_B` to store indices of '>' and '<' respectively. However, the logic for calculating the time taken by the pinball to leave the grid is incorrect and does not properly account for the changes in the grid after each move.

2. **Logic for Pinball Movement**: The program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the characters in the grid. It seems to use a complex formula that does not accurately represent the described behavior.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as grids with only '<' or only '>', or grids where the pinball moves back and forth without leaving the grid.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the results for each test case on a new line, which is not in compliance with the problem description. The results for each test case should be printed on the same line separated by spaces.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Here is a counterexample:

**Counterexample:**
```
Input:
1
3
><>
Output:
2 4 2
Expected Output:
2 3 2
```

In this counterexample, the program incorrectly calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for the second cell. The correct simulation shows that the pinball should leave the grid in 3 seconds, not 4.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the characters in the grid. It fails to handle certain cases and does not produce the correct output format.
