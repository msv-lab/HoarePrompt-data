Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by maintaining two lists, `A` and `B`, which are used to track the cumulative movements of the pinball when starting from cells with '>' and '<' respectively. The program also maintains indices `idx_A` and `idx_B` to keep track of the positions of the cells with '>' and '<'. The core idea is to use these lists to compute the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

Let's break down the key steps of the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the length of the grid `n` and the grid string `s` are read.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is called to process the grid string `s`.

2. **Processing '>' Characters**:
   - For each cell `i` in the grid, if the character is '>', it calculates the cumulative movement time and stores it in the list `A`.
   - The index `i` is also stored in the list `idx_A`.

3. **Processing '<' Characters**:
   - For each cell `i` in the grid, starting from the end, if the character is '<', it calculates the cumulative movement time and stores it in the list `B`.
   - The index `i` is also stored in the list `idx_B`.

4. **Calculating Output for Each Cell**:
   - Two pointers `l` and `r` are used to keep track of the current positions in the lists `A` and `B`.
   - For each cell `i` in the grid:
     - If the character is '>', it calculates the total time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid by combining the values from `A` and `B`.
     - If the character is '<', it calculates the total time similarly.
   - The calculated time is printed for each cell.

However, the provided code has several issues:

- The logic for calculating the cumulative movement times in `A` and `B` is incorrect. The formula used to calculate `x` in the lists `A` and `B` is not correct and does not reflect the actual movement of the pinball.
- The logic for combining the values from `A` and `B` to calculate the total time is also incorrect. The formula used to calculate the total time does not correctly account for the number of movements and inversions.
- The code does not handle the case where the pinball leaves the grid immediately, which is possible if the first character in the grid is '>' or the last character is '<'.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
