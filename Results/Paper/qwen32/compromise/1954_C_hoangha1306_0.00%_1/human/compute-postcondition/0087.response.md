Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is the new string provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of `b`, then `kq1` is the character at index `i` of `a` and `kq2` is the character at index `i` of `a`; otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and if `vt` was originally 0, then `vt` is now 1. If `vt` was 0 and the integer value of `a[i]` is greater than the integer value of `b[i]`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`; otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not 0, then `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.**
