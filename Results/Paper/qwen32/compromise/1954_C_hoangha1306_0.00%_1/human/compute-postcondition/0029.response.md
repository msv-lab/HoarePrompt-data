Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + a[i]`.**

Natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000. The string `a` remains unchanged and has at least 1 character. The string `b` is still the string provided by the next user input. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1. The variable `kq1` is now equal to its previous value plus the character at index `i` of the string `a`.
