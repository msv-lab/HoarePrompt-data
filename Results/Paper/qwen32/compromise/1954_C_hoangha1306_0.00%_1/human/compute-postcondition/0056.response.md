Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`. If `vt` was 0, then `vt` is now 1. If `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
