Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `q` is `q + 1`. If the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` is the string containing the character `a[i]` and `kq2` is the string `a[i]`; otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is 1 if it was 0, and `kq1` and `kq2` are set based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]`: `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y` if `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.**
