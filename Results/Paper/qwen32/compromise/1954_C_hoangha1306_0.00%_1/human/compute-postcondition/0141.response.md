The code snippet concatenates the string representation of `x` to `kq2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a new string provided by the user input with length at least 1; `b` is a new string provided by the user input; `kq1` is a string containing the value of `y`; `kq2` is a string containing the value of `str(x)`; `vt` is 1; `q` is `q + 1`; the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `a[i]` is less than or equal to `b[i]`.**
