Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input. If the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the character at index `i` of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` if `vt` was 0, otherwise it is the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the string representation of `y` if `vt` was 0, otherwise it is the string representation of `x`, and `vt` is set to 1 if it was 0.**
