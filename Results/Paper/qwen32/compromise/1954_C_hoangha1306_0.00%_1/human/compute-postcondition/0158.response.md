Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `q` is `q + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `vt` is 1; if `a[i] > b[i]`, then `kq1` is `kq1` + str(x) and `kq2` is `kq2` + str(y); otherwise, `kq1` is `kq1` + str(y) and `kq2` is `kq2` + str(x).**
