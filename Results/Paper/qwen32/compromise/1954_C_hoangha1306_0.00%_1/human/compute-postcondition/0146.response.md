Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a new string provided by the user input with length at least 1; `b` is a new string provided by the user input; `q` is `q + 1`; the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. If `vt` was 0, then `vt` is now 1, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` if the character at index `i` in `a` is not greater than the character at index `i` in `b`, otherwise `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `y` if the character at index `i` in `a` is not greater than the character at index `i` in `b`, otherwise `kq2` is the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not 0, then `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.**
