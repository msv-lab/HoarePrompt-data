The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the string `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is the new string provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 1**.
