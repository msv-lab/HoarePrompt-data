The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + a[i]` appends the character `a[i]` to the string `kq2`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `q`, `i`, and `kq1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `q` is `q + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `kq1` is a string that has been updated to include the character `a[i]` appended to it; `kq2` is a string that has been updated to include the character `a[i]` appended to it.**
