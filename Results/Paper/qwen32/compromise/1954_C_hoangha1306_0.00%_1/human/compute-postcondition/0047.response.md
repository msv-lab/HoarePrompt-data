Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the new state after the code is executed.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `a` is a string with at least 1 character
- `b` is the string provided by the next user input
- `i` is incremented by 1

The code snippet:
```python
x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
```

Impact:
- `i` is already incremented by 1 before this code snippet.
- `a[i]` and `b[i]` are accessed, converted to integers, and then `min` and `max` functions are used to assign values to `x` and `y`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1, we can assume that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are valid indices for the strings `a` and `b` respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`.**

In natural language: The integer `t` remains the same, the strings `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `x` and `y` are assigned the minimum and maximum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`, respectively.
