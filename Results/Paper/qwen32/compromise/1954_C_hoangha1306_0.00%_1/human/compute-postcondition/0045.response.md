The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `a` to the string `kq2`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, while `kq1` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the character at the new index `i` of string `a`, and `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the character at index `i` of string `a`.**
