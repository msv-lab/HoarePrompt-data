The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + a[i]` appends the character at the `i`-th position of string `a` to the string `kq2`. 

Given that `kq2` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `kq2` will contain the character `a[i]`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `kq1`, `vt`, and `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `kq1` is a string containing the character `a[i]`; `kq2` is the string `a[i]`; `vt` is 0; `q` is `q + 1`. The characters at the `i`-th position of `a` and `b` are equal.**
