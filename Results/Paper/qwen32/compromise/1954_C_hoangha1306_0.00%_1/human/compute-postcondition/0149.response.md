The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` adds the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `kq1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `q` is `q + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `kq1` is a string that has been updated to include the character `a[i]` appended to it.**
