Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either `l[x]`, `l[x-1]`, or `float('inf')`, `b` is either `l[x]`, `l[x-2]`, or `float('inf')`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `n` is greater than 0. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `x` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.**
