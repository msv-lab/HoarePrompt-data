Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `x` is incremented by 1. If `a` was originally greater than `b`, then `a` holds the original value of `b` and `b` holds the original value of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
