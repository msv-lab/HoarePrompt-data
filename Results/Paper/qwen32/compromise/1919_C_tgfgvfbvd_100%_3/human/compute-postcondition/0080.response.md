The code provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. This means that the initial state information about `a`, `b`, and `c` is no longer directly applicable because the list `l` has been reassigned.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
