Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is 0. Additionally, `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`. The current value of `a` remains `float('inf')` and `b` remains `float('inf')`. The value of `c` remains 0.**
