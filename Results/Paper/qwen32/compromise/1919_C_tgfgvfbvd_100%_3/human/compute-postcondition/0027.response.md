Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is incremented by 1. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `a` was greater than `b` after this update, `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`, `b` is set to the initial value of `a`, and `c` is incremented by 1.**
