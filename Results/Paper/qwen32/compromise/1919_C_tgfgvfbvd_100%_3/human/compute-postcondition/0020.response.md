The code snippet `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. However, the initial state provided does not mention the initial values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, we can only state that after the execution of the code, `a` will have the value that `b` had initially, and `b` will have the value that `a` had initially. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `x`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `x + 1`; `a` is the initial value of `b`; `b` is the initial value of `a`.**
