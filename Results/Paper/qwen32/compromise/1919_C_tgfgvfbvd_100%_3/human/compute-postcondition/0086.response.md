Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If `a` is greater than `b`, the condition is true, but no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, the condition is false, and no changes are made to the variables.**
