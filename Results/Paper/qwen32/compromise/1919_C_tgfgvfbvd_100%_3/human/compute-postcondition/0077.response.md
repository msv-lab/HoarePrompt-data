To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

1. `a` is the smallest element in the list `l`.
2. `b` is the second smallest element in the list `l`.
3. `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

The `print(c)` statement will output the value of `c`.

Since the exact list `l` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `c`. However, we can describe `c` in terms of the list `l`:

- `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are strictly greater than both `a` and `b`.
- `a` and `b` are the two smallest distinct elements in `l`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements.

Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements in `l`)**
