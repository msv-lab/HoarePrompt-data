The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is some value (let's assume it is `x-1` since we are moving to the next iteration), and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will have `x` incremented by 1.

State: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either `l[x-1]` or `float('inf')`, `b` is either `l[x-1]` or `float('inf')`, `c` is either 0 or 1, and `n` is greater than 0, `x` is `x + 1`**
