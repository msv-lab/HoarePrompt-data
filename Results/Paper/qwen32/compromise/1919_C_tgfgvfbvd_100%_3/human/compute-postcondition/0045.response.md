Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0, and `a` is greater than `b`.**

In natural language: After entering the if condition, `t` remains an integer within the range of 1 to 10,000, `n` is still greater than 0, `l` is still the list of integers provided by the input, `a` and `b` both remain `float('inf')`, and `c` remains 0. Additionally, `a` is greater than `b`.
