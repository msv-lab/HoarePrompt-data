Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is positive infinity; `b` is positive infinity; `c` is 0; `a` is greater than `b`.**

In simple terms: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive; `n` is an integer that is at least 1; `l` is a list of integers; `a` and `b` are both positive infinity, with `a` being greater than `b`; `c` is 0.
