You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these counts, which seems to represent a specific derived count related to the input numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. 

Let's analyze the logic of the given code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```
The code calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by taking the integer division of each count of numbers (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s) by 2, summing these values, and then adding 1 if the sum of the remainders of these counts when divided by 2 equals 3.

However, this logic does not correctly account for the XOR operation and the optimal strategy for Eve to remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins. Here are some reasons why the code is incorrect:

1. **XOR Operation**: The code does not correctly simulate the XOR operation on the sequence of numbers. The XOR of a sequence of numbers is non-zero if and only if the count of numbers with each bit position set to 1 is odd. The current code does not consider the XOR operation at all.

2. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**: The code does not implement an optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins. The strategy should involve removing numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as many times as possible. The current code does not implement this strategy.

3. **Incorrect Assumptions**: The code assumes that the maximum number of times Bob can win is simply the sum of half the counts of each number plus one if the sum of the remainders equals 3. This assumption is incorrect and does not account for the XOR operation or the optimal strategy for Eve.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the removal of numbers and calculate the XOR of the remaining numbers to determine if Bob wins. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the initial XOR
        current_xor = (1 if a % 2 else 0) ^ (2 if b % 2 else 0) ^ (3 if c % 2 else 0) ^ (4 if d % 2 else 0)
        bob_wins = 0
        
        # If the initial XOR is zero, Bob wins
        if current_xor == 0:
            bob_wins += 1
        
        # Total numbers
        total_numbers = a + b + c + d
        
        # Eve removes one number at a time
        for _ in range(total_numbers):
            if current_xor == 0:
                bob_wins += 1
            
            # Eve removes one number optimally
            if a > 0:
                a -= 1
                current_xor ^= 1
            elif b > 0:
                b -= 1
                current_xor ^= 2
            elif c > 0:
                c -= 1
                current_xor ^= 3
            elif d > 0:
                d -= 1
                current_xor ^= 4
        
        print(bob_wins)

func()
```

This corrected code correctly simulates the removal of numbers and calculates the XOR of the remaining numbers to determine if Bob wins. It also implements an optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.
