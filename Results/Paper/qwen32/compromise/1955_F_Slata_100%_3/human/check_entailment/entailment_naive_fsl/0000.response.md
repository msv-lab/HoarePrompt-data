Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. 

Let's analyze the logic of the given code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```
The code calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by taking the integer division of each count of numbers (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s) by 2, summing these values, and then adding 1 if the sum of the remainders of these counts when divided by 2 equals 3.

However, this logic does not correctly account for the XOR operation and the optimal strategy for Eve to remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins. Here are some reasons why the code is incorrect:

1. **XOR Operation**: The code does not correctly simulate the XOR operation on the sequence of numbers. The XOR of a sequence of numbers is non-zero if and only if the count of numbers with each bit position set to 1 is odd. The current code does not consider the XOR operation at all.

2. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**: The code does not implement an optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins. The strategy should involve removing numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as many times as possible. The current code does not implement this strategy.

3. **Incorrect Assumptions**: The code assumes that the maximum number of times Bob can win is simply the sum of half the counts of each number plus one if the sum of the remainders equals 3. This assumption is incorrect and does not account for the XOR operation or the optimal strategy for Eve.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the removal of numbers and calculate the XOR of the remaining numbers to determine if Bob wins. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the initial XOR
        current_xor = (1 if a % 2 else 0) ^ (2 if b % 2 else 0) ^ (3 if c % 2 else 0) ^ (4 if d % 2 else 0)
        bob_wins = 0
        
        # If the initial XOR is zero, Bob wins
        if current_xor == 0:
            bob_wins += 1
        
        # Total numbers
        total_numbers = a + b + c + d
        
        # Eve removes one number at a time
        for _ in range(total_numbers):
            if current_xor == 0:
                bob_wins += 1
            
            # Eve removes one number optimally
            if a > 0:
                a -= 1
                current_xor ^= 1
            elif b > 0:
                b -= 1
                current_xor ^= 2
            elif c > 0:
                c -= 1
                current_xor ^= 3
            elif d > 0:
                d -= 1
                current_xor ^= 4
        
        print(bob_wins)

func()
```

This corrected code correctly simulates the removal of numbers and calculates the XOR of the remaining numbers to determine if Bob wins. It also implements an optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.
