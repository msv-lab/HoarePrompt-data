You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether the sum of the elements in the specified range of the list is at least as large as the number of elements in that range that are greater than 1. It outputs 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the condition that the subarray must have an integer array `b` such that the sum of `a` and `b` are equal, and all elements of `b` are positive and different from the corresponding elements of `a`.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The program calculates a prefix sum array `a` and another prefix sum array `b` where each element is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1 or not.
2. For each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b` or if the subarray length is 1. If either condition is true, it prints "NO", otherwise it prints "YES".

The logic is flawed because it does not correctly ensure that the sum of the subarray in `a` can be matched by a corresponding subarray in `b` where all elements are positive and different from `a`.

Consider this counterexample:

Input:
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation of the Counterexample:
- The subarray is `[1, 1, 1]`.
- For this subarray, the sum is 3.
- To make a "good" array `b` such that `a[i] != b[i]` and `b[i] > 0`, we would need `b` to be something like `[2, 2, 2]` (sum = 6), `[2, 2, 3]` (sum = 7), etc., but none of these can match the sum of 3.
- The current program would incorrectly print "YES" because the sum of `a` (which is 3) is not less than the sum of `b` (which is 6), and the subarray length is not 1.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem description.
