The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether the sum of the elements in the specified range of the list is at least as large as the number of elements in that range that are greater than 1. It outputs 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise.
