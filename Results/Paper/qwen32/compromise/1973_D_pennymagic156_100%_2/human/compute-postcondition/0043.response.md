Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `1`, `i` is 2**

Natural Language: After executing the code, `cnt` is updated to the value of `k`, and `l` is set to `1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
