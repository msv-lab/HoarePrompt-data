The code snippet `n, k = func_3()` assigns the values returned by the function `func_3()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the function `func_3()` is not defined in the given context, we can only infer that `n` and `k` will take on whatever values `func_3()` returns. 

Given the initial state that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the hidden array, and `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, after executing the code snippet, `n` and `k` will be updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. However, without knowing the specifics of `func_3()`, we cannot determine the exact new values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the output state is that `n` and `k` are now the values returned by `func_3()`, and they still satisfy the condition that `n` is a positive integer and `1 <= k <= n`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, where `n` is a positive integer and `1 <= k <= n`.**
