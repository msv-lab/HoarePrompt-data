The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n` down to `1`, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it 3. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `v`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the given information.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `i` is 3, and if `v` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `v` remains the value returned by `func_2()`**.
