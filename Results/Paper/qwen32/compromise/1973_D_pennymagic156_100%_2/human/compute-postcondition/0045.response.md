To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is set to `k`.
- `l` is set to `1`.
- `i` is set to `2`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

#### Variable Values:
- `l` is explicitly given as `1`.
- `i` is explicitly given as `2`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`). Since the exact value of `v` is not provided, we'll represent it as `v`.

#### Expression Evaluation:
- `i * v` translates to `2 * v`.

### Constructing the Output:
Given the above, the print statement will output:
- `?` (a literal question mark),
- followed by the value of `l` which is `1`,
- followed by the value of `i * v` which is `2 * v`.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **? 1 2*v (where v is the value returned by func_2() during the last iteration with i=1)**
