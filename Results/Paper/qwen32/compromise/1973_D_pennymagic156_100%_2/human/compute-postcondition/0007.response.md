Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `n`, `k`, and `v` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without altering the values of these variables.
