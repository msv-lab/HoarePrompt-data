To determine the output state, we need to consider the effects of calling `func_2()` without knowing its implementation details. However, we know from the initial state that `v` holds the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration when `i = 1`.

Given the call to `func_2()`, we can infer that `v` will now hold the new value returned by `func_2()` during this current execution. Since no other variables are mentioned as being modified by `func_2()`, we assume only `v` changes.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the current iteration, `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `n + 1`.**
