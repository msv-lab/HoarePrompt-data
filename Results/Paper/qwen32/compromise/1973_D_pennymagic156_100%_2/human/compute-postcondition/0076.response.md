To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates. The loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than or equal to `n`. Given that `cnt` starts at `k` and decrements by 1 in each iteration, the loop will run exactly `k` times unless `l` exceeds `n` before `cnt` reaches 0.

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that `func_2()` returns a value that keeps `l` within the bounds of `1` to `n` for the first three iterations. Since the loop runs exactly `k` times, we can deduce that `k` iterations will exhaust `cnt` to 0, and the loop will terminate.

Here's the final state after `k` iterations:
- `cnt` will be `0` because it starts at `k` and decrements by 1 in each of the `k` iterations.
- `l` will be `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration, but we don't know its exact value without more information about `func_2()`. However, we know it will be some value that does not exceed `n` after `k` iterations.
- `i` remains `3` throughout the loop, so it will still be `3` after the loop finishes.
- `n`, `k`, and `v` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, `k` is an integer such that `k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration, `i` is `3`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `cnt` will be `0`, `l` will be the result of `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration, and all other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `i`) will remain as they were initially, with `i` specifically remaining `3`.
