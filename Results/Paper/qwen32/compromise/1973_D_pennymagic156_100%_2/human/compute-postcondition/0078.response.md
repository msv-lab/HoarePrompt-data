To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`.
- `k` is an integer such that `k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is `0`.
- `l` is `n + 1` from the last iteration.
- `i` is `3`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses an f-string to format the output.
- Inside the f-string, it calculates `i * v` and prefixes it with an exclamation mark (`!`).

#### Variable Values:
- `i` is explicitly given as `3`.
- `v` is described as the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`). However, the exact value of `v` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its numeric value precisely.

### Output Description:
Given the above information, the output will be `!` followed by the product of `i` and `v`. Since `i` is `3`, the output will be `! 3 * v`, where `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).

### Final Output:
Output: **! 3 * v (where v is the value returned by func_2() during the last iteration (i = 1))**
