To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is `0`.
- `l` is `n + 1`.
- `i` is `2`.

The condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` holds true, but this condition does not directly affect the print statement itself. It only provides context about the state of the program.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Here, we need to determine the value of `i * v`:
- `i` is explicitly given as `2`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`). Since the exact value of `v` is not specified, we cannot determine a numerical value for it, but we know it is the result of `func_2()` when `i = 1`.

Thus, the expression `i * v` evaluates to `2 * v`.

Given the information, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **! 2 * v (where v is the value returned by func_2() during the last iteration when i = 1)**
