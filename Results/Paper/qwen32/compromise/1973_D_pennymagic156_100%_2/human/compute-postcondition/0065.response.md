To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

1. **Variables and their states:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`.
   - `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
   - `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
   - `cnt` is set to `k`.
   - `l` is set to `1`.
   - `i` is set to `3`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`
   - This statement constructs a formatted string with the following components:
     - `?` is a literal character.
     - `{l}` is replaced by the value of `l`.
     - `{i * v}` is replaced by the result of multiplying `i` by `v`.

3. **Values of Variables:**
   - From the initial state, we know:
     - `l` is explicitly set to `1`.
     - `i` is explicitly set to `3`.
     - `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`). Since the exact value of `v` is not specified, we will represent it as `v`.

4. **Constructing the Output:**
   - Substituting the known values into the print statement:
     - `?` remains `?`.
     - `{l}` becomes `1`.
     - `{i * v}` becomes `3 * v`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 1 3*v (where v is the value returned by func_2() during the last iteration (i=1))**
