Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`.
- `i` is 4.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses an f-string to format the output.
- Inside the f-string, there is a placeholder `{i * n}`.
- We know the value of `i` is 4.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not provided.

### Calculation:
- The expression `i * n` will be evaluated as `4 * n`.

### Output:
Given that `n` is a positive integer, the output will be a string starting with `? 1` followed by the product of `i` and `n`.

Output: **? 1 4n (where n is a positive integer)**
