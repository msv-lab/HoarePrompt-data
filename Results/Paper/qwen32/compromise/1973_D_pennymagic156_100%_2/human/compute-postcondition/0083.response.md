The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a specific string along with a flush operation. Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is `0`.
- `l` is `n + 1`.
- `i` is `n // k`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('! -1', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `n`, `k`, `v`, `cnt`, `l`, or `i`. It simply prints the string `'! -1'` followed by a flush operation to ensure the output is immediately written to the standard output.

### Output:
The output of the print statement is the string `'! -1'`.

Output: **! -1**
