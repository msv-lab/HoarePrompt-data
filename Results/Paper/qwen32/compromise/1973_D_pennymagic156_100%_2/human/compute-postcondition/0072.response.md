To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `l`.

Given the loop condition:
```
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

- `cnt` must be non-zero (truthy) for the loop to continue.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to continue.

From the provided state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`.
- `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is `k - 2`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- `i` is `3`.

### Analysis:

1. **Condition on `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`. For `cnt` to be non-zero, `k - 2 > 0` which means `k > 2`. Since `k` is already given as `2 <= k <= n`, `k` must be at least `3` for `cnt` to be non-zero.

2. **Condition on `l`:**
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. For `l < n + 1` to hold, `func_2() + 1 < n + 1` which simplifies to `func_2() < n`. Since `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration, we need `v < n`.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `cnt` must be non-zero, which implies `k` should be at least `3`.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`, which implies `v` (the value returned by `func_2()`) must be less than `n`.

Since `k` is already given to be within the range `2 <= k <= n`, we need to ensure `k >= 3` for `cnt` to be non-zero. Additionally, `v` must be less than `n` for `l` to satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, `k` is an integer such that `3 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`) and `v < n`, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is `3`**
