The code snippet `cnt -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `cnt` is `k - 1`, after the decrement, `cnt` will be `k - 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is `3`.**
