Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy required to solve the problem. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `v`**: The program attempts to find the maximum possible value of `a_i` by querying `f(1, i * n)` for decreasing values of `i`. This approach is flawed because `f(1, i * n)` does not necessarily give information about the maximum value in the array. Instead, it gives the maximum value of `f(1, r)` for `r` up to `i * n`.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum Value**: A more appropriate strategy would involve using binary search to find the maximum value in the array. This can be done by querying `f(1, n)` with increasing values until the maximum value is found.

3. **Checking Valid Splits**: Once the maximum value is determined, the program should check if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray has the same `f(l, r)` value. The current implementation does not correctly handle this step.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `k = 1` or when the array cannot be split into `k` subarrays with the same `f(l, r)` value.

To fix these issues, the program should:

- Use binary search to find the maximum value in the array.
- Check if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with the same `f(l, r)` value using the maximum value found.
- Handle edge cases appropriately.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def query(l, x):
    print(f'? {l} {x}', flush=True)
    return int(input())

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Binary search for the maximum value in the array
        low, high = 1, n
        max_value = 1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            r = query(1, mid * n)
            if r == n:
                max_value = mid
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        
        # Check if we can split the array into k subarrays with the same f(l, r) value
        target = max_value * n
        cnt = 0
        l = 1
        while cnt < k and l <= n:
            r = query(l, target)
            if r == n + 1:
                break
            cnt += 1
            l = r + 1
        
        if cnt == k and l > n:
            print(f'! {target}', flush=True)
        else:
            print(f'! -1', flush=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version uses binary search to find the maximum value in the array and then checks if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with the same `f(l, r)` value.
