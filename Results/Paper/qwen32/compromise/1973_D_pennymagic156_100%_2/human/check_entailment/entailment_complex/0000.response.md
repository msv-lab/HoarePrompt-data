### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

#### Overview of the Code:
- The code reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- It then attempts to determine the largest `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray satisfies `f(l, r) = m`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Initialization and First Loop:**
   ```python
   v = 1
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
       v = func_2()
       if v == n:
           v = i
           break
   ```
   - This loop tries to find the largest possible value `v` such that `f(1, r) = i * n` for some `r`.
   - It starts from `i = n` and decreases `i` until it finds a valid `r` (i.e., `v != n + 1`).
   - If `v == n`, it sets `v = i` and breaks out of the loop. This implies that `i * n` is the largest possible value of `f(1, r)` for some `r`.

2. **Second Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
       cnt, l = k, 1
       while cnt and l < n + 1:
           print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
           l = func_2() + 1
           cnt -= 1
       if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1:
           print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
           func_2()
           return
   ```
   - This loop checks if the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray has `f(l, r) = i * v`.
   - It iterates from `i = 1` to `n // k` and tries to find `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = i * v`.
   - If it successfully finds `k` such subarrays (i.e., `cnt == 0` and `l == n + 1`), it prints `! i * v` and exits.

3. **Final Output:**
   ```python
   print('! -1', flush=True)
   func_2()
   return
   ```
   - If the above loops do not find a valid `m`, it prints `! -1`.

#### Issues:
- The first loop is intended to find the largest possible `v` such that `f(1, r) = i * n` for some `r`. However, it does not guarantee that `i * n` is achievable for any `r` in the array. It simply finds the largest `i` such that `v != n + 1`, which might not correspond to a valid `f(1, r)`.
- The second loop assumes that `i * v` is a valid candidate for `m`. However, the first loop does not ensure that `i * v` is achievable for any subarray.
- The logic for determining `m` is flawed because it does not correctly verify that `i * v` can be achieved for the required number of subarrays.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
