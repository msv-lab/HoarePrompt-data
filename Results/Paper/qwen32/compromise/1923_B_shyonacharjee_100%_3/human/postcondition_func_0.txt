The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters given their health and positions, and a limit on the number of bullets that can be used per unit distance. It prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated within the limit, otherwise 'NO'.
