Given the initial state, we know that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}, and `n` is equal to `k` for the current test case. The `print` statement is `print(n)`, which means we need to determine the value of `n` to know what will be printed.

Since `n` is explicitly stated to be equal to `k` and no specific values for `n` or `k` are provided other than their range and equality, the output will simply be the value of `n` (which is the same as `k`).

However, since the exact numerical value of `n` (or `k`) is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `n` (or `k`).

Output: **n (where n is equal to k)**
