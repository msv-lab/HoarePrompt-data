Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by handling three distinct cases for each test case:

1. **Case 1: \( n < k \)**
   - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she wants to buy, it is impossible for her to buy \( k \) jewels. The code correctly prints "NO" in this case.

2. **Case 2: \( n = k \)**
   - If Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels she wants to buy, Bob can set up one stall with the price per jewel equal to \( n \). Alice will buy exactly one jewel, and the code correctly prints "YES", followed by 1 and \( n \).

3. **Case 3: \( n > k \)**
   - If Alice has more coins than the number of jewels she wants to buy, the code checks if \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \). This condition is not directly related to the problem's requirement to buy exactly \( k \) jewels. Instead, it seems like an arbitrary condition used by the code to decide whether to print "YES" or "NO" for this case. However, the provided logic does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly \( k \) jewels in all scenarios where \( n > k \).

   - For example, if \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 3 \), the code prints "YES" followed by 2, 5, and 1. This means Alice would buy 1 jewel from the first stall (costing 5 coins) and 2 jewels from the second stall (costing 1 coin each), totaling 4 jewels. This does not meet the requirement of buying exactly 3 jewels.

   - Another example, if \( n = 255 \) and \( k = 8 \), the code prints "YES" followed by 8, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1. This means Alice would buy 1 jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels, which meets the requirement.

To ensure the correctness of the solution, the code needs to be modified to guarantee that Alice will always buy exactly \( k \) jewels for all valid inputs where \( n \ge k \). The current logic does not achieve this for all cases.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
