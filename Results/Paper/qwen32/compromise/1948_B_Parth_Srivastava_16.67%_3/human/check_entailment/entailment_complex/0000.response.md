### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to determine if it's possible to sort an array of integers by decomposing integers greater than 10 into their constituent digits and rearranging them if necessary. The program reads multiple test cases, processes each test case using the `func_1` function, and then prints "YES" or "NO" based on whether the processed array is sorted.

However, there are several issues with the `func_1` function that make the program incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Decomposition Logic**: The function checks if the tens digit (`y`) is less than or equal to the units digit (`x`) before appending the digits to the list `c`. This logic is flawed because it does not ensure that the entire array can be sorted. For example, if the array is `[28, 5]`, the function will decompose `28` into `2` and `8` because `2 <= 8`, but it will not consider the possibility of rearranging other elements to achieve a sorted array.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Decomposition**: Even if the digits are decomposed correctly, the function does not handle the decomposition in a way that allows for the entire array to be sorted. It simply checks if the current state of the array is sorted after processing each element, which is not sufficient.

3. **Inadequate Sorting Check**: The function checks if the list `c` is sorted after processing each element. This check is too simplistic and does not account for the possibility of rearranging elements across the entire array.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program is incorrect. The logic for decomposing the numbers and checking if the array can be sorted is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
