Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes an array of integers. The function `func_1` is responsible for processing each array and deciding if it can be sorted by the described operation.

#### Function `func_1` Breakdown
1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of elements `k` and the list of integers `a`.
2. **Processing Elements**:
   - For each element in the array, if the element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its tens and units digits.
   - It then attempts to insert these digits into a new list `c` with some conditions.
3. **Sorting Check**: After processing all elements, it checks if the list `c` is sorted and appends `1` to `b` if it is sorted, otherwise appends `0`.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting Logic**: The program does not correctly handle the insertion of split digits back into the array. The conditions used for insertion are not sufficient to ensure the array remains sorted.
2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic**: The logic for comparing and inserting split digits is flawed. Conditions like `if y >= c[n - 1]` and `if y <= x` are not sufficient to ensure the array remains sorted after insertion.
3. **Lack of Proper Sorting Check**: The program checks if the final array `c` is sorted by comparing it with `sorted(c)`, but the array `c` is constructed incorrectly due to the issues mentioned above.

### Test Case Analysis
Let's consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
```
1
4
12 28 5
```
- **Expected Output**: `YES`
- **Explanation**: Split `12` into `[1, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 28, 5]`. Split `28` into `[2, 8]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`. The array can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`, which is sorted.

The provided program will not handle this case correctly due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if an array can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

**Final: False**
