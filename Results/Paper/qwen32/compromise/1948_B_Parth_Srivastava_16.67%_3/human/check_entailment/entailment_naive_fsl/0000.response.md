Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if an array can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits. Let's break down some issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting Logic**: The program attempts to split numbers greater than 10, but it doesn't correctly handle the insertion of these digits back into the array. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should split `12` into `[1, 2]`, but it does not correctly insert these digits into the array while maintaining the order.

2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic**: The code uses incorrect logic to compare and insert split digits. Specifically, the conditions `if y >= c[n - 1]` and `if y <= x` are not sufficient to ensure the array remains sorted after insertion of split digits.

3. **Lack of Proper Sorting Check**: The program checks if the final array `c` is sorted by comparing it with `sorted(c)`. However, the array `c` is constructed incorrectly due to the issues mentioned above, so this check is not meaningful.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4
12 28 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
- Split `12` into `[1, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
- Split `28` into `[2, 8]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.
- The array can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`, which is sorted.

However, the provided code will not correctly handle this case due to the issues in the logic for splitting and inserting digits.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
