Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of integers; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0.**
The variable `x` is assigned the value 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `k`) retain their initial values.
