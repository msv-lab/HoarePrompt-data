Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 0 <= a_i <= 99. The function processes each test case and returns a specific value based on the input list `a`.**
