The code provided is `b.append(0)`, which appends the integer `0` to the list `b`. However, the initial state does not mention a list `b`. Assuming `b` is not defined, there would be an error. Since the task specifies to provide the output state based on the given initial state and the code snippet, and there is no `b` in the initial state, we'll consider the task as if `b` were an empty list by default for the purpose of this exercise.

Output State: **`n` is 9; `a` is [12, 34, 5, 67, 89]; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 9; `y` is 8; `c` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; `d` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; `c` is not equal to `d`; `b` is [0]**
