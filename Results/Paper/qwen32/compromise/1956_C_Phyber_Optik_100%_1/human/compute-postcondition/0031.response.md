The code snippet `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to it. Given that `i` is 5, we can calculate the expression as follows:

1. Calculate `i * i`: This is `5 * 5 = 25`.
2. Calculate `(i - 1) * (i - 1)`: This is `4 * 4 = 16`.
3. Calculate `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)`: This is `25 - 16 = 9`.
4. Finally, multiply the result by `i`: `9 * 5 = 45`.

So, `sum` is updated by adding 45 to its current value. Since the initial state specifies that `sum` is updated by adding 28 to it, we can denote the initial value of `sum` as `sum_initial + 28`. After executing the code, `sum` becomes `sum_initial + 28 + 45 = sum_initial + 73`.

The values of `n`, `j`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum` is updated by adding 73 to its initial value, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 6, `t` is 1, `i` is 5**.
