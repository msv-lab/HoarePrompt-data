The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 (since the previous value of `i` was 2, and it would have been incremented by 1), `n` is at least 2, `j` is 6, and `t` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `n` must be at least 4 (since `i` must be less than `n + 1`).

State: **`sum` is updated by adding `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to it, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 6, `t` is 1, `i` is 4**
