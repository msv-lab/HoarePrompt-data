The loop head in the provided code snippet is `for _ in range(t):`. This means that the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1 since the loop will not run if `t` is 0. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not used within the loop.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1**.
