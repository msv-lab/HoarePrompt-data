Given the initial state, we know that `sum` is the result of a series computation for `n = 5`, and the final `sum` is 102. Additionally, `n` is explicitly given as 5.

Let's break down the print statement:
- `sum` is the result of the series computation, which is 102.
- `n + n` simply adds `n` to itself. Since `n` is 5, `n + n` evaluates to 10.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `sum` followed by the result of `n + n`.

Output: **102, 10**
