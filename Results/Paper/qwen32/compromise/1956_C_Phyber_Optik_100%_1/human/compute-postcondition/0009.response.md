The given code snippet modifies the value of `sum` based on the current values of `i` and `n`. The value of `n` and `t` are not affected by the code snippet provided. The calculation inside the code can be broken down as follows:

- `i * i` calculates the square of `i`, which is `5 * 5 = 25`.
- `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` calculates the square of `i - 1`, which is `4 * 4 = 16`.
- The difference between these two squares is `25 - 16 = 9`.
- This difference is then multiplied by `i`, which is `9 * 5 = 45`.
- This result is added to the current value of `sum`, which is `57 + 45 = 102`.

Thus, the value of `sum` is updated to `102`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer that must be at least 2; `sum` is 102; `i` is 5**.
