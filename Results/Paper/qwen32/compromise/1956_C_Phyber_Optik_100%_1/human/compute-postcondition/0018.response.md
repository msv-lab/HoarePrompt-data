Let's break down the provided code snippet and the initial state to understand the output.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 5.
- `j` is 4.
- `sum` is the result of some series computation for the given `n`, but it is not used in the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Argument (`2`)**:
   - The first argument is a literal integer `2`.
   
2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - `n` is 5.
   - `j` is 4.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` evaluates to `5 - 4 + 1`, which is `2`.
   
3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - Since `n` is 5, `range(1, 6)` generates the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range and passes each element as a separate argument to the `print` function.

### Final Output:
Combining all parts:
- The first argument is `2`.
- The second argument is `2`.
- The third argument is the unpacked range `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output these values separated by spaces.

Output: **2 2 1 2 3 4 5**
