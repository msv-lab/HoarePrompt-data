To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the variables and their values based on the provided initial state. Let's break down the code snippet:

```
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is 5.
- `sum` is the result of a series computation for the given `n`. However, `sum` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `j` is not defined in the initial state, which means it is not provided and could be any value. However, since `j` is used in the expression `n - j + 1`, we need to assume `j` is defined in the context where this code runs. Since `j` is not given, we must assume it is a variable that has a specific value in the actual code context. For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume `j` is a variable that has a known value. Since `j` is not specified, we will assume it to be 0 for the sake of this explanation, as it's a common default value in such scenarios.

Let's substitute the values and evaluate the expression step-by-step:

1. `1` is a constant and will print as `1`.
2. `n - j + 1`:
   - Given `n` is 5 and assuming `j` is 0, the expression becomes `5 - 0 + 1`, which equals `6`.
3. `*range(1, n + 1)`:
   - This will unpack the range from 1 to `n + 1` (i.e., 1 to 6).
   - The range `range(1, 6)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Combining these results, the print statement will output:
```
1 6 1 2 3 4 5
```

Output: **1 6 1 2 3 4 5**
