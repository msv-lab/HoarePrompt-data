Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using type 1 and type 2 operations.
- Each operation allows us to fill a row or column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
- The goal is to maximize the sum using no more than `2n` operations.

### Key Observations:
- To maximize the sum, we need to place the largest possible numbers in the matrix.
- The optimal strategy involves filling the matrix such that each number from 1 to `n` appears as many times as possible, and the placement maximizes the sum.

### Solution Analysis:
- The provided solution calculates the sum of the matrix using the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
- The number of operations is set to `2n`.
- The operations involve filling the matrix with the numbers 1 to `n` in a specific order, alternating between rows and columns.

### Verification:
- Let's verify the sum calculation:
  - For `n = 1`, the sum is 1.
  - For `n = 2`, the sum is \(\frac{2(2 + 1)(4 \cdot 2 - 1)}{6} = \frac{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7}{6} = 7\).
  - For `n = 3`, the sum is \(\frac{3(3 + 1)(4 \cdot 3 - 1)}{6} = \frac{3 \cdot 4 \cdot 11}{6} = 22\).

- The operations provided by the program are:
  - For each `j` from 1 to `n`, perform a type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` with permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
  - Then perform a type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1` with permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Detailed Reasoning:
- The operations described in the program do not guarantee that the matrix will be filled optimally to maximize the sum.
- The program fills each row and column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.
- To maximize the sum, we should aim to place the largest numbers in the matrix in a way that each number from 1 to `n` appears as many times as possible, and we should consider a more strategic placement.

### Example:
For `n = 2`:
- The optimal solution would be to fill the matrix as follows:
  - Row 1: `[2, 1]`
  - Row 2: `[1, 2]`
- This gives a sum of \(2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6\), which is incorrect according to the problem's optimal sum of 7.
- The provided program's operations would fill the matrix as:
  - Row 2: `[1, 2]`
  - Column 2: `[1, 2]`
  - Row 1: `[1, 2]`
  - Column 1: `[1, 2]`
- This results in the matrix:
  - Row 1: `[1, 2]`
  - Row 2: `[1, 2]`
- This gives a sum of \(1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6\), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix. The operations described do not ensure an optimal placement of the numbers to achieve the maximum sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
