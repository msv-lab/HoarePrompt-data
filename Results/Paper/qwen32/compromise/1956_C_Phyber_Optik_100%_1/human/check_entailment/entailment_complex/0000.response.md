### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using at most `2n` operations. The operations allow us to set the elements of a row or a column to a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. The maximum sum is achieved by using the largest possible numbers in the matrix, which can be done by filling the matrix with permutations of `1` to `n` in a strategic manner.

The given program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and outputs the operations needed to achieve this sum. Let's analyze the key parts of the program:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   The sum is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}
   \]
   This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` squares multiplied by `n` (since each row/column can be filled with a permutation of `1` to `n`).

2. **Operations:**
   The program outputs `2n` operations to fill the matrix. Specifically, it performs `n` type 1 operations and `n` type 2 operations:
   - For each row `i` from `1` to `n`, it performs a type 1 operation setting the row to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - For each column `i` from `1` to `n`, it performs a type 2 operation setting the column to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

   However, the specific operations performed in the code are:
   - For each `j` from `1` to `n`, it performs a type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` and a type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1`, both setting the row/column to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

   This strategy ensures that each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, thus maximizing the sum of the matrix.

3. **Output:**
   The program outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the detailed operations themselves.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs the operations needed to achieve this sum. The operations ensure that each row and column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which is the optimal way to maximize the sum of the matrix. Therefore, the program is correct.
