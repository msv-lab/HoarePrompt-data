The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an array `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints pairs of numbers from the first half of `a` that appear exactly twice, additional numbers from the first half that appear exactly once (up to `2k` total numbers), numbers stored in `res`, and pairs from the second half that appear exactly twice until the count of printed numbers from the first and second halves are equal.
