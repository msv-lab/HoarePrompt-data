You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an array `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints pairs of numbers from the first half of `a` that appear exactly twice, additional numbers from the first half that appear exactly once (up to `2k` total numbers), numbers stored in `res`, and pairs from the second half that appear exactly twice until the count of printed numbers from the first and second halves are equal.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an array `a` of length `2n` where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice.
- We need to find two arrays `l` and `r` each of length `2k` such that:
    - `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
    - `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
    - The bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - Two arrays `l` and `r` of size `n` are initialized to zero. These arrays will be used to count occurrences of each number in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
   - The program then counts the occurrences of each number in the first `n` elements and the last `n` elements of `a`.

3. **Constructing `l` and `r`:**
   - The program tries to construct the array `l` by first including pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice in the first half of `a`. It prints these pairs and increments `ul` (the length of `l`).
   - If `ul` reaches `2k`, it stops adding elements to `l`.
   - If `ul` is less than `2k`, it then adds individual numbers that appear exactly once in the first half of `a` to `l` until it reaches `2k`.
   - The program then prints the elements of `l`.

4. **Constructing `r`:**
   - The program starts constructing `r` by including pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice in the second half of `a` and prints these pairs. It increments `ur` (the length of `r`).
   - If `ur` equals `ul`, it stops adding elements to `r`.
   - If `ul` is not equal to `ur` (which is a mistake in the logic), it continues to add pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice in the second half of `a` until `ur` equals `ul`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`.
- The program does not handle the case where `ul` and `ur` might not be equal after the construction of `l` and `r`.
- The logic for constructing `r` is flawed, as it does not guarantee that the XOR condition is met.

### Correctness:
The program does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` will be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
