You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ul`, `ur`, `re`, and `res` reflect the state after processing all test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the requirements of the problem description in all cases. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in the two arrays `l` and `r` are equal. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Initialization and Counting Elements:**
   - The program initializes two lists `l` and `r` of length `n` with zeros. These lists are meant to count the occurrences of each number in the first and second halves of the array `a`, respectively.
   - It then iterates over the first half and second half of `a` to populate `l` and `r`.

2. **Constructing Arrays `l` and `r`:**
   - The program first tries to add pairs of identical numbers from the first half of `a` to the output list for `l` until it reaches `2k` elements.
   - If there are not enough pairs in the first half to reach `2k` elements, it adds single elements from the first half to the output list for `l` until it reaches `2k` elements.
   - The program then attempts to construct `r` by adding pairs of identical numbers from the second half of `a` until the number of elements in `r` matches the number of elements in `l`.

3. **Ensuring Equal XOR:**
   - The critical part of the problem is ensuring that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`. The provided program does not explicitly check or ensure this condition.
   - The program simply tries to match the number of elements in `l` and `r` without considering the XOR values.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```
The program might output:
```
1 2 1 2
1 2 1 2
```
In this case, the XOR of `l` and `r` is indeed the same (since both are `1 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 2`), but the program does not guarantee this for all cases. For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1
```
The program might output:
```
1 2 1 2
4 3 4 3
```
Here, the XOR of `l` is `1 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 2 = 0`, but the XOR of `r` is `4 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 3 = 0`, which is correct in this case. However, the program does not ensure this for all possible inputs and could produce incorrect results for other inputs.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve constructing the arrays `l` and `r` while ensuring that their XOR values are equal. This can be done by carefully selecting elements from the first and second halves of the array `a` to ensure the XOR condition is met.

Since the program does not guarantee the correct XOR values for all cases, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
