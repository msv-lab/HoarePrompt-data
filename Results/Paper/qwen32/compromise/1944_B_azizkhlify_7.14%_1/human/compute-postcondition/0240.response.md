In the given initial state, we are told that `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2. However, there is no information provided about the list or variable `a`. Since `a[i]` is referenced in the print statement, we need to assume that `a` is some list or array that has at least 3 elements (because `i` is 2, and list indices start at 0).

Given that the exact elements of `a` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `a`. Specifically, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`, which is the third element of the list `a`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

This means it will print the value of `a[2]` twice, separated by a space, and it will not add a newline at the end (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list a)**
