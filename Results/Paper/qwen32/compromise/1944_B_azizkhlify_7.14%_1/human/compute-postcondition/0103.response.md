The provided code snippet only reads input values and assigns them to `n` and `k`. It does not modify `t`, `ul`, or `ur` in any way. Therefore, the state of `t`, `ul`, and `ur` remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` will be the integers provided as input.

Output State: **`t`, `ul`, and `ur` are variables; `n` is the first input integer; `k` is the second input integer.**
