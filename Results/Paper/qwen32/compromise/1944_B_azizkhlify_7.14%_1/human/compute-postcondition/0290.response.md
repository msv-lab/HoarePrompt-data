Postcondition: **`n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `res` contains up to `k` elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero, `i` is `n`, `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true, multiplied by 2, `a` remains the same, `l` reflects the counts of each element in `a`, `r` remains the same, `re` is equal to `k` if `k` is non-zero. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no else part to execute.**
