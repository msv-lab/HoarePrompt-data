Output State: **`t` is defined, `ul` is defined, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n + 2`, `ur` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `t`, `ul`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `ur` remains unchanged as well because no operation modifies it before the `break` statement is encountered.
