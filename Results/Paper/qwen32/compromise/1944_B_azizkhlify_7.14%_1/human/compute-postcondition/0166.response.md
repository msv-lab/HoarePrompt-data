Postcondition: ***`t` is a variable, `ul` is either `k * 2` or `k * 2 + 2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of a)`, `ur` is 0, `n` is 2, `k` is either `-2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of a)` (and not 0), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`, `r` is `[0, 1]`, `i` is 2. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, then `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` contains the element `a[2]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged from the precondition.***
