To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variable `i`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive).
   - `n`: An integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a`: A list of integers.
   - `l`: A list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer \(i+1\) in the list `a`.
   - `r`: A list of `n` integers.
   - `ul`: The sum of 2 for each element in `a` that appears exactly twice in the list `l` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations.
   - `ur`: Initialized to 0.
   - `res`: A list containing at least one element.
   - `i`: The next element in `res` after the current `i`.
   - `k`: If `k` is not zero, `re` is the number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1 up to the point where the loop breaks or completes.

2. **Key Points:**
   - `i` is described as "the next element in `res` after the current `i`". This suggests that `i` is an element of the list `res` and is being iterated over or processed in some way.
   - The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is directly related to the list `res`. Since `res` is stated to contain at least one element, `i` will be one of the elements of `res`.
- The exact value of `i` cannot be determined without knowing the specific contents of `res`. However, we can describe `i` as an element of `res`.

### Output:
The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the current value of `i` followed by a space. Since `i` is an element of the list `res`, the output will be the value of `i` from the list `res`.

Output: **i (where i is an element of the list `res`)**
