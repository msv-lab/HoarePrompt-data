Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that n >= 1, `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is 0, `ul` is the sum of 2 for each element in `a` that appears exactly twice in the list `l` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations, `ur` is 0, and `res` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that n >= 1, `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `ul` is the sum of 2 for each element in `a` that appears exactly twice in the list `l` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list unless `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, in which case `res` contains the element `a[0]`, `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` remains 0, `i` is 0. If `re` equals `k`, the program has executed the if part; otherwise, the program has skipped the if part as there is no else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that n >= 1, `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `ul` is the sum of 2 for each element in `a` that appears exactly twice in the list `l` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing `a[1]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, otherwise `res` is empty, `re` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, otherwise `re` is 1, `i` is 1. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that n >= 1, `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `ul` is the sum of 2 for each element in `a` that appears exactly twice in the list `l` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing `a[1]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, and `a[2]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1 for the current `i`, `re` is 3 if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, otherwise `re` is 2, and `i` is 2. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
