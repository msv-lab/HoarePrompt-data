To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `ul` is 0
   - `ur` is 0
   - `n` is 2
   - `k` is the second input integer (not explicitly known, but it's irrelevant for this print statement)
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input (not explicitly known, but we can infer some information about it)
   - `l` is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`.
   - `r` is [0, 1]
   - `re` is 0
   - `res` is an empty list

2. **Specific Information about `l` and `a`:**
   - The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, indicating that the integer `a[i]` appears exactly twice in the list `a`.

### Analysis:
- Since `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it means that the integer `a[i]` appears exactly twice in the list `a`.
- The list `l` has 2 elements, which implies that the integers in `a` can only be 1 or 2 (because `l[0]` counts occurrences of 1 and `l[1]` counts occurrences of 2).

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```
This statement prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and does not add a newline at the end.

### Determining the Value of `a[i]`:
- Since `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `a[i]` must be either 1 or 2, and it appears exactly twice in the list `a`.
- Without loss of generality, let's assume `a[i]` is 1 (it could also be 2, but the output format will be the same regardless of the specific value as long as it appears twice).

### Output:
Given that `a[i]` appears exactly twice in the list `a`, the print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **1 1** (assuming `a[i]` is 1, it could also be **2 2** if `a[i]` is 2, but the format is the same)
