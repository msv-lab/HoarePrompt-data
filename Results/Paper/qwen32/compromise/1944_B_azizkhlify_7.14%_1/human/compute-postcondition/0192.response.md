Postcondition: **`res` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `res` plus 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `ul` is equal to `ur` if `ul` was originally equal to `ur`. Otherwise, `ul` is not equal to `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ul` is not equal to the new value of `ur` (which is `ur + 2`). If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ur` is now `ur + 2`. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.**
