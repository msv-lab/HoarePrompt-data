Postcondition: **The loop prints all elements in `res` separated by spaces, and `i` is the last element of `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `i` is `2*n - 1` unless the loop breaks due to `ul` equaling `ur`. During the iterations, `ur` is incremented by 2 for every iteration where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, and `ul` remains unchanged unless it equals `ur`.**
