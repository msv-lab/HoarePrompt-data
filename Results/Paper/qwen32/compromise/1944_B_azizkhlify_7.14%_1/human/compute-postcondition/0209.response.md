The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `res` is a list (unchanged), `i` is the last element of `res` (unchanged), `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0**.
