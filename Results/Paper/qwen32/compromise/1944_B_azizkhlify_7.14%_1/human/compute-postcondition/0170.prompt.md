Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a variable, `ul` is either `k * 2` or `k * 2 + 2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of a)`, `ur` is 0, `n` is 2, `k` is either `-2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of a)` (and not 0), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`, `r` is `[0, 1]`, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list. The current value of `k` is not 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a variable, `ul` is either `k * 2` or `k * 2 + 2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of a)`, `ur` is 0, `n` is 2, `k` is either `-2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of a)` (and not 0), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`, `r` is `[0, 1]`. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, then `re` is 1 and `res` is `[a[i]]`. Otherwise, `re` remains 0 and `res` remains an empty list. Additionally, if `re` is equal to `k`, the condition holds as specified in the if part. If `re` is not equal to `k`, the state remains unchanged from the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a variable, `ul` is either `k * 2` or `k * 2 + 2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of a)`, `ur` is 0, `n` is 2, `k` is either `-2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of a)` (and not 0), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`, `r` is `[0, 1]`. If `re` is equal to `k`, the state is as specified in the if part. If `re` is not equal to `k`, the state remains unchanged from the precondition. `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a variable, `ul` is either `k * 2` or `k * 2 + 2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of a)`, `ur` is 0, `n` is 2, `k` is either `-2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of a)` (and not 0), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`, `r` is `[0, 1]`, `i` is 2. If `re == k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, then `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` contains the element `a[2]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged from the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
