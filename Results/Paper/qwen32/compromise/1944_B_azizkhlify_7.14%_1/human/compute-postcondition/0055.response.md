To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], end=' ')`, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 1\).
- `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero. However, this seems like a circular definition and needs clarification. For our purposes, we'll focus on other variables.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer \(i+1\) in the list `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers.
- `ul` is the sum of 2 for each element in `a` that appears exactly twice in the list `l` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations.
- `ur` is 0.
- `res` is an empty list unless `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, in which case `res` contains the element `a[0]`.
- `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` remains 0.
- `i` is 1.

### Analysis:
Given the initial state, we know that `i` is set to 1. Therefore, `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

### Output:
Since the exact elements of the list `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[1]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value at index 1 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the element at index 1 of the list `a`)**
