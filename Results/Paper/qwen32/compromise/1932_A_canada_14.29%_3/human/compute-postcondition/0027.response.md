Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the next character in `s`. If the next character `i` is '@', then `ret` is set to 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1, and if `thorn` was 2, it is now 3. If `i` is not '@', `ret` is set to 0. If `i` is not '*', `thorn` remains unchanged (either 0, 1, or 2).**
