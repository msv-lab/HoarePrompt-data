The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over the list `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next character in the list `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `len` is the input integer.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character.
- `i` is the next character in the list `s`.
- If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. Otherwise, `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is either 0 or 1, with `thorn` being set to 1 if `i` is '*', and 0 otherwise.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current character being processed. In the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the previous `i`.** 

Since the values of `ret` and `thorn` are determined by the current value of `i` and will be recalculated in the next iteration based on the new value of `i`, they do not need to be adjusted in the state description for the next iteration.
