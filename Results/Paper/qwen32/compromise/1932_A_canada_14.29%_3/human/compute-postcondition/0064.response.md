The provided code snippet `thorn == 0` is a comparison and does not assign a value to `thorn` or any other variable. Therefore, it does not change the state of any variables. The comparison `thorn == 0` evaluates to either `True` or `False` but does not store or use this result in any way based on the given code snippet.

Given this, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with the specific condition that `thorn == 0` is evaluated but not used.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2; `i` is the next character in the list `s`**
