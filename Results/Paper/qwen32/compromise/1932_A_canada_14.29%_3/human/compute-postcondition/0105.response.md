Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. Otherwise, `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is either 0 or 1, with `thorn` being set to 1 if `i` is '*', and 0 otherwise.**
