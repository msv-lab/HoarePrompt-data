Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2. If the current character `i` is '@', `ret` is 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `thorn` was 2, otherwise `thorn` is set to 1 and the program does not break out of the loop or if statement. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `ret` remains 0 and `thorn` remains 0.**
