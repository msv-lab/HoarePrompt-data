Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 0, and the current character `i` is '@'.**

The value of `ret` has been incremented by 1, so `ret` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
