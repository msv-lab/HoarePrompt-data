Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the next character in `s`; if the next character `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1; otherwise, `ret` is 0. If `i` is equal to '*', then `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` was 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not equal to '*', then `thorn` remains 0.

Code:
```
thorn += 1
```

Impact: The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is `thorn + 1` (which means if `thorn` was 0, it is now 1; if `thorn` was 1, it is now 2; if `thorn` was 2, it is now 3); if the next character `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1; otherwise, `ret` is 0. If `i` is equal to '*', then `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` was 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not equal to '*', then `thorn` remains 0.**
