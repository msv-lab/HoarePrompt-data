The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over the list `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `i` changes and what the implications are for the other variables.

Given the loop:
```
for i in s:
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `len` is an input integer.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character.
- `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the next character in `s`.
- `ret` is set based on the value of `i`.
- `i` is the current character being processed in the list `s`.

After the previous iteration, `i` has been processed, and the loop will attempt to move to the next character in the list `s`.

State Adjustments:
- `i` will now be the next character in the list `s`.
- `thorn` and `ret` will be updated based on the value of the new `i` (but these are not part of the loop head, so they don't need to be adjusted here).

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to adjust `i` to be the next character in the list `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the next character in `s`, `i` is the next character in the list `s`**
