Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is `thorn + 1`. If `thorn` was 2, then `thorn` is now 3, and if the next character `i` is '@', `ret` is set to 1; otherwise, `ret` is set to 0. Additionally, if `thorn` was 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `thorn` was not 2, `thorn` remains 2.**
