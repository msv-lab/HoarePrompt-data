### Reasoning:

The goal is to find a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, using at most \(3n\) queries. The provided program attempts to achieve this by leveraging the properties of bitwise operations and the interactivity of the problem.

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation \(n\).
   - It initializes `g` to 0 (though `g` is never used in the program) and `v1` to 0, which will be used to track the index with the maximum bitwise OR value.

2. **Finding the Index with Maximum Bitwise OR Value:**
   - The program iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - For each index \(i\), it performs a query comparing the bitwise OR of \(p_{v1}\) with itself (`v1 | v1`) to the bitwise OR of \(p_i\) with itself (`i | i`).
   - Since `v1 | v1` is always equal to `p_{v1}` and `i | i` is always equal to `p_i`, the query effectively compares `p_{v1}` and `p_i`.
   - If `p_i` is greater than `p_{v1}`, it updates `v1` to `i`. This ensures that `v1` ends up being the index with the maximum value in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Index that Maximizes XOR with `v1`:**
   - The program initializes `prev` to 0, which will be used to track the index that maximizes the XOR with `p_{v1}`.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - For each index \(i\), it performs a query comparing the bitwise OR of \(p_{v1}\) with \(p_i\) (`v1 | i`) to the bitwise OR of \(p_{v1}\) with `p_{prev}` (`v1 | prev`).
   - If `p_{v1} | p_i` is greater than `p_{v1} | p_{prev}`, it updates `prev` to `i`. This ensures that `prev` ends up being the index that maximizes the XOR with `p_{v1}`.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - After determining `prev` and `v1`, the program outputs `! prev v1`, which are the indices that maximize the XOR value.

### Analysis:

- **Query Count:** The program performs \(2(n-1)\) queries per test case, which is within the limit of \(3n\) queries.
- **Correctness of Logic:** The logic correctly identifies the index with the maximum value and then finds the index that maximizes the XOR with this maximum value. This approach leverages the properties of bitwise OR and XOR operations effectively.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is correct based on the problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
