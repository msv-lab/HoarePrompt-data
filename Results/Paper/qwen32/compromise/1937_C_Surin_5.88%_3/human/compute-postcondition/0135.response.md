The code snippet `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `prev` after the assignment. However, we know that `prev` will now hold whatever value `i` had before this line was executed.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i`, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string, and `r` equals `'>'`.**

In natural language: The value of `prev` is now the same as the value of `i`. All other variables retain their initial values.
