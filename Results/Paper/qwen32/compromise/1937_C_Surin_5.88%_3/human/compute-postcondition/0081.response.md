To determine the output of the given print statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `v2` is initialized to `n-1`.
- `prev` is initialized to 0.
- `kp` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, but it is not used in the print statement.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `v1`: This is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<'. If no such `i` exists, `v1` is 0.
- `i`: This variable is not defined in the initial state provided. It seems to be a loop variable or some other context-specific variable that is not mentioned. Since it's not defined, we cannot determine its exact value from the given information.
- `prev`: This is initialized to 0.

### Analysis:
- The print statement includes `v1`, `i`, `v1` again, and `prev`.
- We know `v1` is either the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `prev` is explicitly given as 0.
- `i` is undefined in the context provided, so we cannot determine its value precisely.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of definition for `i`, we can only describe its value as "undefined" or "unknown" based on the provided initial state.

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] 0 (where v1 is the highest index i where r was '<' or 0 if no such i exists, and i is undefined)**
