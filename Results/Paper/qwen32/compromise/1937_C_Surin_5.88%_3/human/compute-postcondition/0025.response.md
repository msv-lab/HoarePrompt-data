The code snippet provided reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is the assignment of the input value to `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i + 1`, `v1` is `i + 1` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is the input value**.
