The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer to ensure that all output is written to the console immediately. However, this function does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`, `r`, `i`) are modified by the `sys.stdout.flush()` call. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `kp` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, and `r` is either '>' or '<', `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
