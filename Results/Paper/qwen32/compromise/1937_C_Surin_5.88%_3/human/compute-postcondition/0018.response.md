The code snippet `r = input('')` assigns the value of user input to the variable `r`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `g`, `v2`, or `v1`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` is 0, `r` is the user input.**
