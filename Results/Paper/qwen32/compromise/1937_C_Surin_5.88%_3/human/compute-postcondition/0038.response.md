Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
2. `n` is greater than 1.
3. `g` is initialized to 0.
4. `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
5. `v2` is initialized to `n-1`.
6. `prev` is set to `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` remains 0.
7. `r` is an input string.
8. `i` is incremented by 1.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

#### Variables Involved:
- `v1`: This is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<'. If no such `i` exists, `v1` is 0.
- `i`: This is an integer that gets incremented by 1 in each iteration (though the exact value of `i` at this point isn't specified, it is known to have been incremented).
- `prev`: This is set to `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise it remains 0.

### Output Explanation:
- `v1` will be the highest index `i` where `r` was '<'. If no such index exists, `v1` will be 0.
- `i` is the current index after being incremented by 1.
- `prev` will be `i` if `r` was '>', otherwise it will be 0.

Given the lack of specific values for `i`, `r`, and the exact sequence of operations leading up to this print statement, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the highest value of i for which r was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, i is the current index after being incremented by 1, and prev is i if r was '>', otherwise 0)**
