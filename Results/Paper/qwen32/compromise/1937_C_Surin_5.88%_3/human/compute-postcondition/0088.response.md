To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Initial Values**:
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (not directly relevant to this print statement).
   - `n`: Greater than 1.
   - `g`: Set to 0.
   - `v1`: The highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `v2`: Set to `n-1`.
   - `prev`: Set to `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` remains unchanged.
   - `kp`: Incremented by 1 for each iteration (not directly relevant to this print statement).
   - `r`: Either '>' or '<'.
   - `i`: Incremented by 1 from its previous value.

2. **Print Statement Analysis**:
   - The print statement is: `print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`
   - This means it will print a formatted string starting with '?' followed by the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1` again, and `prev`.

3. **Determining the Values**:
   - `v1`: This is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<'. If no such `i` exists, `v1` is 0.
   - `i`: This is the current index, which is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `prev`: This is set to `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged.

Given the information, the exact values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev` depend on the specific iterations and conditions encountered during the execution of the loop. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables:

- The output will start with '?'.
- It will then print the value of `v1`, which is the highest index where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such index exists.
- Next, it will print the current value of `i`.
- It will print `v1` again.
- Finally, it will print the value of `prev`, which is `i` if `r` was '>' in the last iteration, otherwise it retains its previous value.

Therefore, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the highest index i where r was '<' or 0 if no such i exists, i is the current index, and prev is i if r was '>' in the last iteration, otherwise it retains its previous value)**
