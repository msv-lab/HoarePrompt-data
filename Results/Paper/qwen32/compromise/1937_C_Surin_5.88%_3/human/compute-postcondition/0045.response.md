The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the output stream. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `r`, or `i` are modified by this line of code.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before the `sys.stdout.flush()` call, the only change in the state is that `i` will now hold the value of its previous value plus one.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string, `i` is incremented by 1**.
