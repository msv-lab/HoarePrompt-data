The code snippet `v2 = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `v2`. Given the initial state, `v2` was previously set to `n-1`. After the assignment, `v2` now holds the value of `i`.

Here's the updated state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `g` remains 0.
- `v1` remains 0.
- `v2` is now `i`.
- `prev` remains the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `kp` remains incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1.**
