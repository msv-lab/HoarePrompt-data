To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This variable does not affect the print statement directly.
- `n` must be greater than 1. This variable also does not affect the print statement directly.
- `g` is initialized to 0. This variable does not affect the print statement directly.
- `v1` is initialized to 0.
- `v2` is set to `i`. However, the value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `v2`.
- `prev` is described as the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists. This variable does not affect the print statement directly.
- `kp` is incremented by 1. This variable does not affect the print statement directly.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

We know:
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is `i`, but since the value of `i` is not specified, we represent it as `i`.

Thus, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value assigned to v2)**
