Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This represents the number of test cases, but it's not directly relevant to the current print statement.
- `n`: Greater than 1. This indicates the size of some array or list.
- `g`: Set to 0. This variable is not used in the print statement.
- `v1`: The index of the maximum element in the array. This means `v1` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`.
- `v2`: Set to `n-1`. This is the last index of the array.
- `prev`: Set to `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged. Since there's no information about the value of `r` or `i` before this assignment, we cannot determine the exact value of `prev` definitively. However, we know that `prev` could potentially be `i`.
- `kp`: Set to `n-1`. This variable is not used in the print statement.
- `r`: The input string. The exact content of this string is unknown, so we can't determine if `prev` was set to `i` or not.
- `i`: Incremented by 1. The exact value of `i` before this increment is unknown, but after the increment, `i` will be one more than its previous value.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

- `v1`: As mentioned, `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array. We don't know the exact index, but it is an integer between 0 and `n-1`.
- `i`: After being incremented by 1, `i` will be one more than its previous value. Without knowing the initial value of `i`, we can only say that it is some integer.
- `v1`: This is repeated in the print statement, so it will have the same value as described above.
- `prev`: As discussed, `prev` could be `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise it remains unchanged. Since we do not have the value of `r` or the initial value of `prev`, we can only describe it as potentially being `i` or its previous value.

### Final Output Description:
Given the information provided, the output will be in the form `? v1 i v1 prev`, where:
- `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array.
- `i` is the incremented value of `i`.
- `prev` is either `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, or its previous value.

Since we do not have the exact values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev`, we describe them in terms of their definitions and possible states.

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the index of the maximum element in the array, i is the incremented value of i, and prev is either i if r equals '>', or its previous value)**
