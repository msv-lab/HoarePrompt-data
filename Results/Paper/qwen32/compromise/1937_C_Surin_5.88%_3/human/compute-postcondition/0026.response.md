The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the current value of `v2` to `v1`. Given the initial state, `v2` is `i + 1`. Therefore, after the assignment, `v1` will also be `i + 1`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i + 1`, `v1` is `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is the input value**.

In natural language: After executing the code, `v1` now holds the same value as `v2`, which is `i + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values or states.
