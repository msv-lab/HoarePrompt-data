Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, and `r` is the user's input. If `r` is '<', then `v1` and `v2` are both set to `i + 1`. Otherwise, `v1` remains `i` and `v2` remains `i + 1`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
