Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. The program does not correctly handle the logic to find pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.
2. The program does not consider cases where more than one pair of friends needs to be invited to ensure at least two friends attend the party.
3. The program incorrectly assumes that if a friend and their best friend form a mutual pair, then only 2 invitations are needed. This is not always true, especially if there are no mutual pairs.
4. The program does not implement a method to find the smallest set of invitations that guarantees at least two friends attend.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        components = []

        # Find connected components
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if not visited[i]:
                component = []
                x = i
                while not visited[x]:
                    visited[x] = True
                    component.append(x)
                    x = p[x - 1]
                components.append(component)

        # Determine the minimum number of invitations
        min_invitations = float('inf')
        for component in components:
            if len(component) == 1:
                min_invitations = min(min_invitations, 3)
            elif len(component) == 2:
                min_invitations = min(min_invitations, 2)
            else:
                min_invitations = min(min_invitations, (len(component) + 1) // 2)

        print(min_invitations)

func()
```

This corrected version finds all connected components in the graph formed by the friendships and calculates the minimum number of invitations needed based on the size of each component.
