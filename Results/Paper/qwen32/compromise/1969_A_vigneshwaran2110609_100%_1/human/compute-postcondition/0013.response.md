Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True; `i` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
