To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)
```

Here is the breakdown of the loop:
1. The outer loop runs `n` times, with `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
2. In each iteration of the outer loop, `x` is read as an integer input, and `l` is read as a list of `x` integers.
3. The inner loop runs `x` times, with `i` ranging from `0` to `x-1`.
4. Inside the inner loop, the condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is checked. If true, `flag` is set to `True`, `2` is printed, and the inner loop breaks.
5. If the inner loop completes without breaking, `3` is printed.

From the provided output states:
- After the first iteration, `3` is printed.
- After the second iteration, `3` is printed.
- After the third iteration, `3` is printed.

This indicates that for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop completes without breaking, meaning the condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is never met.

Given this pattern, we can deduce that for all `n` iterations, the inner loop will complete without breaking, and `3` will be printed in each iteration.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is that `3` is printed `n` times.

Output State: **3 is printed n times.**
