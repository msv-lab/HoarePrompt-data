You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the number of subarrays of length `m` in array `a` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counting Matches in the First Subarray**:
   - The program initializes sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra`.
   - `todo` contains the elements of `b` that need to be matched.
   - `done` will contain elements from the current subarray `a` that are also in `b`.
   - `extra` will contain elements from the current subarray `a` that are not in `b`.
   - The program iterates through the first `m` elements of `a` and updates `todo`, `done`, and `extra` accordingly.
   - It checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` and initializes `ans` to 1 if true, otherwise 0.

3. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - The program then uses a sliding window approach to check the remaining subarrays.
   - For each new element added to the window (from `a[r]`), it removes the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[r - m]`).
   - It updates `todo`, `done`, and `extra` based on the element that is sliding out.
   - It then adds the new element and updates `todo`, `done`, and `extra` accordingly.
   - It checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` and increments `ans` if true.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for the current test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Use of Sets**: The use of sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra` is not appropriate because sets do not account for the frequency of elements. For example, if `b` contains duplicate elements, the program will not correctly handle them.
- **Counting Matches**: The program should use a frequency counter (like `Counter` from the `collections` module) to keep track of the counts of elements in `b` and the current window in `a`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the use of sets and the need for frequency counting, the provided program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
