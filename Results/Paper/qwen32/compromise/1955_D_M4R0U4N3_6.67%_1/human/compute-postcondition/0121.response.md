The code snippet `todo.add(old)` adds the value of `old` to the set `todo`. Given the initial state, `old` is defined as `a[r - m]`. This operation modifies the set `todo` by including `old` as one of its elements.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the problem statement. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` and `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. `a[r]` is added to `done`. `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, and remains unchanged otherwise. `n` remains unchanged. `m` is less than `n`. `k` remains unchanged. `a` remains unchanged. `old` is `a[r - m]`. `todo` includes `old`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1. `r` is `m + 1`.**
