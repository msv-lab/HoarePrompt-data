The code `done.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the list `done`. Given the initial state, `r` is `r + 1` and `old` is `a[(r + 1) - m]`. After the execution, `r` remains `r + 1` and `old` remains `a[(r + 1) - m]`, but the list `done` will no longer contain the element `old`.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`; `old` is `a[(r + 1) - m]`; `old` has been removed from the list `done`.**
