The code snippet `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the set `extra`. Given the initial state, `old` is `a[r - m]` and `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, and remains unchanged otherwise. 

Since `old` is removed from `extra`, the set `extra` will no longer contain `old`. No other variables are affected by this operation, so their states remain the same.

Output State: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` if `old` is in `done`. `a[r]` is not in `todo`, so `a[r]` is added to `done`. `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, and `old` is removed from `extra`. `n` remains unchanged. `m` is less than `n`. `k` remains unchanged. `a` remains unchanged. `old` is `a[r - m]`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1. `r` is `m + 1`.**
