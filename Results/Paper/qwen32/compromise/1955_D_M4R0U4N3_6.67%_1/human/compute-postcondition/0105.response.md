Output State: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old`; `todo` is a set containing the element `old`; `extra` is the set of all elements from `a` that were not originally in `todo` except `old`; `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `n` remains unchanged; `m` must be less than `n`; `k` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `old` is not in `extra`.**

Explanation: The element `old` is added to the `todo` set. Since `old` was originally not in `todo` (it was in `done`), it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Consequently, `extra` loses `old` as well because `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`. The values of `done`, `todo`, and `extra` are updated accordingly, while other variables remain unchanged.
