Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is 1, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with `a[1]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[1]` was in `todo` initially, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, and `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo` initially, otherwise `extra` is an empty set.**

In simpler terms, `done` now includes `a[1]` in addition to whatever it originally contained, and `todo` no longer contains `a[1]`. Other variables remain unchanged.
