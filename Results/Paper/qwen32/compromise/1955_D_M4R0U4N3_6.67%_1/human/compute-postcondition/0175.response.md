Postcondition: **`done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed, including `old`; `todo` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed; `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`; `ans` is 1 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `m` must be less than `n`; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` and `old` is in `done`.**
