The code snippet provided is:

```
extra = set()
```

This line of code reassigns the variable `extra` to a new empty set. The other variables (`done`, `todo`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`done` is an empty set; `todo` contains unique integers from the input; `extra` is an empty set; `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`; `n` is the first input integer; `m` is the second input integer; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
