The code `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Given that `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` and is an element of `extra`, after the removal, `extra` will no longer contain `old`.

Output State: **`old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` and is no longer an element of `extra`.**
