The code snippet `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Given the initial state, `a[r]` is not in `todo` and `a[r]` is added to `done`. Therefore, `a[r]` will be added to `extra` if it was not already present.

Let's break down the changes:
- `a[r]` is added to `extra`.
- `done` and `todo` remain as per their initial conditions unless `old` is involved in changes.
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `old` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `ans` remains the same unless there is a change in the number of elements in `done`.

The specific value of `a[r]` is not provided, but we know that `r` is `m + 2`. Thus, `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`.

Output State: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. `a[r]` is added to `done`. `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, `todo` includes `old`. If `old` is in `done` and in `extra`, `old` is removed from both `done` and `extra`; otherwise, if `old` is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and `todo` includes `old`. `n` remains unchanged, `m` is less than `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `old` is `a[2]`. `todo` does not include `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3; otherwise, `ans` is 2. `r` is `m + 2`. `extra` now includes `a[m + 2]`.**
