The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
