To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variable `ans` is manipulated.

From the initial state, we know:
- `done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed.
- `todo` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed.
- `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`.
- `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `len(done) >= k`.

The variable `ans` is incremented based on the condition `len(done) >= k`. However, the exact value of `ans` depends on the number of iterations where this condition is met. Since the initial state doesn't provide specific values for `done`, `k`, or the number of iterations, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the given condition.

Given that `ans` is incremented only when `len(done) >= k`, the value of `ans` will be the count of such iterations.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of iterations where the length of done is greater than or equal to k)**
