The provided code snippet only initializes the `extra` set to be an empty set. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `done`, `todo`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`done` is an empty set; `todo` is a set of integers from the input; `extra` is an empty set; `ans` is the count of times `len(done) >= k`; `n` is the first input integer; `m` is the second input integer; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
