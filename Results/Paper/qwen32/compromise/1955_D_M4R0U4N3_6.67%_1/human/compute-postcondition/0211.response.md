The code snippet adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This operation does not affect the values of `r`, `old`, `m`, `a`, `done`, or `todo` directly, except for the modification to `extra`.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `done` or `todo`. `extra` contains `a[r]` and any other elements it had previously.**
