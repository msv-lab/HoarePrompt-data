The code snippet `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element `a[j]` from the set `todo`. 

Given the initial state, `todo` contains unique integers from the input, and `a[j]` is one of those integers. After executing the code, `a[j]` is no longer in `todo`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`done` is an empty set; `todo` contains unique integers from the input except `a[j]`; `extra` is an empty set; `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`; `n` is the first input integer; `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `j` is not adjusted before the loop starts; `a[j]` is not in `todo`.**
