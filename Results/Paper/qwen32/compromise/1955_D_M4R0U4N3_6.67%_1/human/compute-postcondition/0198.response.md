The code snippet `extra.add(a[r])` adds the value of `a[r]` to the set `extra`. The values of `r`, `old`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` are affected by the initial state conditions, but only `extra` is directly modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `r` is incremented by 1, and `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. Depending on whether `old` is in `extra` or `done`, `extra` or `todo` may be modified. However, the provided code snippet only modifies `extra` by adding `a[r]` to it.

Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` has `old` removed from it. Otherwise, if `old` is in `done`, `done` does not contain the value of `old` and `todo` contains the value of `old`. `extra` contains the value of `a[r]`.**

In natural language: After executing the code, `r` has been incremented by 1, and `old` holds the value of `a[r - m]`. The set `extra` now includes the value of `a[r]`. The conditions regarding `old`, `done`, and `todo` remain as stated in the initial state, with the addition of `a[r]` to `extra`.
