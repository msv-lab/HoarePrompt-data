Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`; `todo` is an empty set; `extra` is the set of all elements from `a` that were not originally in `todo`; `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` if `old` is in `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `done`. `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, and remains unchanged otherwise. `n` remains unchanged. `m` is less than `n`. `k` remains unchanged. `a` remains unchanged. `old` is `a[r - m]`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. `a[r]` is added to `done`. `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, `todo` includes `old`. `n` remains unchanged, `m` is less than `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `old` is `a[r - m]`. `todo` does not include `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3; otherwise, `ans` is 2. `r` is `m + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. `a[r]` is added to `done`. `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, `todo` includes `old`. If `old` is in `done` and in `extra`, `old` is removed from both `done` and `extra`; otherwise, if `old` is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and `todo` includes `old`. `n` remains unchanged, `m` is less than `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `old` is `a[2]`. `todo` does not include `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 4; otherwise, `ans` is 3. `r` is `m + 2`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, `extra` now includes `a[m + 2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
