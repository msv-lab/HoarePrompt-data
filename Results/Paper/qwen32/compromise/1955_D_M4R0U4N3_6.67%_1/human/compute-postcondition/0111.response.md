Postcondition: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` if `old` is in `done`. `todo` is either an empty set or contains the element `old` if `old` was in `done`. `extra` is the set of all elements from `a` that were not originally in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `done` or `extra` if `old` was in `extra`. `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. `n` remains unchanged. `m` is less than `n`. `k` remains unchanged. `a` remains unchanged. `old` is `a[r - m]`. `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**
