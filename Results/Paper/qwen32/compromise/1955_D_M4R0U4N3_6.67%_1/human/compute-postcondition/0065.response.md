The code snippet adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`. The initial state tells us that `r` is `r + 2` and `old` is `a[r - m]`. The element `a[r]` has been removed from `todo`. 

Since `a[r]` is added to `done`, the set `done` now includes this element. The other variables (`r`, `old`, `a`, `todo`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions, but `a[r]` is no longer part of `todo`.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `a[r]` has been removed from `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `done`.**
