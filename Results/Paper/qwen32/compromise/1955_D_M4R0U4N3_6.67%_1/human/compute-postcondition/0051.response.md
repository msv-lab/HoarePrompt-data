The code snippet removes the element `a[r]` from the list `todo`. Given the initial state, `r` is `r + 1` and `old` is `a[(r + 1) - m]`. However, the value of `a[r]` is what gets removed from `todo`. The values of `r`, `old`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` are affected as follows:

- `todo` has `a[r]` removed from it.
- `r` remains `r + 1`.
- `old` remains `a[(r + 1) - m]` as it is not affected by the removal of `a[r]` from `todo`.

The elements in `extra` and `done` remain unchanged unless `a[r]` was one of the elements in `done` or `extra`, but the code only specifies the removal from `todo`. Therefore, we only know for certain that `todo` has lost the element `a[r]`.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`; `old` is `a[(r + 1) - m]`; `todo` has `a[r]` removed from it.**
