Postcondition: **`done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed, excluding `old` if `old` was in `done`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is now included in `done` and excluded from `todo`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, it is now included in `extra`. `todo` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed, including `old` if `old` was in `done`, and excluding `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`. `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, and `extra` does not include `old` if `old` was originally in `extra`, and includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. `ans` is 1 since `len(done) >= k`. `m` must be less than `n`. `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`.**
