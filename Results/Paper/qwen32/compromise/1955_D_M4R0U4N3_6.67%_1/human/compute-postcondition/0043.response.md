Postcondition: **`old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` and is not an element of `extra`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `a[r]` is added to `extra`. The state remains unchanged with respect to `done` and `todo` except as specified. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
