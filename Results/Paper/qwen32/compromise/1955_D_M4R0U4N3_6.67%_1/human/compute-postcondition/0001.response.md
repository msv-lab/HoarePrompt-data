The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State includes the initial state of `t` and the newly assigned values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input.**
