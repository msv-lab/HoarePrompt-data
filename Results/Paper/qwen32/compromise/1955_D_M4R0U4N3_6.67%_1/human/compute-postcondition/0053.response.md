The code snippet adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Therefore, the set `extra` will include `a[r]` after the execution. The values of `r`, `old`, `a`, `m`, `done`, and `todo` remain unchanged unless `a[r]` was already in `extra`, in which case adding it again has no effect since sets do not allow duplicate elements.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 1` and `old` is `a[(r + 1) - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was not in `extra` and it is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, there is no change to `done` or `todo`. `extra` includes `a[r]`.**
