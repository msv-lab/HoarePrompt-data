The code snippet provided removes the value of `old` from the set `done`. Given the initial state, `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. After the execution of the code, `done` will no longer contain the value of `old`.

Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`; `done` does not contain the value of `old`.**
