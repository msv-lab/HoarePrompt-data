Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with `a[0]` removed, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The only change is that `a[0]` (which is `a[j]` since `j` is 0) has been removed from the set `todo`. All other variables remain unchanged.
