Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `done` is an empty set; `todo` is a set of integers from the input; `extra` is an empty set; `ans` is the count of times `len(done) >= k`; `n` is the first input integer; `m` is the second input integer; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `j` are defined as per the initial conditions. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `done` contains `a[j]`, `todo` excludes `a[j]`, and `extra` remains empty. Otherwise, `done` remains empty, `todo` remains unchanged, and `extra` contains `a[j]`. The count `ans` reflects the number of times the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions. `j` is incremented by 1. If `a[j]` was in `todo`, then `done` contains `a[j]` and `todo` no longer contains `a[j]`. Otherwise, `extra` includes the element `a[j]` from the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `a[j]` was in `todo`, then `done` includes the element `a[j]` and `todo` is missing the element `a[j]`. Otherwise, `done`, `todo`, and `extra` all include `a[j]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
