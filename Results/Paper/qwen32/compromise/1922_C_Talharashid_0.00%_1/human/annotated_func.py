#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, a is a list of n integers in ascending order where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each query, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Additionally, for each city in every test case, the closest city is uniquely determined.

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, i is equal to t - 1 (indicating all test cases have been processed), d1 and d2 are defaultdicts with default int values populated for all relevant keys, n is an input integer, lst is a list of integers, start and end are the final values read from the input minus 1, inc is -1, m is the total number of iterations for the last test case, s is 0, mini is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, and all queries for all test cases have been processed and their results printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of city coordinates and a series of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the minimum distance required to travel from one city to another, considering the closest city uniquely determined for each.
