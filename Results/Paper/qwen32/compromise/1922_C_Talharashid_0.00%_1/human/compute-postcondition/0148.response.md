Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, and `s` is either 0 or `abs(lst[m] - lst[m + 1])`. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` (considering the conditions for `start - 1 > -1` and `start + 1 < len(lst)`), and `s` is set to `abs(lst[m] - lst[m + 1])`.**
