The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `start` and `end`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the values of `start` and `end` are updated to the values provided by the input, while all other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` and `end` are the values obtained from the input, `inc` is -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is the final cumulative value after all iterations, and `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.**
