Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is 0. If `start + 1 < len(lst)`, then `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**
