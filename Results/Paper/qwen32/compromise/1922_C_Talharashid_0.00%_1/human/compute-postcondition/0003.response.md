Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values.**

Explanation: The code snippet creates a new defaultdict `d2` with default integer values. The values of `t`, `i`, and `d1` remain unchanged.
