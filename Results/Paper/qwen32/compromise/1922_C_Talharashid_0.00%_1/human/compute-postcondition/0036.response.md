The `while` loop condition is `start != end`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `start` and `end` such that `start` is not equal to `end`.

Given:
- `start` is initially set to `end`.
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`.

For the loop to execute, `start` must be different from `end`. Since `end` is fixed at `len(lst) - 1`, we need to adjust `start`.

Let's adjust `start` to be `end - 1` (or any other value not equal to `end` as long as it makes sense in the context of the loop logic). This way, `start` will be different from `end`, and the loop can execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d1[len(lst) - 1]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `end - 1`, `mini` is updated to `min(mini, abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]))` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` retains its initial value**.
