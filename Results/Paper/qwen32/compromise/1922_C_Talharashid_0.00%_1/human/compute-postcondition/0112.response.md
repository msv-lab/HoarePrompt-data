The code snippet `s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` updates the value of `s2` based on the values of `d1` at indices `start` and `end`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the new value read from the input minus 1, `end` is the new value read from the input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`. If `start` is less than `end`, the previous value of `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, the previous value of `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
