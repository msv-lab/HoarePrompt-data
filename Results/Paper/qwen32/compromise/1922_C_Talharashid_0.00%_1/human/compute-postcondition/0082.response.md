The code snippet updates the value of `mini` by taking the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`.

Given:
- `mini` is initially the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111.
- `start` is `len(lst) - 3`.

After executing the line `mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)`, `mini` will be the minimum of its current value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start]` is `s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`.**
