The code snippet provided initializes `d2` as a new `defaultdict` with default integer values. This action overwrites the previous `d2` which had values assigned to it from `len(lst) - 1` to `0`. 

The values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `n`, `lst`, `start`, `end`, `inc`, `m`, `s`, and `mini` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2*m + 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a new defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` and `end` are the values read in the last iteration and have been decremented, `inc` is -1, `m` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.**
