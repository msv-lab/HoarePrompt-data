The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `mini` to `11111111`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d2[start]` is `s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is 11111111.**
