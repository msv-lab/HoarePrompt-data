The code snippet provided is simply reading an integer from the input and assigning it to the variable `n`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the value of `n` which is now the integer read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the value read from the input in the last iteration minus 1, `end` is the value read from the input in the last iteration minus 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`. `d2` has been reset to a new defaultdict with default int values.**
