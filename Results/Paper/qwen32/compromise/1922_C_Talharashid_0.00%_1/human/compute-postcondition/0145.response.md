The code snippet provided increments the variable `s` by 1. None of the other variables are modified. Therefore, the value of `s` changes from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is 1. If `start - 1 > -1`, then `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. Otherwise, `mini` is either 11111111 or the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` based on whether `start + 1 < len(lst)` or not. The current value of `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**
