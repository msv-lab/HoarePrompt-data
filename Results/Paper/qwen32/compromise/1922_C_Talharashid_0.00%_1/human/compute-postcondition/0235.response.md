Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` and `end` are the values read from the input, `inc` is -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if `start` is less than `end`, otherwise `s1` is 0 and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`. `start` is decreased by 1. `end` is decreased by 1.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `s1` is updated to the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. The values of `start` and `end` are each decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
