The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[m] - lst[m + 1]) + 1`, `start` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.**
