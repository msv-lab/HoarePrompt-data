Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m - 1`, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the value read from the input in the last iteration minus 1, `end` is the value read from the input in the last iteration minus 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop variable `i` will be equal to `m - 1` (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration). The variables `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `inc`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state or as defined by the problem statement. The variables `start` and `end` will hold the values read from the input in the last iteration, decremented by 1. The variable `s` will be 0, and `s1` and `s2` will be calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop body. The variable `mini` will store the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.
