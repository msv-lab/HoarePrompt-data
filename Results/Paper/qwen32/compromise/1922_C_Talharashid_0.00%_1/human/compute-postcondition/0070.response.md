Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d2[start]` is `s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the smaller of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**
