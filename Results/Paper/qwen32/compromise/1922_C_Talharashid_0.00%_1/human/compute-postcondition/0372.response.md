Given the provided initial state and the code snippet, we can determine the new state after executing the line `s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`.

The code calculates the absolute difference between the values of `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and assigns this value to `s1`. No other variables are modified by this line.

Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 2, `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration, `d2` will have keys from `len(lst) - 1` to `1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration, `n` remains the same, `lst` remains the same, `end` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `inc` is -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is the first integer from the new input minus 2, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`.**

In natural language: The value of `s1` is now the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
