Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d1[len(lst) - 1]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `end - 1`, and `mini` is the minimum of `11111111`, the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`, and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the minimum of `11111111` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`.**
