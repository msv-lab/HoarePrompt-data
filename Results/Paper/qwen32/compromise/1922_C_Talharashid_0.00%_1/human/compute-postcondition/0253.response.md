The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `2*m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2*m + 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where d1[start] = s for each start from 0 to end - 1, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and d2[start] = s for each start from len(lst) - 1 to 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` and `end` are the values read in the last iteration and have been decremented, `inc` is -1, `m` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.**
