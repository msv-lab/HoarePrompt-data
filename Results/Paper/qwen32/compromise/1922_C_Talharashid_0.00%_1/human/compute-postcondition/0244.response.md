Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is m, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is now `start - 1`, `end` are the values read from the input and have been decremented by 2, `inc` is -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration. If `start` was less than `end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

Explanation: The value of `end` has been decremented by 1, so the new value of `end` is the previous value minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
