The `while` loop condition is `start != end`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `start` and `end` so that they are not equal.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` is `len(lst) - 3`
- `end` is `0`

Since `start` and `end` are not equal (assuming `len(lst) - 3` is not `0`), the loop can certainly execute one more time. However, if we need to adjust the state to ensure it can execute, we can simply keep `start` as `len(lst) - 3` and `end` as `0` because the condition `start != end` is already satisfied.

Therefore, no further adjustment is needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start]` is `s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the smaller of 11111111, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**
