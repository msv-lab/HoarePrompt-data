Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed and does not properly check the conditions required to achieve equal water distribution among the containers.

The correct approach involves checking if the prefix sums of the containers can be made to match the target value (which is the total water divided by the number of containers) at each step. The given program does not implement this logic correctly and instead checks an incorrect condition. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total = sum(nums)
        target = total // n
        prefix_sum = 0
        possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum += nums[i]
            if prefix_sum > target * (i + 1):
                possible = False
                break
        if possible and prefix_sum == total:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the prefix sum and checks if it can match the target value at each step, ensuring that the water can be distributed equally among the containers using the allowed operations.
