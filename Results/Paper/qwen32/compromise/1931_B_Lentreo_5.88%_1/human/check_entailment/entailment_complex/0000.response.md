Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic used in the program is flawed.

The program calculates `curr` as the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`. This approach does not correctly account for the redistribution of water as described in the problem. The key point is that water can only be poured from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`. The program does not consider the possibility of pouring water between any two containers that satisfy this condition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine if the cumulative sum of water in the containers can be made equal to the average amount of water per container by only pouring water from a left container to a right container. The correct approach would involve checking if, for each container, the cumulative sum of water up to that container can be made equal to the product of the average water level and the number of containers considered so far.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total sum of water divided by the number of containers.
2. Iterate through the list of water amounts and keep a running sum.
3. For each container, check if the running sum is equal to the target amount multiplied by the number of containers considered so far. If it is not possible to achieve this for any container, then it is not possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

Given the flawed logic in the provided program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
