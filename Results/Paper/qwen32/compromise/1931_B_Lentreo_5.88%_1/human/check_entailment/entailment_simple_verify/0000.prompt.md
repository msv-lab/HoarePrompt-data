You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, it has read an integer `n`, a list of `n` integers `nums`, computed `last` as the last element of `nums`, and calculated `curr` as the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`. If `curr` is 0, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. After all iterations, `t` is decremented to 0, and no further iterations occur.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly account for the conditions specified in the problem description.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
3. It then calculates `last` as the last element in the list `nums`.
4. It initializes `curr` to 0 and iterates through the list `nums`. For each element `i` that is not 0, it adds `i - last` to `curr`.
5. Finally, it checks if `curr` is 0. If it is, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic in the program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the water can be distributed equally among the containers. The program does not consider the cumulative sum of the water in the containers and whether it can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if we can redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount. This can be done by checking if the prefix sums of the containers can be adjusted to make all containers have the average amount of water.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        target = total_sum // n  # Since the sum is divisible by n, this is the target amount for each container
        current_sum = 0
        can_distribute = True
        
        for num in nums:
            current_sum += num
            if current_sum > target * (nums.index(num) + 1):
                can_distribute = False
                break
        
        if can_distribute:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the corrected version, we calculate the target amount of water each container should have (`target`). We then iterate through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative sum (`current_sum`). If at any point the cumulative sum exceeds the expected sum for the number of containers processed so far, it means we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have the target amount, and we print "NO". Otherwise, we print "YES".

Given the original program does not correctly implement this logic, the correctness of the original program is **False**.
