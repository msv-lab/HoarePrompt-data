### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the correct logic to determine if the water can be redistributed equally among the containers. Let's break down the issues with the original program and confirm the correctness of the assessment.

1. **Program Logic Evaluation**:
   - The program calculates `last` as the last element of the list `nums`.
   - It then calculates `curr` as the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`.
   - If `curr` is 0, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

   This logic does not correctly determine if the water can be redistributed equally. The program does not consider the cumulative sum of the water in the containers and whether it can be adjusted to make all containers have the same amount of water.

2. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations state that the program checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element and the last element of the list is zero. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - This is not a correct approach for solving the problem as it does not account for the cumulative redistribution of water.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach is to check if the prefix sums of the containers can be adjusted to make all containers have the average amount of water.
   - The corrected version of the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target`).
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative sum (`current_sum`).
   - If at any point the cumulative sum exceeds the expected sum for the number of containers processed so far, it means we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have the target amount, and we print "NO". Otherwise, we print "YES".

### Conclusion:

The original program's logic is flawed and does not correctly determine if the water can be redistributed equally among the containers. The original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
