The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it iterates over the elements in the list `nums`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `i` from the previous iteration, which is `next_i`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will take the next value from the list `nums`.

Since the loop iterates over `nums`, the state of `nums` itself does not change; only the value of `i` changes. The variables `curr`, `next_i`, and `last` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Given that `i` at the end of the previous iteration was `next_i`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the subsequent element in `nums` after `next_i`.

State: **`i` is the next element in `nums` after `next_i`**
