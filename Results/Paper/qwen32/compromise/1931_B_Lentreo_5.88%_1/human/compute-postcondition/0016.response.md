To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `nums`. For each element, if `i` is not 0, it updates `curr` by adding the difference between `i` and `last` to `curr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from input.
- `last` is the last element of `nums`.
- `curr` is initialized to 0.

The loop modifies `curr` based on the values in `nums` except for the last element, because `last` is the last element and is not used in the calculation for `curr` during the loop.

The output state after all iterations will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `nums` remains unchanged.
- `last` remains the last element of `nums`.
- `curr` will be the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in `nums` except the last element, where `i` is not 0.

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, the variable `curr` will hold the sum of the differences between each element of `nums` (except the last one) and the last element, but only for those elements that are not 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is the sum of (i - last) for all i in nums except the last element, where i is not 0.**
