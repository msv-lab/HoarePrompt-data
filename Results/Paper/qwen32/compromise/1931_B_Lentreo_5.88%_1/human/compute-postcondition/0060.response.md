The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables and their properties, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely dependent on the string provided within it.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is: `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables described in the initial state (`_`, `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, `curr`) are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Based on this, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
