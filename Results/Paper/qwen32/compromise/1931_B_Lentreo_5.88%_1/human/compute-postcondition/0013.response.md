The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums` and the current element `i` in the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last element considered from the list `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the list `nums` to be assigned to `i`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `nums` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element
- `i` is the next element in `nums` after the last one considered

After the last iteration, `i` was the last element of `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `nums` must have at least one more element, and `i` should be that next element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:
State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least two elements, `i` is the next element in `nums` after the last one considered**
