The code assigns the last element of the list `nums` to the variable `last`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The new variable `last` will hold the value of the last element in the list `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers read from input; `last` is the last element of `nums`.**
