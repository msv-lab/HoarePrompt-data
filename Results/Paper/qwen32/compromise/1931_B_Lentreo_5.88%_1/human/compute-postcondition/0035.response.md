Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is the new list of integers read from input and must have more than 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is increased by `i - last`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `curr` is updated by adding the difference between the last element of `nums` (which is both `i` and `last` in this case) to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
