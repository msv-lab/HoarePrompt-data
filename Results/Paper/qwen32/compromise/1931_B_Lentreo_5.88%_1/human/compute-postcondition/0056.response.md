The value of `curr` is updated by adding the difference between `i` and `last` to it. The values of `i`, `last`, and `nums` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the next element in `nums` after `next_i`; `last` remains the same; `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in `nums` after `next_i`; `last` remains the same; `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`**.
