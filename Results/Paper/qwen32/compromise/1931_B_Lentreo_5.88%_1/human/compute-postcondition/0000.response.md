The provided code snippet reads an integer `t` from the input. This integer represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `a`) and their conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for each test case; the sum of `a_i` for each test case is divisible by `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
