Postcondition: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 3; `right` is `len(s) - 1`. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `cost` is increased by `len(s) - 3`.**
