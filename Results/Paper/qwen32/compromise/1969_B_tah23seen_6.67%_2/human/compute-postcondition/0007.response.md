Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. The variable `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `s` will contain all the strings that were originally in `sChar`. Each string in `sChar` consists only of '0's and '1's, and each string has a length between 2 and 200,000 characters. The state of `sChar` remains unchanged, and `s` now holds a copy of all the strings from `sChar`.
