To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as two conditions are met:
1. `right` is less than the length of `s`.
2. The character at index `right` in `s` is not '0'.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5.
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar`.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is 3.
- `s[1]` is '1'.
- `s[2]` is '1'.
- If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `cost` is 2; otherwise, `cost` remains 0.

We need to ensure that both conditions for the `while` loop are satisfied for the next iteration:
1. `right` should be less than the length of `s`.
2. `s[right]` should not be '0'.

At the end of the previous iteration, `right` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `s[3]` should be '1' (since `s[right]` should not be '0') and `right` should still be less than the length of `s`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `s[3]` is '1'. No other adjustments are necessary because the problem specifies no constraints on the length of `s` beyond it being at least 4 (since `right` is 3 and must be less than the length of `s`).

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar`; `left` is 0; `right` is 3; `s[1]` is '1'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'**
