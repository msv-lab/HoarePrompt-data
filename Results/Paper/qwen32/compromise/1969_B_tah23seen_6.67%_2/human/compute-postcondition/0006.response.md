The code snippet `s.append(i)` appends the variable `i` to the list `s`. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the initial state description, as it mentions `sChar` instead of `s`. Assuming the intention was to append to `sChar`, here's the output state:

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5, `sChar` now contains at least two such strings including the next `i` to be processed. Additionally, `sChar` includes the new element `i` appended to it.**

In simpler terms, the list `sChar` now includes the new element `i` along with its existing elements, and all other conditions mentioned in the initial state remain valid.
