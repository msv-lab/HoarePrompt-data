In this case, the loop iterates over each string `i` in the list `sChar`. The loop head only involves the variable `i` and the list `sChar`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what happens after the current iteration completes.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5.
- `sChar` now contains at least three such strings including the newly appended `i`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `sChar`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next string in the list `sChar`.

Let's denote the current string being processed as `i_k` (the k-th string in `sChar`). After processing `i_k`, the next string to be processed will be `i_{k+1}`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be the next string in `sChar` after the current one.
- `sChar` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify the list itself, only iterates over it.

Since we know that `sChar` contains at least three strings, and we have just finished processing one of them, there is at least one more string left to process.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5, `sChar` now contains at least two such strings including the next `i` to be processed.**
