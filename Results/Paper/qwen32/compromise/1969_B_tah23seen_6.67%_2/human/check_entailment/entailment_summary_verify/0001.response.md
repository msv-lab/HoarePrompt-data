### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` to determine if it correctly solves the problem of sorting a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost using cyclic shifts.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to transform a binary string into a sorted string (all `0`s followed by all `1`s) using the minimum cost.
- The cost of an operation is the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads multiple test cases and processes each binary string using the function `func_1`.
- The function `func_1` attempts to swap '0's and '1's to achieve the sorted order, but it does not correctly calculate the cost or handle the operations optimally.

#### Function `func_1` Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Converts the input string `sChar` into a list `s`.
   - Initializes pointers `left` and `right` to 0 and 1, respectively, and sets `cost` to 0.
   
2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues while `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is less than the length of `s`, and `left` is less than the length of `s`.
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', it swaps these two elements and adds the cost `right - left + 1` to the total cost.
   - It then moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' in the string.
   - It also moves the `left` pointer to the next '1' in the string.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation `right - left + 1` is incorrect because it assumes a direct swap between `s[right]` and `s[left]`. However, the problem requires cyclic shifts, which can involve moving a '0' past multiple '1's, potentially requiring a different cost calculation.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program only swaps adjacent '0's and '1's, which may not lead to the minimum cost solution. Cyclic shifts can be more complex and may involve larger substrings.
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed to move a '0' past several '1's efficiently.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program might not handle edge cases correctly, such as strings with all '0's or all '1's, or strings that require more complex cyclic shifts.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Identify the boundary between '0's and '1's.
- Calculate the cost of moving all '0's to the left of all '1's using cyclic shifts.
- Ensure that the cost is minimized by considering the actual length of the substrings involved in the cyclic shifts.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the cost calculation and logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
