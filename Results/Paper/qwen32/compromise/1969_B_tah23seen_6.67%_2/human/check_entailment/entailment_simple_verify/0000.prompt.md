You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
    return cost

    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a list of strings where each string s consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string s satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total sum of the lengths of all strings in sChar does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. The variable `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar`.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1

            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: s is a list of all '0's followed by all '1's, left is the number of '0's, right is len(s), cost is the total number of swaps performed.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of swaps performed, which is stored in the variable `cost`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the allowed cyclic shifts. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Logic for Swapping**: The program attempts to swap '0's and '1's directly when they are found in the wrong order, but this approach does not account for the cost of cyclically shifting substrings. The cost is determined by the length of the substring being shifted, not just the swapping of two characters.

2. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The conditions in the `while` loops (`left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s))`) are not correctly structured to ensure that all necessary swaps are considered. Specifically, the condition `left <= right` can cause the loop to terminate prematurely or incorrectly.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the string is already sorted or nearly sorted optimally. For example, a string like "111000" should have a cost of 3, but the program might not compute this correctly.

4. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation `(right - left + 1)` is applied whenever a swap is made, but this does not reflect the actual cost of cyclically shifting the substring between indices `left` and `right`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
101011
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
5
```

While the program happens to give the correct output for this specific test case, it does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs. A more comprehensive analysis reveals that the program fails for other cases, such as:

**Test Case:**
```
1
11000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
6
```

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for sorting the binary string in all scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
