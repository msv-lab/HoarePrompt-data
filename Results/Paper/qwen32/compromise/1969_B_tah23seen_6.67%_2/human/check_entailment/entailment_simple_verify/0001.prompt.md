You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to sort a binary string `s` in non-descending order (i.e., all `0`s followed by all `1`s) using the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is defined as the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each containing a binary string. For each string, it calls `func_1(sChar)` to compute the minimum cost to sort the string.

#### Function `func_1(sChar)`
1. **Initialization**:
   - Converts the input string `sChar` into a list `s`.
   - Initializes `left` pointer to 0, `right` pointer to 1, and `cost` to 0.
   
2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues while `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is less than the length of `s`, and `left` is less than the length of `s`.
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', it swaps these two elements and adds the cost `right - left + 1` to the total cost.
   - It then moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' in the string.
   - It also moves the `left` pointer to the next '1' in the string.

### Issues with the Program
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation `right - left + 1` is not always correct. This formula assumes that swapping `s[right]` and `s[left]` directly results in the minimum cost, but this is not necessarily true for cyclic shifts.
   - The program does not consider the actual cost of cyclically shifting a substring to move a '0' past a '1'.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program only swaps adjacent '0's and '1's, which may not lead to the minimum cost solution.
   - It does not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed to move a '0' past several '1's efficiently.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program might not handle edge cases correctly, such as strings with all '0's or all '1's, or strings that require more complex cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion
Given the issues with the cost calculation and logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
