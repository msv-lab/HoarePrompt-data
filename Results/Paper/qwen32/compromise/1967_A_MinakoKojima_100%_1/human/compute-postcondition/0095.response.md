Postcondition: **`k` is 0; `ans` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)` since `k < dif * (i + 1)`; `res` is `n - 1` if `i` is 0, and `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)` if `i` is not 0; `ans_list` contains `ans`; `n` is at least 2; `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input; `dif` is not 0; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is not 0, the state of the variables remains as per the precondition.**
