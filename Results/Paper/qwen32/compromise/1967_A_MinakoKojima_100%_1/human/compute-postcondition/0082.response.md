Output State: **`ans` is `a[0] + dif`, `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0, `ans_list` contains `ans`, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, and `dif` is not 0. Additionally, `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is now the initial value of `a[0]` plus `dif`. All other variables remain unchanged.
