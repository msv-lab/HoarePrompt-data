The code snippet updates the value of `res` by adding the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `k`, `ans`, `a`, and `ans_list` remain unchanged. If `dif` (which is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`) is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`. `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`**.
