Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 2`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` where `0 <= i < n-1`. The current value of `dif` is 0, indicating that there are at least two consecutive equal elements in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `n - 1` to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
