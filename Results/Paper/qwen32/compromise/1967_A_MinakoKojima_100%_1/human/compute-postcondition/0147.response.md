Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is the first element of the sorted list `a`, `res` is `n - 2` if `dif` is 0, otherwise `res` remains `n - 1`, `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input. If `dif` is 0, the current difference between consecutive elements `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is 0.**
