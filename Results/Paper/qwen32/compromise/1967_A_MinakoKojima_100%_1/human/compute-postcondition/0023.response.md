Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `ans` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, and `dif` is not 0. Additionally, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, then `res` is `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`. If `i` is 0, then `res` is `n - 1`. There are no consecutive equal elements in the list `a` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
