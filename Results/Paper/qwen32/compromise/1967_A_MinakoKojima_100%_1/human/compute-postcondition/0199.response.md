The value of `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `k` by `n`. The values of `res`, `k`, `ans_list`, `a`, and `dif` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the final incremented value plus `k // n`, `res` is the remaining differences not covered by `k`, `k` is not 0, `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`, `a` and `dif` remain unchanged.**
