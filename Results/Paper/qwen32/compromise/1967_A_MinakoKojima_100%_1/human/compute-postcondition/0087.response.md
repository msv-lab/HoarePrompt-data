Postcondition: **`i` is not equal to 0, `ans` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0, `ans_list` contains `ans`, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, and `dif` is not 0. Additionally, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`**
