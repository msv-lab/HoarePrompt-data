Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, and `res` is updated to `n - 3` if `k >= dif * (i + 2)`, or `(n - 1) + k % (i + 2) - 1` if `k < dif * (i + 2)` and `i` is not 1, otherwise `res` remains `n - 2`. If `k < dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is set to 0, `ans` is set to the first element of the sorted list `a` plus `k // (i + 2)`, and `res` is set to `n - 1`. In both cases, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
