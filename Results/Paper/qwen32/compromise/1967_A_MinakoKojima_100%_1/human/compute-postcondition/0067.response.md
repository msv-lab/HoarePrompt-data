Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value based on the differences in the list `a`, plus `k // n` if `k` was not 0, now updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, `res` remains 0, `k` remains 0.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `res` to it. Since `res` is 0, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. The values of `res` and `k` remain 0.
