The code snippet `res = n - 1` assigns the value `n - 1` to the variable `res`. This change does not affect the other variables `n`, `k`, `ans`, `ans_list`, or `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is the first element of the sorted list `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**
