Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (t - 1)` and `k` is 0.**
