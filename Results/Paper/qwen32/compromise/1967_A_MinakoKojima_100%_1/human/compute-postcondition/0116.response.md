Postcondition: **`ans` is `a[0]` if `dif` is 0 and `k < dif * 5`, otherwise `ans` is `a[0] + k // 4 + dif` if `dif` is not 0 or `k >= dif * 5`. `res` is `n - 4 + k % 4 - 1` if `dif` is 0 and `k < dif * 5`, `n - 5` if `dif` is 0 and `k >= dif * 5`, or `n - 3 + k % 4 + k % 5 - 1` if `dif` is not 0. `ans_list` contains the updated `ans`. `n` is at least 6. `k` is `k - dif * 5` if `k >= dif * 5`, otherwise `k` is 0. `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input. `dif` is `a[6] - a[5]`. `i` is 5.**
