The code snippet `ans += dif` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `dif` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `k`, `a`, and `ans_list` remain unchanged. If `dif` (which is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`) is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `ans` is updated to `ans + dif`.**
