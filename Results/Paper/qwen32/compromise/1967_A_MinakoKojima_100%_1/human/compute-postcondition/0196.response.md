Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `a`, `ans_list`, `dif`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `dif` is not 0, the execution continues without any changes to `k`, `ans`, or `res`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `k` is 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues without any changes to `k`, `ans`, or `res`.**
