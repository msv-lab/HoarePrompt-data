The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `ans`, `res`, `k`, and `ans_list` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value based on the differences in the list `a`, plus `k // n` if `k` was not 0, now updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, `res` remains 0, `k` remains 0, `ans_list` contains `ans`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer.**
