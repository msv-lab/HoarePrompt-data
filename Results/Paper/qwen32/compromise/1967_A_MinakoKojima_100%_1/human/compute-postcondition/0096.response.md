Postcondition: **`ans` is `a[0]` if `dif` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)` since `k < dif * (i + 1)`. `res` is `n - 2` if `dif` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 1` if `i` is 0, and `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)` if `i` is not 0. `ans_list` contains `ans`. `n` is at least 2. `k` is 0 if `dif` is not 0, otherwise it retains its initial value. `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input. `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is not 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
