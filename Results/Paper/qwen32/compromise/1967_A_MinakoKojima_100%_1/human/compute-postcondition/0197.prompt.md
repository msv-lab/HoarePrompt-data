Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is the first element of the sorted list `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is either `k - dif * (i + 1)` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, or 0 if `k < dif * (i + 1)`. If `k == 0`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. `ans` is the first element of the sorted list `a` plus `dif` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, or the first element of the sorted list `a` plus `k // (i + 1)` if `k < dif * (i + 1)`. `res` is `n - 2` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, or `(n - 1) + k % (i + 1)` if `k < dif * (i + 1)` and `i` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains `n - 1`. `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`. `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input. The current difference between consecutive elements `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is not 0 if `dif != 0`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2` if `dif` is 0, otherwise `res` remains `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer greater than 1. If `dif` is not 0, the behavior of `k`, `ans`, `res`, `dif`, `a`, `ans_list`, and `i` is determined by the conditions specified in the precondition: if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, and `res` is updated based on whether `k >= dif * (i + 2)` or not; if `k < dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, `ans` is set to the first element of the sorted list `a` plus `k // (i + 2)`, and `res` is set to `n - 1`. In both cases, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `dif` is 0, `k`, `ans`, `res`, `dif`, `a`, `ans_list`, and `i` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `a`, `ans_list`, `dif`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `dif` is not 0, the execution continues without any changes to `k`, `ans`, or `res`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `k` is 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues without any changes to `k`, `ans`, or `res`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
