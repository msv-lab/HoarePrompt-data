The code snippet `res -= 1` indicates that the variable `res` is being decremented by 1. However, the initial state provided does not mention the variable `res`. Since `res` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide a specific value for it after the operation. 

Given that only `res` is affected and it is being decremented by 1, and considering the provided initial state, the output state will reflect this change. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, and `i` is `n - 2`; `res` is decreased by 1.**
