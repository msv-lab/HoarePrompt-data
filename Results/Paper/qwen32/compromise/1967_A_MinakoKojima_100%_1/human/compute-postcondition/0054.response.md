Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is increased by `k // (t - 1)`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, taking into account the condition `i != 0`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is updated by adding `k % (i + 1)` to it. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the precondition.
