The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not represent any state that needs to be adjusted. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`, and the loop variable `_` does not affect or get affected by the loop body.

Since the loop variable `_` does not need to be adjusted and the number of iterations is determined by the input, the state of other variables (`ans`, `res`, `k`, `ans_list`) should remain the same at the start of the next iteration as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value based on the differences in the list `a`, plus `k // n` if `k` was not 0, now updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, `res` remains 0, `k` remains 0, `ans_list` contains `ans`**
