Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12; `ans_list` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = a[0]
    res = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
        if dif == 0:
            res -= 1
        if dif != 0:
            if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                ans += dif
                k -= dif * (i + 1)
                res -= 1
            else:
                ans += k // (i + 1)
                if i != 0:
                    res += k % (i + 1)
                k = 0
                break
            if k == 0:
                break
    if k != 0:
        ans += k // n
        res += k % n
    ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
    ans += res
    ans_list.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is the maximum possible value based on the differences in the list `a`, plus `k // n` if `k` was not 0, now updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, `res` remains 0, `k` remains 0, `ans_list` contains `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is `ans * n - (n - 1) + res`, `res` is adjusted based on the number of non-zero `dif` values, and if `k` is not 0, `res` is further adjusted by `k % n`. `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`. `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is the final incremented value plus `k // n` if `k` is not 0, plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` plus `res`; `res` is the remaining differences not covered by `k` plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0; `k` is 0 or the remaining amount; `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans` if `k` is not 0; `a` and `dif` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
