Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `a`, `ans_list`, `dif`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)` and `ans` is updated to `ans + dif`. In both cases, if `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. If `k < dif * (i + 1)`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
