Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, and `dif` is not 0. If `k` is 0, `ans` is updated to `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, and if `i` is not 0, `res` is updated to `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`. If `i` is 0, `res` is `n - 1`. There are no consecutive equal elements in the list `a`. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0. If `k` is not 0, the state of `k`, `ans`, and `res` is not specified by the given conditions. If `dif` is 0, there are at least two consecutive equal elements in the list `a` and no changes are made to `ans` or `res`.**
