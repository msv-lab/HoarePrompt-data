Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is increased by `k // (t - 1)`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. `k` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
