The code snippet `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, `res` is decreased by 1.**
