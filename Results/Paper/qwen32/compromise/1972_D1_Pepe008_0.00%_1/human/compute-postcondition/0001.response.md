To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for t in range(T):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over the range defined by `T`, and the loop variable is `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `T` must be at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `T` is an integer read from the input representing the number of test cases

We need to adjust the state based on the loop head variables, which are `t` and `T`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `t`:**
   - The variable `t` is used as the loop variable in the `for` loop. However, its initial value (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is irrelevant to the loop execution because `t` is reassigned by the loop control mechanism.
   - Therefore, we don't need to adjust `t` before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `T`:**
   - The variable `T` determines how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `T` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - The initial state specifies that `T` is an integer read from the input, but we need to ensure that this integer is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `T` is at least 1. The initial value of `t` does not affect the loop execution.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1**
