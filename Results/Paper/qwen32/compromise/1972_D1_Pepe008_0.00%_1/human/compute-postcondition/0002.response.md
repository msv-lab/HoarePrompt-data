The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter. This list is assigned to the variable `info`. The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
