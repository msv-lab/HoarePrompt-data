Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is now `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`**

Natural Language: The value of `suma` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
