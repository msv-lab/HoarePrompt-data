Given the initial state, `i` is 4 and `b` must be at least 1. The variable `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we will keep it as `a` in our calculations.

The code calculates the value of `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Substituting `i` with 4, the formula becomes:

\[ x = (a - 4 \times (4 - 1)) // 4^2 + 1 \]
\[ x = (a - 4 \times 3) // 16 + 1 \]
\[ x = (a - 12) // 16 + 1 \]

Therefore, `x` is calculated as `(a - 12) // 16 + 1`.

The value of `b` remains unchanged as it is not used in the calculation of `x`.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - 12) // 16 + 1`**.
