Postcondition: **`t` is incremented by 1, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings from the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is `x` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, otherwise `suma` remains 0, and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**
