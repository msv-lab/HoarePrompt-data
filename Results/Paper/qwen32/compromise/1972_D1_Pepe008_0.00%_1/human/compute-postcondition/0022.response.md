The code snippet `info = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. This affects the `info` variable, which was previously described as a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.

Given the initial state, `info` is updated to the new list of strings obtained from the input. The values of `t`, `T`, `a`, `b`, and `suma` remain unchanged because they are not directly modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.**
