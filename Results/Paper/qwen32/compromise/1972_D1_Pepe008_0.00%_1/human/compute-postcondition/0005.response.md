The given code snippet initializes a variable `suma` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`) are modified by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is 0.**
