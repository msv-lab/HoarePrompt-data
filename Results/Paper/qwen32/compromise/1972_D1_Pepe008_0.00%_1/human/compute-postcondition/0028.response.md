Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) and `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`.**
