The provided code snippet contains nested loops and a conditional statement that prints certain values of `i` and `j`. However, it does not modify any of the variables `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, or `suma`. The only action performed is printing, which does not affect the state of the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that certain pairs of `(i, j)` may be printed during the execution of the loops.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.**
