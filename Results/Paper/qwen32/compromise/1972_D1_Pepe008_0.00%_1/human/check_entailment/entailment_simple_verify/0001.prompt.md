You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Condition Analysis

The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

This implies:
\[ a = (k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) - b \]
\[ a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1) \]

Thus, \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\). Let \(a = b \cdot x\), where \(x\) is an integer. Substituting this into the equation gives:
\[ b \cdot x + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(b \cdot x, b) \]
\[ b \cdot (x + 1) = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(x, 1) \]
\[ x + 1 = k \cdot \gcd(x, 1) \]

Since \(\gcd(x, 1) = 1\), we have:
\[ x + 1 = k \]
\[ x = k - 1 \]

Thus, \(x\) can be any integer from 1 to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).

### Correct Approach

To count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\):
- For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), count the number of multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\).
- This is given by \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).

### Provided Code Analysis

The provided code attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues:
1. The commented-out section suggests a nested loop approach which would be inefficient given the constraints.
2. The main logic uses a formula that does not correctly count the number of valid pairs.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
suma = 0
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
    if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
        suma += x
print(suma - 1)
```
This logic does not correctly implement the counting of multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\).

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation would look like this:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        result = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            result += n // b
        print(result)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
