### Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The commented-out code snippet in the annotated program suggests a brute-force approach that iterates through all possible pairs \((i, j)\) and checks the condition. However, this approach would be inefficient given the constraints (\(n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)).

The actual implementation provided in the function uses a more optimized approach. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The function reads the number of test cases \(T\).
2. **Loop through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads \(a\) and \(b\).
3. **Sum Calculation**: It initializes `suma` to 0 and then iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\). For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) as \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\) and adds it to `suma` if \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\).
4. **Print Result**: Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

The formula used inside the loop is derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The condition simplifies to finding \(a\) such that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\). By iterating over possible values of \(\gcd(a, b)\) (which is \(i\) in the loop), the formula calculates how many valid \(a\) exist for each \(i\).

Given the provided input-output examples and the logic in the code, the function appears to correctly compute the number of valid pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the solution for the given problem based on the described logic and the examples provided.

**Correctness: True**
