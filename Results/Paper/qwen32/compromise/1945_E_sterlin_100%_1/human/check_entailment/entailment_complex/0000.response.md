### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python code and its functions to determine if the program meets the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads a single integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases `t`.
   - It correctly reads and returns this integer.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into two integers `n` and `x`.
   - It correctly reads and returns these two integers as a map object.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers `p`, representing the permutation.
   - It correctly reads and returns this list of integers.

4. **Function `func_4` and `func_5`**:
   - These functions are not used in the provided code snippet. They read input as a string or a list of substrings but are not integrated into the main logic.
   - Since they are not used, we can ignore them for the purpose of this analysis.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic processes each test case as follows:
     - It reads `n` and `x` using `func_2`.
     - It reads the permutation `p` using `func_3`.
     - It creates a dictionary `num_indx` to map each number in the permutation to its index (1-based).
     - It initializes a list `seen` to keep track of which elements have been encountered during the binary search.
     - It performs a binary search on the permutation `p` to find the position where `p[left]` should be equal to `x`.
     - If `p[left]` is already equal to `x`, no swaps are needed, and it prints `0`.
     - If `x` has not been seen during the binary search, it prints `1` and suggests a swap to bring `x` to the correct position.
     - If `x` has been seen but is not at the correct position, it performs two swaps to bring `x` to the correct position and prints `2` along with the swap operations.

6. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is performed correctly according to the problem statement.
   - The logic to determine the number of swaps and which elements to swap is also correct based on the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles multiple test cases, performs the binary search, and determines the necessary swaps to ensure that `p[left]` is equal to `x` after the binary search.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
