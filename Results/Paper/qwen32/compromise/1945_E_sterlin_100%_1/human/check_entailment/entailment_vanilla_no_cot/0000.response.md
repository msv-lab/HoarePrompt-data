Correctness: **False**

The provided program only includes input handling functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) but does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. The program does not perform any operations to rearrange the permutation or implement the binary search algorithm. Therefore, it is incorrect based on the given problem description.
