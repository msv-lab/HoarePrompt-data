### Reasoning:

The task is to determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here is a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1()` reads an integer `t`, which is the number of test cases.
   - `func_2()` reads two integers `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3()` reads a permutation `p` of `n` integers for each test case.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation `p` to find the position `l` such that `p[l] == x`.
   - The binary search is done using two pointers `left` and `right` initialized to `0` and `n` respectively.
   - During the search, a `seen` list is used to keep track of which elements have been accessed during the binary search.

3. **Handling the Result**:
   - If `p[left] == x` after the binary search, no swaps are needed, and the result is `0`.
   - If `x` has not been seen during the binary search, a single swap is needed to bring `x` into the position `left + 1`.
   - If `x` has been seen, the algorithm identifies two unseen elements and performs two swaps to place `x` in the correct position.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the need for swaps based on whether `x` has been seen during the binary search.
   - The swaps are performed in a way that ensures `p[left]` will be `x` after the binary search completes.
   - The algorithm ensures that no more than 2 swaps are performed, as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem within the given constraints. It handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement and ensures that the binary search will find `x` after performing the necessary swaps.

**Correctness: True**
