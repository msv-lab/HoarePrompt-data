You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` binary integers (0s and 1s) with at least one 1. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of 0s between the first and last occurrence of 1 in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to move chips to form a single contiguous block with the minimum number of operations. Each operation involves moving a chip to the closest free cell to its left.

### Key Points:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of cells.
     - `arr`: A string of `n` characters where `0` represents a free cell and `1` represents a cell with a chip.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())  # Reads the input string and removes spaces
        x = arr.find('1')  # Finds the index of the first '1'
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')  # Finds the index of the first '1' from the end
        z = arr[x:n - y]  # Slices the array from the first '1' to the last '1'
        print(z.count('0'))  # Counts the number of '0's in the sliced array
```

#### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `arr` which represents the cells.

2. **Finding the First and Last '1':**
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `arr`.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the first occurrence of `1` from the end of `arr`. Since `arr[::-1]` reverses the string, `y` effectively gives the index of the last `1` from the original string.

3. **Slicing the Array:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This slices the array from the first `1` to the last `1`. The slice includes all the cells between the first and last `1` (inclusive).

4. **Counting the Free Cells:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of `0`s in the sliced array, which corresponds to the number of free cells between the first and last `1`. This count is the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips to form a single block.

### Verification:
- The program correctly identifies the first and last `1`s in the array.
- It then calculates the number of free cells between these two `1`s, which is the correct count of operations needed to form a single block.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
