You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: a sequence of integers, each representing the count of 0s between the first and last 1 for each of the t input arrays.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` binary integers (0s and 1s) with at least one 1. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of 0s between the first and last occurrence of 1 in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. Let's analyze why:

The given program calculates the number of zeros between the first and last '1' in the string, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The correct approach involves calculating the cost of moving all chips to either the leftmost or rightmost position of the existing chips.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Operations**: The program simply counts the zeros between the first and last '1'. This does not account for the fact that moving chips to the leftmost or rightmost position of the existing chips may require fewer moves.

2. **Example Case**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   5
   1 0 1 0 1
   ```
   - The program would find the first '1' at index 0 and the last '1' at index 4.
   - It would then consider the substring `10101` and count the zeros between the first and last '1', which is 2.
   - However, the correct answer is 2, but the program's method of counting zeros does not ensure the minimum operations in all cases.

3. **Another Example Case**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   5
   1 0 0 0 1
   ```
   - The program would find the first '1' at index 0 and the last '1' at index 4.
   - It would then consider the substring `10001` and count the zeros between the first and last '1', which is 3.
   - However, the correct answer is 2, as you can move one chip to the left of the other chip in two operations.

Therefore, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations in all cases. A correct approach would involve calculating the cost of moving all chips to the leftmost or rightmost position of the existing chips and choosing the minimum of the two.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        left_cost = 0
        right_cost = 0
        left_count = 0
        right_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == 1:
                left_cost += i - left_count
                right_cost += right_count - (n - i - 1)
                left_count += 1
                right_count += 1
        
        print(min(left_cost, right_cost))
```

This corrected function calculates the minimum cost of moving all chips to either the leftmost or rightmost position of the existing chips and prints the minimum of the two.
