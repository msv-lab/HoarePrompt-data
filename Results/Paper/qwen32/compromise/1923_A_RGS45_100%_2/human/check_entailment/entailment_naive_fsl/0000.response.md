Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. Let's analyze why:

The given program calculates the number of zeros between the first and last '1' in the string, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The correct approach involves calculating the cost of moving all chips to either the leftmost or rightmost position of the existing chips.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Operations**: The program simply counts the zeros between the first and last '1'. This does not account for the fact that moving chips to the leftmost or rightmost position of the existing chips may require fewer moves.

2. **Example Case**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   5
   1 0 1 0 1
   ```
   - The program would find the first '1' at index 0 and the last '1' at index 4.
   - It would then consider the substring `10101` and count the zeros between the first and last '1', which is 2.
   - However, the correct answer is 2, but the program's method of counting zeros does not ensure the minimum operations in all cases.

3. **Another Example Case**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   5
   1 0 0 0 1
   ```
   - The program would find the first '1' at index 0 and the last '1' at index 4.
   - It would then consider the substring `10001` and count the zeros between the first and last '1', which is 3.
   - However, the correct answer is 2, as you can move one chip to the left of the other chip in two operations.

Therefore, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations in all cases. A correct approach would involve calculating the cost of moving all chips to the leftmost or rightmost position of the existing chips and choosing the minimum of the two.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        left_cost = 0
        right_cost = 0
        left_count = 0
        right_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == 1:
                left_cost += i - left_count
                right_cost += right_count - (n - i - 1)
                left_count += 1
                right_count += 1
        
        print(min(left_cost, right_cost))
```

This corrected function calculates the minimum cost of moving all chips to either the leftmost or rightmost position of the existing chips and prints the minimum of the two.
