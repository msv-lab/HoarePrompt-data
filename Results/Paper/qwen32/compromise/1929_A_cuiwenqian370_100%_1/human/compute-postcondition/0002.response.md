Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n where 2 <= n <= 100 and each integer a_i in array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings, each string representing an integer from the input; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first string in `data`.**

Natural language: The variable `t` is now assigned the integer value of the first string in the `data` list. The other variables, `array` and `data`, remain unchanged.
