The given loop only iterates over the `results` list and prints each `result`. It does not modify any of the variables `array`, `data`, `t`, `index`, or `results` within its body. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged after the loop completes.

Here's the output state:

Output State: **array is the last array processed in the final iteration of the loop; data remains unchanged; t remains unchanged; index is the position after the last processed part of data; results contains the results of func_1(array) for each iteration.**
