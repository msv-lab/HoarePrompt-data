You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

    func_2()

    array.sort()

    #The program returns the value of 'beauty', which is calculated as the difference between the last element (array[n-1]) and the first element (array[0]) of the sorted list 'array'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array. The beauty can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

Given that the beauty is the sum of differences, to maximize this sum, we need to arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending or descending order, as the absolute differences will be maximized between the smallest and largest elements.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(array)`**:
   - This function takes an array as input, sorts it, and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences are maximized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the beauty.
   
2. **`func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to compute the beauty for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
   - It stores the result of `func_1` for each test case and prints all results at the end.

### Correctness:
- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array in ascending order (or descending order) ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which is the key to maximizing the beauty.
- **Processing Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and storing the results.
- **Output**: The results for each test case are printed in the correct order.

Given that the logic of sorting the array to maximize the beauty is correct and the input/output handling is appropriately implemented, the program should work as intended for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
