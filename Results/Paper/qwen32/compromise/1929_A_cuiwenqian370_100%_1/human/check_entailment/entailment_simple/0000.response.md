### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any way. The key insight is that the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in either ascending or descending order. This is because sorting ensures the largest possible differences between consecutive elements, thereby maximizing the sum of these differences.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - **Sorting**: The array is sorted, which aligns with the insight that sorting the array maximizes the beauty.
   - **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty is calculated by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, the absolute difference is simply the difference between consecutive elements.
   - **Return Value**: The function correctly returns the calculated beauty.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Input Reading**: The function reads input from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming problems.
   - **Test Case Processing**: It processes multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - **Result Calculation**: For each test case, it calls `func_1(array)` to calculate the beauty of the array and stores the result.
   - **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
