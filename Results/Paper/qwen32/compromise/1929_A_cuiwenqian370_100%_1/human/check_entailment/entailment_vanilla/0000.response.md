To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array. The beauty can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

Given that the beauty is the sum of differences, to maximize this sum, we need to arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending or descending order, as the absolute differences will be maximized between the smallest and largest elements.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(array)`**:
   - This function takes an array as input, sorts it, and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences are maximized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the beauty.
   
2. **`func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to compute the beauty for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
   - It stores the result of `func_1` for each test case and prints all results at the end.

### Correctness:
- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array in ascending order (or descending order) ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which is the key to maximizing the beauty.
- **Processing Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and storing the results.
- **Output**: The results for each test case are printed in the correct order.

Given that the logic of sorting the array to maximize the beauty is correct and the input/output handling is appropriately implemented, the program should work as intended for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
