The code snippet provided initializes a list `b` with two elements, both set to 0. No other variables are modified or used in the snippet. Therefore, the only change in the state is the introduction of the list `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n+2` integers where -1000000000.0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 2000000000.0; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each of the `m` queries, there are two integers `x_i` and `y_i` such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n+2 and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer; `b` is a list containing two zeros.**
