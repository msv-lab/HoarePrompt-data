The `while` loop in this case is `while u:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the variable `u` is `True`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- The list remains `[0, 0, S_1, S_1, S_2, S_2, ..., S_{n-2}, S_{n-2}]`
- `u` is `False`
- `c` is the first value returned by `r()`, and `d` is the second value returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

Since the loop condition is `while u:`, the loop will only execute if `u` is `True`. At the end of the previous iteration, `u` is `False`, so no further iterations will occur unless `u` is changed to `True`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to change `u` to `True`.

State: **The list remains [0, 0, S_1, S_1, S_2, S_2, ..., S_{n-2}, S_{n-2}]; `u` is True; `c` is the first value returned by `r()`, and `d` is the second value returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
