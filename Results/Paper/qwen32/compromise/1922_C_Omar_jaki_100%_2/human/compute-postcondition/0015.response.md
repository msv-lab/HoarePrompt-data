Let's analyze the given code snippet and determine the changes to the variables.

The initial state provides us with:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n+2` integers where -1000000000.0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 2000000000.0.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
- `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.
- `b` is a list containing `[0, 0, v, v]`.
- `v` is `y - x`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Here’s what happens:
- `b[-2]` refers to the third last element of `b`, which is `v`.
- `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is also `v`.
- The expression `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is True (which means `v > x - w`), otherwise it evaluates to `1` (since any number to the power of 0 is 1).
- Similarly, `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is True, otherwise it evaluates to `1`.

Thus, the new elements added to `b` are:
- `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)` → `v + v ** (v > x - w)`
- `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` → `v + v ** (v > z - y)`

Therefore, the updated `b` list will be:
`[0, 0, v, v, v + v ** (v > x - w), v + v ** (v > z - y)]`

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `w`, `z`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n+2` integers where -1000000000.0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 2000000000.0; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer; `b` is a list containing `[0, 0, v, v, v + v ** (v > x - w), v + v ** (v > z - y)]`; `v` is `y - x`.**
