To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the code snippet provided.

The code reads multiple lines of input, where each line contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each set of integers, it performs the following operations:
1. It adds `c` to `b`.
2. It then evaluates the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` and prints the result.

Let's break down the expression:
- `-b // 3` is equivalent to `-(b // 3)`, which is the integer division of `b` by 3, negated.
- `c < b % 3` is a boolean expression that evaluates to `True` if `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3, and `False` otherwise.
- The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is a tuple indexing operation. If `c < b % 3` is `True`, it selects the second element of the tuple, which is `-1`. If `c < b % 3` is `False`, it selects the first element, which is `a - -b // 3`.

The loop processes each line of input independently and prints the result for that line. There is no accumulation of state between iterations, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are re-assigned for each iteration.

Given the initial state, where `t` is the number of test cases and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers for each test case, the output state will be a series of printed results, one for each test case.

The output state can be described as follows:
- For each test case, the code will print either `a - -b // 3` or `-1` based on the condition `c < b % 3`.

Since the output is a series of printed results and not a change in the state of the variables in the initial state, the output state in the requested format is:

Output State: **a series of printed results, one for each test case, where each result is either `a - -b // 3` or `-1` based on the condition `c < b % 3`.**
