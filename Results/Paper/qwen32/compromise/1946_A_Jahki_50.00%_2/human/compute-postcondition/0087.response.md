The given Python code snippet updates the value of `new_median` to be equal to `b[ma]`. Since `b` is already defined as the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, and `ma` is calculated based on the value of `num2`, the new value of `new_median` will be the value at index `ma` in the modified list `b`.

Given that `new_median` was previously `median - 1`, which is `b[ma] - 1`, it will now be updated to just `b[ma]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is 1; `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1; `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`; `median` is `b[ma] - 1`; `new_median` is `b[ma]`.**
