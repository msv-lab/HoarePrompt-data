Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`.
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `num2` is an input integer.
- `case` is the input string.
- `op` is set to 4.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 4.
- `median` is `b[ma]` before the last increment.
- `new_median` is `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is `median + 4`.

### Code Snippet:

```python
print(op)
```

### Analysis:

The code snippet only involves printing the variable `op`. According to the initial state, `op` is explicitly set to 4. There are no operations or conditions affecting `op` in the provided description.

### Conclusion:

The `print(op)` statement will output the value of `op`, which is 4.

Output: **4**
