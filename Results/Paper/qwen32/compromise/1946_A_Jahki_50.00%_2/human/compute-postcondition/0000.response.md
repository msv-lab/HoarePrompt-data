The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num`. This operation does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, or `a` as they are not referenced or modified in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` is an input integer.**
