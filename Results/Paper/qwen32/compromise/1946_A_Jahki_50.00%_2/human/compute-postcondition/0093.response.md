To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop condition. The loop condition is:

```python
while new_median <= median:
```

This means that for the loop to execute again, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`. Given the current state:

- `new_median` is `b[ma]`
- `median` is `b[ma] - 2`

For the loop to continue executing, `new_median` (which is `b[ma]`) must be less than or equal to `median` (which is `b[ma] - 2`). This condition cannot be true because `b[ma]` cannot be less than or equal to `b[ma] - 2`.

Therefore, to make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `median` to be greater than or equal to `new_median`. Since `new_median` is `b[ma]`, we need to adjust `median` to be less than `b[ma]`. The simplest way to do this is to set `median` to `b[ma] - 1`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is 2; `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 2; `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`; `median` is `b[ma] - 1`; `new_median` is `b[ma]`**
