Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `op` is 0; if `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `b` is the fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median > median`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the last increment, and `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is greater than `median`; `i` is incremented by 1; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a`. If `num2` is even, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. Otherwise, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**
