To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `new_median <= median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `median` is `b[ma]` before the increment.
- `new_median` is `b[ma]` before the increment.

Since `new_median` is set to `b[ma]` before the increment, and `median` is also set to `b[ma]` before the increment, the condition `new_median <= median` will always be true because they are equal. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `new_median` to be strictly greater than `median`.

Here's how we can adjust the states:

- We need to ensure that after the increment of `b[ma]`, `new_median` becomes greater than `median`.
- Since `new_median` is `b[ma]` after the increment, we need to make sure `b[ma]` (after increment) is greater than `median` (which is `b[ma]` before increment).

Thus, no other variables need to be adjusted except ensuring that `b[ma]` is incremented, which is already stated in the problem description. The only thing we need to explicitly state is that `new_median` should be greater than `median`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `op` is 1; `i` is incremented by 1; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1; `median` is `b[ma]` before the increment; `new_median` is `b[ma]` after the increment and must be greater than `median`**
