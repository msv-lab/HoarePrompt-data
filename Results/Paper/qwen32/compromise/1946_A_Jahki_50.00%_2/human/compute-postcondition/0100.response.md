Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is 0 if `num2` is greater than 10000, otherwise `op` is the number of iterations `k` until `b[ma]` becomes greater than the previous `median`; `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented `k` times if `num2` is not greater than 10000; `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is not greater than 10000; `median` is `b[ma] - k` if `num2` is not greater than 10000; `new_median` is `b[ma]` if `num2` is not greater than 10000.**
