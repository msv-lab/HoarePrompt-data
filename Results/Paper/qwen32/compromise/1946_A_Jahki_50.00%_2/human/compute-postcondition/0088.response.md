To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head:

```
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we know that the loop will continue to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4;
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5;
- `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`;
- `num` is greater than 0;
- `num2` is an input integer;
- `case` is the input string;
- `i` is `i + 1`;
- `op` is 1;
- `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1;
- `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`;
- `median` is `b[ma] - 1`;
- `new_median` is `b[ma]`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `new_median` and/or `median` such that `new_median <= median` holds true.

Since `new_median` is `b[ma]` and `median` is `b[ma] - 1`, the current state implies that `new_median` is exactly 1 greater than `median`. To satisfy the loop condition (`new_median <= median`), we need to adjust either `new_median` to be less than or equal to `median`, or adjust `median` to be greater than or equal to `new_median`.

However, since `new_median` is derived directly from `b[ma]` and `median` is derived from `b[ma] - 1`, the simplest adjustment would be to decrease `new_median` by 1 (or increase `median` by 1, but since `new_median` is directly dependent on `b[ma]`, adjusting `new_median` is more straightforward).

Therefore, we adjust `new_median` to be `b[ma] - 1`, which is the same as `median`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is 1; `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1; `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`; `median` is `b[ma] - 1`; `new_median` is `b[ma] - 1`**
