You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` is an integer representing the total number of intended iterations; `i` is equal to `num` if no `num2` exceeded 10000, otherwise it is the iteration count before breaking; `op` is the total number of increments performed across all iterations where `num2` was not greater than 10000; `num2` and `case` are the values from the last iteration; `b`, `ma`, `median`, and `new_median` are the values from the last iteration where `num2` was not greater than 10000.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
