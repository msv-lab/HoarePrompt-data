### Reasoning:

The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Handling of Large `n`:** The code includes a condition `if num2 > 10000:` which breaks the loop and prints hardcoded values. This is not a valid approach for solving the problem for all possible values of `n` up to \(10^5\).

2. **Median Calculation:** The code calculates the median correctly by sorting the array and selecting the appropriate element. However, the logic to increase the median is flawed.

3. **Increasing the Median:** The code attempts to increase the median by incrementing the middle element(s) until the new median is greater than the old one. However, this approach is inefficient and incorrect because:
   - It sorts the array after every increment, which is computationally expensive (\(O(n \log n)\)).
   - It only increments the middle element(s), but there might be more efficient ways to increase the median by incrementing other elements.

4. **Efficiency:** The code does not handle large inputs efficiently due to the repeated sorting and the way it tries to find the minimum number of operations.

### Correctness:

Given the above points, the provided code is incorrect for solving the problem as described. Therefore:

**Correctness: False**

A correct solution would involve a more efficient approach to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, possibly using a min-heap or a similar data structure to keep track of the smallest elements that need to be incremented.
