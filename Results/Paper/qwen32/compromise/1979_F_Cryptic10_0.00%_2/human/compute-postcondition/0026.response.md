The code snippet `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the element `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. Given the initial state, we know that `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0, and possibly excluding `v` if `v` was already not in `remaining_vertices`.

Here's the impact of the code:
- If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it will be removed, and `remaining_vertices` will no longer contain `v`.
- If `v` was not in `remaining_vertices`, the set `remaining_vertices` will remain unchanged.

Since the initial state specifies that `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 and possibly excluding `v`, after executing `remaining_vertices.remove(v)`, `remaining_vertices` will be a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 and `v`.

The values of `n`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `v` is the first return value of `func_1(d)` and `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`; `d` is 0; `path` is now `[0, v, v]` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` initially, otherwise `path` is `[v, v]`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 and `v`.**
