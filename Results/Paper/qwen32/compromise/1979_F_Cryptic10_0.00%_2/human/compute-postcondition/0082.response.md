Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged: if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the vertex `v` four times (with the additional `v` added at the end), and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the vertex `v` once, twice, or three times, and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, and `d` is `d - 1`. `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices`, while all other conditions and variables remain as described in the initial state.
