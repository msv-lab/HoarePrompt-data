The `while` loop continues as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v`.

To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `remaining_vertices` still contains at least one vertex. Since `v` was removed from `remaining_vertices` in the previous iteration, we need to add at least one vertex back to `remaining_vertices`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and at least one other vertex must be added back to `remaining_vertices`**.

To be more specific, if `v` was removed, we can add any vertex `u` (where `u` is not equal to `v` and `1 <= u <= n`) back to `remaining_vertices`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and one vertex `u` (where `u` is not equal to `v` and `1 <= u <= n`) is added back to `remaining_vertices`**.
