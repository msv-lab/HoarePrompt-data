To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `path` and `remaining_vertices` variables.

The loop continues to execute until `remaining_vertices` is empty. In each iteration, the loop attempts to find a vertex `v` in `remaining_vertices` by decrementing `d` from `n-1` to `0` and calling `func_1(d)`. If a valid `v` (non-zero and in `remaining_vertices`) is found, it is added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`. This process repeats until all vertices have been added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`.

Given this behavior, after all iterations, `remaining_vertices` will be empty, and `path` will contain all the vertices from the initial set in the order they were found and added to `path`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing all vertices from 1 to n in the order they were found and added to `path`; `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**

In simpler terms, `path` will have all the vertices from 1 to `n`, and `remaining_vertices` will be empty because all vertices have been processed and moved to `path`.
