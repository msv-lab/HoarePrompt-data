The code appends the value of `v` to the `path` list. Given the initial state, `path` is either `[0]` or `[]` depending on whether `v` was in `remaining_vertices`. After the code execution, `path` will be `[0, v]` if `path` was initially `[0]`, or `[v]` if `path` was initially `[]`.

Since `v` is the first return value of `func_1(1)`, and `d` is not modified by the code, the value of `d` remains 1. The values of `n`, `remaining_vertices`, and `u` are also not affected by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is `[v]` if `v` was not in `remaining_vertices` initially, otherwise `path` is `[0, v]`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to `n`; `v` is the first return value of `func_1(1)`; `u` is the second return value of `func_1(1)`; `d` is 1. If `v` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
