Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. If `v` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is now `[0, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 and `v`. If `v` was not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is now `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0. `v` is the first return value of `func_1(d)` and `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`. `d` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `v` is appended to the `path` list. If `v` was initially in `remaining_vertices`, `path` becomes `[0, v, v]`. If `v` was not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` becomes `[v, v]`. The state of `remaining_vertices` and other variables remains unchanged except for `path`.
