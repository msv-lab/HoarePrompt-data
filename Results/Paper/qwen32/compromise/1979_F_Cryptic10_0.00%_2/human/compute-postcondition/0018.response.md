Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is `[v]` if `v` was not in `remaining_vertices` initially, otherwise `path` is `[0, v]`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 and `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to `n`; `v` is the first return value of `func_1(1)`; `u` is the second return value of `func_1(1)`; `d` is 1. If `v` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the set `remaining_vertices` has had the value `v` removed from it, provided `v` is not 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
