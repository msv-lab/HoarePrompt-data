Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the state remains unchanged beyond the given postcondition of the if part.**
