The function `func_2` takes a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a graph (where 2 <= n <= 10^5) and prints a path of vertices from 1 to n in a specific order. The function does not return any value explicitly but outputs a string starting with '!' followed by the vertices in the order they were added to the path.
