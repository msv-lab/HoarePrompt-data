### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and verify if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for the given test cases.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Space for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b`, representing the number of 2x2 icons.
   - The program then calculates the number of screens required to accommodate these 2x2 icons.
     - If `b` is even, it divides `b` by 2 (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a screen has 15 cells, two 2x2 icons can fit in one screen if there is enough space for any remaining 1x1 icons).
     - If `b` is odd, it divides `b` by 2 and adds 1 (since one 2x2 icon will require a full screen or part of a screen, and the remaining 2x2 icon will need additional space).

3. **Calculating Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The variable `t1` calculates the remaining space available on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. This is computed as `t * 15 - b * 4`, where `t` is the number of screens used so far, and `b * 4` is the total cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means the remaining space is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons, and no additional screens are needed.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, it calculates the number of additional screens required to fit the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2 = a - t1`).
     - If `t2` is a multiple of 15, it adds `t2 // 15` to `t`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` to `t` to account for the partial screen needed.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1: (1, 1)**
   - `b` is 1, so `t` becomes 1 (one 2x2 icon needs one screen).
   - `t1` is `1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`, which is greater than `a` (1), so no additional screens are needed.
   - Output: 1

2. **Test Case 2: (7, 2)**
   - `b` is 2, so `t` becomes 1 (two 2x2 icons can fit in one screen).
   - `t1` is `1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`, which is equal to `a` (7), so no additional screens are needed.
   - Output: 1

3. **Test Case 3: (12, 4)**
   - `b` is 4, so `t` becomes 2 (four 2x2 icons need two screens).
   - `t1` is `2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 14`, which is less than `a` (12), so `t2` is `12 - 14 = -2` (which means no additional space is needed beyond the two screens).
   - Output: 2

4. **Test Case 4: (0, 3)**
   - `b` is 3, so `t` becomes 2 (three 2x2 icons need two screens).
   - `t1` is `2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`, which is greater than `a` (0), so no additional screens are needed.
   - Output: 2

5. **Test Case 5: (1, 0)**
   - `b` is 0, so `t` remains 0 (no 2x2 icons).
   - `t1` is `0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is less than `a` (1), so `t2` is `1 - 0 = 1`.
   - Since `t2` is not a multiple of 15, `t` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - Output: 1

6. **Test Case 6: (8, 1)**
   - `b` is 1, so `t` becomes 1 (one 2x2 icon needs one screen).
   - `t1` is `1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`, which is greater than `a` (8), so no additional screens are needed.
   - Output: 1

7. **Test Case 7: (0, 0)**
   - `b` is 0, so `t` remains 0 (no 2x2 icons).
   - `t1` is `0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is equal to `a` (0), so no additional screens are needed.
   - Output: 0

8. **Test Case 8: (2, 0)**
   - `b` is 0, so `t` remains 0 (no 2x2 icons).
   - `t1` is `0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is less than `a` (2), so `t2` is `2 - 0 = 2`.
   - Since `t2` is not a multiple of 15, `t` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - Output: 1

9. **Test Case 9: (15, 0)**
   - `b` is 0, so `t` remains 0 (no 2x2 icons).
   - `t1` is `0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is less than `a` (15), so `t2` is `15 - 0 = 15`.
   - Since `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - Output: 1

10. **Test Case 10: (8, 2)**
    - `b` is 2, so `t` becomes 1 (two 2x2 icons need one screen).
    - `t1` is `1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`, which is less than `a` (8), so `t2` is `8 - 7 = 1`.
    - Since `t2` is not a multiple of 15, `t` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
    - Output: 2

11. **Test Case 11: (0, 9)**
    - `b` is 9, so `t` becomes 5 (nine 2x2 icons need five screens).
    - `t1` is `5 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 21`, which is greater than `a` (0), so no additional screens are needed.
    - Output: 5

All the test cases match the expected outputs, indicating that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required for the given problem. Therefore,

Correctness: **True**
