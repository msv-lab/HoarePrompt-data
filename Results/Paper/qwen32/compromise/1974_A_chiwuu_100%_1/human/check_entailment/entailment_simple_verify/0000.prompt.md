You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and check whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Problem Statement Recap:
- We have a grid of size 5x3.
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
- Each screen can hold a maximum of 15 icons (5 rows * 3 columns).
- A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `t = b` is the number of 2x2 icons.
   - `t` is then adjusted to account for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. The calculation `t = b // 2` if `b` is even and `t = b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd is an attempt to find the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly account for the available space on the screens.

2. **Calculation for Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), then no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, the remaining `a - t1` 1x1 icons need to be placed on additional screens. The calculation `t2 = a - t1` finds the number of remaining 1x1 icons, and `t` is incremented based on how many additional screens are needed to fit these icons.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is incorrect. The formula `t = b // 2` if `b` is even and `t = b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd doesn't correctly account for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and needs to be placed on the grid.
- The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is also incorrect because `t * 15` represents the total cells available on `t` screens, but `b * 4` is the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons. The correct approach would be to calculate the number of screens needed based on the actual placement of the 2x2 icons and then calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

### Test Cases:
Let's consider the provided test cases to verify the correctness of the program:
1. **Input:**
   ```
   11
   1 1
   7 2
   12 4
   0 3
   1 0
   8 1
   0 0
   2 0
   15 0
   8 2
   0 9
   ```
2. **Expected Output:**
   ```
   1
   1
   2
   2
   1
   1
   0
   1
   1
   2
   5
   ```

Let's manually check the first few test cases:
- **Test Case 1: (1, 1)**
  - One 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells available.
  - One 1x1 icon can fit in the remaining 11 cells.
  - Expected Output: 1
  - Actual Output: 1 (Correct)

- **Test Case 2: (7, 2)**
  - Two 2x2 icons occupy 8 cells, leaving 7 cells available.
  - Seven 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining 7 cells.
  - Expected Output: 1
  - Actual Output: 1 (Correct)

- **Test Case 3: (12, 4)**
  - Four 2x2 icons occupy 16 cells, which means we need 2 screens to fit them (since each screen can hold 15 cells).
  - There are no remaining cells for 1x1 icons.
  - Expected Output: 2
  - Actual Output: 2 (Correct)

- **Test Case 4: (0, 3)**
  - Three 2x2 icons occupy 12 cells, which means we need 1 screen to fit them.
  - There are 3 cells remaining on the first screen, but no 1x1 icons to place.
  - Expected Output: 2
  - Actual Output: 2 (Correct)

- **Test Case 5: (1, 0)**
  - No 2x2 icons, so 1 screen is needed for the 1x1 icon.
  - Expected Output: 1
  - Actual Output: 1 (Correct)

- **Test Case 6: (8, 1)**
  - One 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells available.
  - Eight 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining 11 cells.
  - Expected Output: 1
  - Actual Output: 1 (Correct)

- **Test Case 7: (0, 0)**
  - No icons, so no screens are needed.
  - Expected Output: 0
  - Actual Output: 0 (Correct)

- **Test Case 8: (2, 0)**
  - No 2x2 icons, so 1 screen is needed for the 2x1 icons.
  - Expected Output: 1
  - Actual Output: 1 (Correct)

- **Test Case 9: (15, 0)**
  - No 2x2 icons, so 1 screen is needed for the 15x1 icons.
  - Expected Output: 1
  - Actual Output: 1 (Correct)

- **Test Case 10: (8, 2)**
  - Two 2x2 icons occupy 8 cells, leaving 7 cells available.
  - Eight 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining 7 cells.
  - Expected Output: 2
  - Actual Output: 2 (Correct)

- **Test Case 11: (0, 9)**
  - Nine 2x2 icons occupy 36 cells, which means we need 3 screens to fit them.
  - Expected Output: 5
  - Actual Output: 5 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to be working correctly for the given test cases. However, the logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is flawed and needs a more detailed and correct approach. But since the program passes all the given test cases, we can assume it is correct for those cases.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program seems to be working correctly for the provided test cases, but the logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is not robust and may fail for other edge cases. However, since it passes all the provided test cases, we can consider it correct for those cases.
