Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows x 3 columns).

### Key Points:
1. **2x2 Icons**: Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since the screen is 5x3, the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a screen is 3 (as placing 4 would exceed the screen size).
2. **1x1 Icons**: Remaining space after placing 2x2 icons is filled with 1x1 icons.
3. **Calculation**:
   - First, calculate how many screens are needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - Then, calculate the remaining space and determine how many screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program to see if it correctly implements this logic.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `n` is read.
   - For each test case, `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons) are read.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `t = b` initializes `t` with the number of 2x2 icons.
   - The code then calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons:
     - If `b` is even, `t = b // 2` (each screen can hold 2 2x2 icons).
     - If `b` is odd, `t = b // 2 + 1` (one extra screen is needed for the remaining 2x2 icon).

3. **Calculating Remaining Space**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` calculates the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1 >= a`, no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - Otherwise, `t2 = a - t1` calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
   - The program then calculates the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons:
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t = t + t2 // 15` (each screen can hold 15 1x1 icons).
     - Otherwise, `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` (one extra screen is needed for the remaining 1x1 icons).

### Correctness Evaluation:
The logic for calculating the number of screens for 2x2 icons seems incorrect. The code assumes that each screen can hold 2 2x2 icons, which is not true. As mentioned earlier, each screen can hold a maximum of 3 2x2 icons.

Let's correct the logic:
1. Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`t = (b + 2) // 3`).
2. Calculate the remaining space on these screens and determine how many additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        screens_for_2x2 = (b + 2) // 3  # Correct calculation for 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        if remaining_space >= a:
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2
        else:
            additional_screens = (a - remaining_space + 14) // 15  # Correct calculation for 1x1 icons
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)

# Call the function to execute the program
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
