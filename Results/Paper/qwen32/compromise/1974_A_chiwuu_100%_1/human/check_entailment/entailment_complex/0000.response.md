### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculation of Screens Needed for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - It then calculates the number of screens needed to place these 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and each screen has 15 cells, the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons alone is calculated as:
     - If `b % 2 == 0`, then `t = b // 2` (since two 2x2 icons can fit in one screen).
     - Otherwise, `t = b // 2 + 1` (since an odd number of 2x2 icons requires an additional screen).

3. **Calculation of Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The variable `t1` represents the remaining cells available on the screens already allocated for 2x2 icons. It is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons), no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, the program calculates the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons:
     - The number of additional cells needed is `t2 = a - t1`.
     - The number of additional screens required is calculated as `t2 // 15` if `t2` is perfectly divisible by 15, otherwise `t2 // 15 + 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Correctness:

The logic of the program is correct for the problem described. The program properly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons and then determines if additional screens are required for the 1x1 icons. The calculations for the number of screens are based on the available space on the grid and the constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
