The code snippet only initializes a variable `start_year` to 0. It does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`). Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `start_year` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0 and is decreased by 1; For each test case, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `start_year` is 0.**
