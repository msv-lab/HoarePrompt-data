To determine the output of the `print(start_year)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the initial state.

1. **num_tests** is initialized to 0.
2. **n** is an input integer, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state.
3. **nums** is a list of integers obtained from a new input line, so the exact values of the integers in this list are not provided.
4. **start_year** is defined as the least common multiple (LCM) of all the numbers in the `nums` list.
5. **x** is defined as `len(nums) - 1`, but it is not used in the print statement.

Since the exact values of the integers in the `nums` list are not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe what `start_year` represents.

The `start_year` is the least common multiple of all the numbers in the `nums` list. Therefore, the print statement will output this calculated LCM value.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the least common multiple of all the numbers in the `nums` list)**
