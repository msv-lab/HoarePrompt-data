The only variable in the loop head is `x`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is less than the length of the list `nums`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line and must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is `(nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 2**
