The `while` loop in the provided code snippet is:

```python
while num_tests > 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `num_tests` is greater than 0. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `num_tests` is greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `num_tests` so that it remains greater than 0. Since we are only allowed to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we will adjust `num_tests` accordingly.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0 after the current iteration.

### Adjustment:
- If `num_tests` is currently 0 or less, we need to adjust it to be greater than 0.
- If `num_tests` is already greater than 0, no adjustment is needed.

### Conclusion:
Since we need to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we should set `num_tests` to a value greater than 0. The simplest adjustment would be to set `num_tests` to 1.

State: **`num_tests` is 1**
