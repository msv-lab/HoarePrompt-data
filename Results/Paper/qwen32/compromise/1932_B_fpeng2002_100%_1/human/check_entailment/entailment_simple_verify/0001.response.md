### Reasoning

The original assessment has carefully analyzed the problem and the provided program. It breaks down the logic of the program step-by-step and verifies it against the example inputs given in the problem description. The reasoning provided is thorough and checks the correctness of the program for multiple test cases.

Let's go through the annotations and the code again to ensure everything aligns:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the starting point for the first sign.
2. **Loop through each sign**: For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year by using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula ensures that the next occurrence is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.
3. **Updating `start_year`**: After calculating the next occurrence for the current sign, `start_year` is updated to this new value, which becomes the starting point for the next sign.

The annotations and the original assessment both indicate that the program correctly computes the year for each sign to occur sequentially. The example calculations match the expected outputs, confirming the program's logic.

### Verification with Annotations

Let's re-examine the annotations for the first test case:

- **First Test Case**:
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - For the first sign (period 3): `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - For the second sign (period 2): `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - For the third sign (period 4): `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - For the fourth sign (period 5): `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - For the fifth sign (period 9): `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - For the sixth sign (period 18): `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The annotations confirm the correct sequence of calculations, leading to the final output of 36, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion

Given the thorough analysis and verification, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case.

**Final: True**
