To determine the output state, we need to understand what the functions `func_10()` and `func_14()` return. Since the exact implementations of these functions are not provided, we'll assume hypothetical return values for the sake of explanation.

Let's assume:
- `func_10()` returns `3`, meaning the loop will iterate 3 times.
- `func_14()` returns a different integer in each iteration, for example, `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively.

Given these assumptions, the loop will execute as follows:
1. In the first iteration, `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` will print `1\n`.
2. In the second iteration, it will print `2\n`.
3. In the third iteration, it will print `3\n`.

Thus, the output of the loop will be:
```
1
2
3
```

Output State: **The loop has executed 3 times, printing the numbers 1, 2, and 3 each on a new line. The state of variables not involved in the loop remains unchanged.**
