Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, and they satisfy the conditions 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n; `b` is the binary string representation of `n`; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 1; `ans` is an empty list.**

The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and `bk` remain unchanged. A new variable `ans` is introduced and initialized as an empty list.
