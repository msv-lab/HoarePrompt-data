The function `func_12` calculates a rank for a given integer `da` based on a dictionary `d` and a list `processing`. It returns `1` if the list associated with `da` in `d` contains only one element. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the minimum rank for all elements in the list `d[da]` and sets the rank of `da` to this minimum rank plus one. The function modifies the `rank` list in place to store the calculated rank for `da`.
