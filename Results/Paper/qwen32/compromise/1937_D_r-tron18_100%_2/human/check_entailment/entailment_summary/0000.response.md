### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem as described.

The problem requires us to determine how many seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position on the grid. The grid is represented by a string consisting of '<' and '>' characters, where '<' indicates movement to the left and '>' indicates movement to the right. After each movement, the direction of the cell is inverted.

The code is divided into two functions:

1. **`func_1(arr, times)`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function calculates the difference between the last element of the list `arr` and an element at a specific index based on the `times` parameter.
   - **Output Hints**: It returns the difference between the last element and the element at index `-1 - times` if `times` is negative. If `times` is `0` or positive, it returns `0`.
   - **Usage**: The function seems to be used to compute differences in cumulative sums for certain indices, which is useful for determining the effect of reversing directions on the pinball's movement.

2. **`func_2(s1, n)`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function processes the string `s1` and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - **Output Hints**: It calculates a list `ans` of values based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1` and prints the list.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Initialization**: It initializes several lists and variables, including `pre` (positions of '>' characters), `totalOne` (count of '>' characters), and `preOne` (cumulative sum of positions of '>' characters).
     - **Reverse Iteration**: It iterates over the string `s1` in reverse order.
     - **Condition Checks**: For each character, it checks if it is '>' or '<' and computes the time for the pinball to leave the grid based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters.
     - **Cumulative Sum Adjustments**: It adjusts the cumulative sums (`preOne` and `suffZero`) based on the character encountered.
     - **Result Calculation**: It calculates the result for each position and stores it in the `ans` list.
     - **Output**: It prints the `ans` list.

### Verification:

To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that the logic in `func_2` correctly simulates the pinball's movement and calculates the time for each starting position. The use of cumulative sums and the `func_1` function to calculate differences in these sums is a sophisticated way to handle the problem efficiently, especially given the constraints.

The provided example inputs and outputs are consistent with the expected behavior of the code. The logic in `func_2` seems to correctly handle the inversion of directions and the calculation of the pinball's movement time.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided code and its functions appear to correctly solve the problem as described. The use of cumulative sums and the `func_1` function to compute differences efficiently supports the correctness of the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
