### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic and implementation of `func_2` and how it interacts with `func_1`.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Grid and Pinball Movement:**
   - The pinball moves based on the direction indicated by the character in the current cell.
   - After each move, the character in the moved cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid (either from the left or the right).

2. **Queries:**
   - For each cell `i` in the grid, determine how many seconds it takes for a pinball placed at that cell to leave the grid.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Initialization:**
  - `pre`: List of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
  - `totalOne`: Number of '>' characters in `s1`.
  - `preOne`: Cumulative sums of indices in `pre` (prefix sums).
  - `suffZero`: Cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters, starting with 0.
  - `ans`: List to store the answer for each cell.

- **Processing Each Cell:**
  - For each cell `i` from the end to the start (`n-1` to `0`):
    - If the character is `>`:
      - Calculate indices (`zeroInd` and `oneInd`) based on the number of '>' and '<' characters.
      - Update `ans[i]` using these indices.
      - Adjust `preOne` and `totalOne` accordingly.
    - If the character is '<':
      - Update `suffZero` with the current index.
      - Calculate indices (`zeroInd` and `oneInd`) based on the number of '>' and '<' characters.
      - Update `ans[i]` using these indices.

- **Final Output:**
  - The list `ans` is printed, which contains the number of seconds for each cell.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Purpose:**
  - `func_1` calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at a specific index based on `times`.
- **Logic:**
  - If `times` is negative, it computes `arr[-1] - arr[-1 - times]`.
  - If `times` is non-negative, it returns 0.

#### Verification:
- The logic in `func_2` seems to correctly handle the movement and inversion of characters based on the problem description.
- The use of prefix and suffix sums (`preOne` and `suffZero`) allows efficient calculation of the required indices for each cell.
- The handling of both '<' and '>' characters is consistent with the problem rules.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided code and the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The use of prefix and suffix sums, combined with the conditional logic in `func_2` and the helper function `func_1`, ensures that the program efficiently calculates the required output for each test case.
