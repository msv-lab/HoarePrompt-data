Reasoning: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. It then iterates `t` times, each time reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Checking Conditions**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case based on the input values.

The given program does not have any logical errors and correctly handles all possible cases as per the problem description. The variable `mn` is not used anywhere in the program and can be removed without affecting the functionality.

Correctness: **True**
