### Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or neither ("NONE") based on the given conditions:

- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if the condition is true.
- It checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if the condition is true.
- If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

The program correctly handles the logic for each of the three possible outcomes as described in the problem statement. The execution summary also confirms that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
