The given code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `q`. This affects `q`, but does not change the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c` as they are not mentioned in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `q` is an input integer; For each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.**
