To determine the output state after the given loop has finished executing, we need to carefully analyze the loop and the variables it modifies.

The loop iterates `mid` times (where `mid` is calculated as `(right - left) // 2`). During each iteration `i`, the loop performs the following operations:
1. Assigns `small_element + i` to `arr[left + i]`.
2. Assigns `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`.
- `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.

After the loop, the relevant changes will be:
- The first `mid` elements of `arr` starting from index `left` will be set to consecutive values starting from `small_element`.
- The first `mid` elements of `cliquess` starting from index `left` will all be set to `clique`.

The other variables (`right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the output state can be described as:
Output State: **`arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are set to `small_element`, `small_element + 1`, ..., `small_element + mid - 1` respectively; `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all set to `clique`; all other variables remain unchanged.**
