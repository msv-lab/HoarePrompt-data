To determine what will be printed by the `print(p1 - cur + p3)` statement, we need to understand the state of the variables and the conditions given in the initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`p1`, `p2`, `p3`**: These are integers read from the input.
2. **Sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd**: This means the sum of these three integers is not divisible by 2.
3. **`low`**: This is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
4. **`high`**: This is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and it must be at least `cur`.
5. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `cur` is less than `high`. Inside the loop, if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the loop is broken out of. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.

### Analysis:
- The loop modifies `cur` based on the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. This condition can be simplified to `p1 - cur <= p2 - p3 + cur`, or `p1 + p3 <= p2 + 2*cur`.
- The loop increments `cur` until the condition is met or `cur` reaches `high`.
- At the point where the loop breaks, `cur` will be such that `p1 + p3 > p2 + 2*cur` is no longer true, meaning `p1 + p3 <= p2 + 2*cur`.

### What is Printed:
- The `print(p1 - cur + p3)` statement is executed after the loop. At this point, `cur` is the value that satisfies `p1 + p3 <= p2 + 2*cur` for the first time.
- The expression `p1 - cur + p3` simplifies to `p1 + p3 - cur`.

### Output:
Since we don't have specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can't compute the exact numerical value, but we can describe the printed value precisely based on the conditions.

Output: **p1 + p3 - cur (where cur is the value that satisfies the condition p1 + p3 <= p2 + 2*cur for the first time)**
