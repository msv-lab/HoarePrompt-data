The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are mentioned as part of the state before the loop starts, but they are not directly related to the execution of the loop itself. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p_2` is greater than or equal to `p_1`, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p_3` is greater than or equal to `p_2`, `t` must be greater than 0**
