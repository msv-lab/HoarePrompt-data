Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `high` must be at least `cur + 1`. `cur` is incremented by 1.**

Natural language: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable relationships remain the same as in the initial state.
