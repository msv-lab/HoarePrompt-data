To determine the output of the `print(p1 + p2)` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

1. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
2. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
3. The value of `p3` remains unchanged regardless of whether `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Given these conditions, we know that `p1 + p2 + p3` is an odd number. The parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of three numbers depends on the parity of the individual numbers. For the sum of three numbers to be odd, there are two possible scenarios:
- Two numbers are even, and one number is odd.
- All three numbers are odd.

However, the specific values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `p1` and `p2`. But we can determine the parity of `p1 + p2` based on the parity of the sum `p1 + p2 + p3`.

Since `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd, and `p3` is unchanged, the parity of `p1 + p2` must be such that when added to `p3`, the result is odd. This means:
- If `p3` is even, `p1 + p2` must be odd.
- If `p3` is odd, `p1 + p2` must be even.

Without the specific values of `p1` and `p2`, we cannot provide the exact numerical value of `p1 + p2`. However, we can describe its value in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 is an integer such that p1 + p2 + p3 is odd)**
