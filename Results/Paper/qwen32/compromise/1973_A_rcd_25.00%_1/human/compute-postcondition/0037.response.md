Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.**

In simpler terms: The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. The variable `low` is assigned the smaller value between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. The variable `high` is assigned the larger value between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
