Let's break down the problem step by step using the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
2. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
3. `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
4. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
5. `high` must be at least `low + 1`.
6. If the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1`, and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

### Determining the Output:
The statement to be executed is:
```python
print(p1 - cur + p3)
```

Let's analyze the value of `cur`:
- `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` based on the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

We need to determine which value `cur` takes:
- If `p1 - low <= p2 - (p3 - low)`, then `cur` remains `low`.
- Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1`.

### Calculating `low`:
- `low = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`

### Calculating `p1 - cur + p3`:
- If `cur = low`, then `p1 - cur + p3 = p1 - low + p3`.
- If `cur = low + 1`, then `p1 - cur + p3 = p1 - (low + 1) + p3 = p1 - low + p3 - 1`.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `low`. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The output will be either `p1 - low + p3` or `p1 - low + p3 - 1` depending on whether `cur` is `low` or `low + 1`.

Output: **p1 - low + p3 (where low is min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2) and cur is either low or low + 1 based on the condition p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur))**
