The value of `cur` is assigned the value of `low`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still odd.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`.**
