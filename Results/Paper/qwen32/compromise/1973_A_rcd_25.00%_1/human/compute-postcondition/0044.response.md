Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low + 1`; `p1 - (low + 1)` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - (low + 1))`.**

In simple terms, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `low + 1`. All other conditions and variable relationships remain the same.
