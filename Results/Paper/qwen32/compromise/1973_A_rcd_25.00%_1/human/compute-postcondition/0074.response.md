Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` remains unchanged.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is determined based on the condition:
     - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` holds true, `cur` remains equal to `low`.
     - Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` can be simplified to `p1 - cur <= p2 - p3 + cur`, which further simplifies to `p1 + p3 <= p2 + 2*cur`.
   - If the condition is true, `cur` is set to `low`.
   - If the condition is false, `cur` is set to `low + 1`.

3. **Determine `cur`:**
   - If `p1 + p3 <= p2 + 2*low` holds true, `cur` is `low`.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is `low + 1`.

4. **Expression to be Printed:**
   - The expression to be printed is `p1 - cur + p3`.

5. **Substitute `cur` in the Expression:**
   - If `cur` is `low`, the expression becomes `p1 - low + p3`.
   - If `cur` is `low + 1`, the expression becomes `p1 - (low + 1) + p3`, which simplifies to `p1 - low + p3 - 1`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The final output will be either `p1 - low + p3` or `p1 - low + p3 - 1` depending on the condition.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these variables and the derived `low` value.

Output: **p1 - low + p3 or p1 - low + p3 - 1 (depending on whether p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur) holds true, where low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2)**
