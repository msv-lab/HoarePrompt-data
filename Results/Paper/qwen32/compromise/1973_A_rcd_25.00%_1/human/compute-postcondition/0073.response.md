To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which is `high` and `cur` in this case.

Given the conditions:
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` depending on the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
- The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`. Since `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`, we need to ensure that `cur` does not exceed `high`.

Given that `cur` is already set based on the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we need to ensure that `high` is at least `cur` to allow the loop to execute again. Since `high` is already defined as the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we just need to make sure that `cur` does not exceed this value.

Thus, no further adjustment is needed for `cur` and `high` as long as they satisfy the initial conditions. We just need to ensure that the relationship between `high` and `cur` holds true.

Therefore, the state can be repeated as is, since the conditions for the loop to execute again are already satisfied by the definition of `high` and `cur`.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` remains unchanged; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` holds true, `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`**.
