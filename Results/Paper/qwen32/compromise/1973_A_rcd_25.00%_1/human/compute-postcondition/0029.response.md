To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the conditions and the behavior of the loop.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2`
   - `low = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
   - `high = max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
   - `cur = low`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.

### Output States After Iterations

- **After 1 Iteration:**
  - `cur` remains `low` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` holds.
  - `cur` becomes `low + 1` if the condition does not hold.

- **After 2 Iterations:**
  - If the condition was not met in the first iteration, `cur` is now `low + 1`.
  - The loop continues, and `cur` increments by 1 if the condition is not met again.

- **After 3 Iterations:**
  - `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` initially.
  - If the condition is not met, `cur` increments by 1 each iteration.

### Determining the Final Output State

- The loop will continue until `high < cur` or the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met.
- If the condition is met at any point, the loop breaks and prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
- If the condition is never met, the loop will run until `cur` exceeds `high`, and the `else` clause will execute, printing `p3`.

### Conclusion

The final output state depends on whether the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met during any iteration:

- **If the condition is met:** The output will be `p1 - cur + p3` where `cur` is the value that satisfies the condition.
- **If the condition is never met:** The output will be `p3` after the loop completes all iterations.

Given the constraints and the behavior of the loop, the final output state is:

Output State: **p3** if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is never met during the loop iterations, or **p1 - cur + p3** if the condition is met at some `cur` value.

Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions, and considering the loop might not break early, the most definitive final state is when the loop completes:

Output State: **p3**
