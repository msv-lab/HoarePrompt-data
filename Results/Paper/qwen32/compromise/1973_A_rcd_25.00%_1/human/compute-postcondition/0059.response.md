The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. However, the code snippet does not alter the values of `p1`, `p2`, or `p3` in any way after assigning them. Therefore, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain the same as they were read from the input.

The initial state specifies that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and there is a condition about `p3` being greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, but this condition does not affect the code snippet provided. The condition is mentioned but not utilized in the given code.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the value of `p3` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the value of `p3` remains unchanged.**
