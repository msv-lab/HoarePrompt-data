Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. The value of `p3` remains unchanged regardless of whether `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part.**
