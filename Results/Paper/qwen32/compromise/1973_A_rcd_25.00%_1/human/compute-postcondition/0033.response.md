The given initial state describes the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` as integers, and provides a condition that the sum of these integers is odd. Additionally, there is a conditional statement about the value of `p3` relative to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, but this condition does not affect the `print` statement in the provided code snippet.

The code snippet contains a single `print` statement:
```python
print(-1)
```
This statement will print the integer `-1`, regardless of the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Output: **-1**
