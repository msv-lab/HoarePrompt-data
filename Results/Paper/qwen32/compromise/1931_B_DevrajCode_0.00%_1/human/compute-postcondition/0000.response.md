The code calculates the sum of the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `total_water`. Since the sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n` (as per the precondition), `total_water` will hold this sum.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`.**
