The code snippet initializes a new variable `container` to 0. This does not affect any of the previously mentioned variables `n`, `a`, `total_water`, or `target`. Therefore, the output state retains the same values for `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target`, with the addition of `container` being 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`, and `total_water % n` equals 0. `target` is `total_water // n`. `container` is 0.**
