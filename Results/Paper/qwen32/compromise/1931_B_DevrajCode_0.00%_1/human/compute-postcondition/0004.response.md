The code calculates the `target` by dividing `total_water` by `n`. Since `total_water` is the sum of the list `a` and is divisible by `n`, `target` will be an integer representing the average value of the elements in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`, and `total_water % n` equals 0. `target` is `total_water // n`.**
