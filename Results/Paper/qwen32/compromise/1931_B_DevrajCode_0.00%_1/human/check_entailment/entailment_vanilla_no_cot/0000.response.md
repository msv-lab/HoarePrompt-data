Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a structure issue and a logical error. The main issues are:

1. The `func_1` function is defined after it is called, which will result in a `NameError`.
2. The program is not handling multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'NO'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Version:
- The `func_1` function is defined before it is used.
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.
- It then calls `func_1` to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
