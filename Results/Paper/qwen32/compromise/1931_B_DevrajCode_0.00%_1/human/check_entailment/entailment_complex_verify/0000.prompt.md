You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`, and `total_water % n` equals 0.
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: container is 0.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns the string 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if it is possible to redistribute the water in the list `a` among `n` containers such that each container ends up with the same amount of water, which is the average of the total water. It returns 'Yes' if such redistribution is possible without any container having a negative amount of water at any point during the redistribution; otherwise, it returns 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for certain edge cases. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function Call**: The program tries to call `func_1(n, a)` before defining the function `func_1`. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and then tries to process it. However, it does not correctly handle multiple test cases. The program assumes that all the input is for a single test case, which is not the case as per the problem description.

3. **Logic for Checking Water Distribution**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It checks if the cumulative difference between the current water level and the target water level ever goes negative. This does not correctly determine if it's possible to redistribute the water as required. 

Let's provide a counterexample to illustrate the issue with the logic:

Consider the following test case:
```
2
3
1 2 3
3
3 2 1
```

The correct output should be:
```
YES
YES
```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
NO
```

This is because the program's logic does not correctly account for the possibility of redistributing water between containers. The key issue is that the program does not consider the possibility of pouring water from a container with more water to a container with less water in a way that allows all containers to eventually have the same amount of water.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that the logic correctly handles multiple test cases and correctly determines if it's possible to redistribute the water. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version reads the input correctly for multiple test cases and applies the logic properly.
