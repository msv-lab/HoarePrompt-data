Reasoning: 
The provided program is designed to determine if it is possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container ends up with the same amount of water by performing the specified operations. The key logic in the program is as follows:

1. Calculate the total amount of water and check if it is divisible by the number of containers `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n` for each test case, so this check is redundant in this specific context.

2. Determine the target amount of water each container should have after redistribution, which is the total water divided by `n`.

3. Iterate through the list of containers, keeping a running balance (`container`) of the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. If at any point the running balance becomes negative, it means that it is not possible to redistribute the water without violating the condition that water can only be poured from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`. In such a case, the function returns 'No'.

4. If the loop completes without the running balance going negative, it means that the water can be redistributed as required, and the function returns 'Yes'.

The logic is correct based on the problem constraints and operations allowed. The program correctly identifies whether the redistribution is possible by ensuring that no "backward" operations (pouring water into a container that has already reached the target amount) are needed.

Correctness: **True**
