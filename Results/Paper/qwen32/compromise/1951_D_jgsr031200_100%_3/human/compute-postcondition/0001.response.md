The given initial state describes that `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraint \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('YES')`, which means it will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, but this information is not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is a straightforward output of the string 'YES'.

Thus, the output of the code will be:

Output: **YES**
