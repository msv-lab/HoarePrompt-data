### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob wants to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins by setting up at most 60 stalls with different prices. Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the second stall, and so on.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Greediness**: Alice will buy from the cheapest stall first and move to the next more expensive stall.
2. **Constraints**: We have to use at most 60 stalls, and each stall can have a price between 1 and \(10^{18}\) coins per jewel.
3. **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

#### Example Walkthrough:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - Alice can buy 3 jewels at a price of 2 coins each, leaving her with 1 coin which is not enough to buy any more jewels.
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 6`, `k = 4`
  - It's impossible to set prices such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 255`, `k = 8`
  - Alice can buy 1 jewel at each price of 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, spending 255 coins in total and buying exactly 8 jewels.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues:
1. **Function Call Error**: The function `func_1(n, k)` is called without being defined.
2. **Logic Error**: The logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. It tries to determine if Alice can buy `k` jewels by setting up stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which doesn't guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
3. **General Approach**: The approach in the code does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we can use the following strategy:
- Use binary representation of `k` to determine the number of stalls.
- For each bit in the binary representation of `k` that is set to 1, set up a stall with a price that ensures Alice buys the corresponding number of jewels.
- The number of stalls will be at most 60 (since \(2^{60}\) is a very large number).

#### Correct Code Example:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        stalls = []
        remaining = k
        price = 1
        while remaining > 0:
            if remaining % 2 == 1:
                stalls.append(price)
            remaining //= 2
            price *= 2
        
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
