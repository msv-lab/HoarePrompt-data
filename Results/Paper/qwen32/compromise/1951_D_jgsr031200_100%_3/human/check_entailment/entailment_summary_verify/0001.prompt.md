You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It prints "YES" and additional information if it is possible to perform a series of operations such that the sum of the operations is at least `k`. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value (None).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob wants to make sure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins by setting up at most 60 stalls with different prices. Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the second stall, and so on.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Greediness**: Alice will buy from the cheapest stall first and move to the next more expensive stall.
2. **Constraints**: We have to use at most 60 stalls, and each stall can have a price between 1 and \(10^{18}\) coins per jewel.
3. **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

#### Example Walkthrough:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - Alice can buy 3 jewels at a price of 2 coins each, leaving her with 1 coin which is not enough to buy any more jewels.
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 6`, `k = 4`
  - It's impossible to set prices such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 255`, `k = 8`
  - Alice can buy 1 jewel at each price of 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, spending 255 coins in total and buying exactly 8 jewels.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues:
1. **Function Call Error**: The function `func_1(n, k)` is called without being defined.
2. **Logic Error**: The logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. It tries to determine if Alice can buy `k` jewels by setting up stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which doesn't guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
3. **General Approach**: The approach in the code does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we can use the following strategy:
- Use binary representation of `k` to determine the number of stalls.
- For each bit in the binary representation of `k` that is set to 1, set up a stall with a price that ensures Alice buys the corresponding number of jewels.
- The number of stalls will be at most 60 (since \(2^{60}\) is a very large number).

#### Correct Code Example:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        stalls = []
        remaining = k
        price = 1
        while remaining > 0:
            if remaining % 2 == 1:
                stalls.append(price)
            remaining //= 2
            price *= 2
        
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints.

Correctness: **False**
