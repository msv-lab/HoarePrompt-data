The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The code does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` as they are mentioned to be provided in the subsequent lines but not yet read or processed by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. `t` has been assigned the value of the input integer.**
