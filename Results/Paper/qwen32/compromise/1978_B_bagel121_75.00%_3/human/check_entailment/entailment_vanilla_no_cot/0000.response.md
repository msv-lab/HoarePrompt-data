Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The program calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Decision Making**:
   - If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` since it's not beneficial to use the promotion. The profit in this case is `n * a`.
   - Otherwise, Bob should use the promotion. To maximize profit, he should sell as many buns as possible at the modified price as long as the modified price is higher than the usual price. The number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price is determined by `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and that the price does not drop below the usual price `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`. This formula calculates the sum of prices from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two amounts.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total profit for each test case.

The logic appears to be correct based on the problem statement and the provided examples. The program handles edge cases such as when `a >= b` and when `b - a + 1` exceeds `n`.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
