Postcondition: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18; `sequence` is a list of integers representing the array to be found, with all elements in the range [-10^9, 10^9]; the current value of `number` is 0; a value representing the size of the generated sequence has been returned.**

Note: The if condition `(number == 0)` is contradictory to the precondition that specifies `2 <= number <= 10^18`. However, based on the given task, the postcondition should include the if condition's state.
