Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `row`, which is a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and a parameter `d`, which is an integer representing the maximum distance between supports. The function returns the updated value of `row[-1]`, which is calculated as `e[0] + row[-1] + 1`, where `e` is a tuple popped from `min_heap` that satisfies the condition `e[1] <= len(row) - (d + 3)`.**
