Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows`. `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the number of rows and columns in a grid, respectively. `k` is a positive integer representing the number of consecutive rows for building bridges such that 1 <= k <= n. `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports. `rows` is a 2D list of integers representing the depth of the river cells with dimensions n x m, and the first and last elements of each row in `rows` are 0. The function returns the maximum number of bridges that can be built under the given constraints.**
