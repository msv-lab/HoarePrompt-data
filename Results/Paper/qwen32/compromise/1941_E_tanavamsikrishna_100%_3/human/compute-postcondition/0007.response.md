The code appends the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k` of the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list. Given that `i` is initially 1, the sum of `costs[1]` to `costs[1 + k - 1]` (i.e., `costs[1]` to `costs[k]`) is calculated and added to `total_costs`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers with `n` being at least `k`; `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`; `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of `costs[1]` to `costs[k]`; `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms: The `total_costs` list now includes an additional element, which is the sum of the costs from the second row to the `(k+1)`-th row in the `costs` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
