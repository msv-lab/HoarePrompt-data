The code snippet initializes an empty list called `total_costs`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, or `costs`. The variable `total_costs` is simply created and set to an empty list.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers; `rows` is a 2D list of integers representing the depth of the river cells with dimensions `n` x `m`, where each row starts and ends with 0, and the intermediate values are the integers read from the input; `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is an empty list.**
