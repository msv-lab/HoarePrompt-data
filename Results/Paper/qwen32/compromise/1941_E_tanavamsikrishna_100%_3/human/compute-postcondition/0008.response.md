The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement, `i` starts at 0 and goes up to `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1` (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the end value). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
- The loop condition is `i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be 2.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, `total_costs`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers with `n` being at least `k`; `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`; `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of `costs[1]` to `costs[k]`; `i` is 2**
