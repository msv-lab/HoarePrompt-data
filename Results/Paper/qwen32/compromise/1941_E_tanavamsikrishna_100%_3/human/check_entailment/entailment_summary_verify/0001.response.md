### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
`func_1(row, d)` is supposed to calculate the minimal cost of installing supports in a single row such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed `d`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the function:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `row[0]` is set to 1, which correctly accounts for the cost of installing a support at the first column (river bank).
   - The first `d` elements are incremented by 2, but this is not the correct approach to handle the cost calculation for the constraints. The logic here seems flawed.

2. **Min-Heap Usage:**
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost up to a certain point in the row. However, the logic for maintaining the heap and ensuring that the distance between supports does not exceed `d` is not correctly implemented.
   - The function pops elements from the heap until it finds an element that is within the `d` distance constraint, but it does not correctly update the heap or the row costs.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
`func_2()` reads the input, processes each row using `func_1`, and then calculates the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

1. **Cost Calculation for Each Row:**
   - `costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]` calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`. Given the issues with `func_1`, these costs are likely incorrect.

2. **Summation and Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost. However, since the individual row costs are incorrect, the overall result is also incorrect.

### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:

```
1
3 5 2 2
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```

The correct output should be `6` by placing supports at positions (2, 2) and (3, 2) for the first row, and (1, 2) and (2, 2) for the second row. However, the provided program's logic in `func_1` does not correctly handle these constraints, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for the bridges. The main issues lie in the incorrect logic in `func_1` and the subsequent incorrect summation and minimum cost calculation in `func_2`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
