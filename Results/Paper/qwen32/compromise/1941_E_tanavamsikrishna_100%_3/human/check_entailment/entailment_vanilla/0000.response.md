To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. Let's break down the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Grid and Bridge Construction**:
   - The river is represented as an `n x m` grid with the first and last columns being the river banks (depth 0).
   - Rudolf needs to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
   - Each bridge must have supports installed at the first and last columns (river banks).
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost to install a support at cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for the `k` bridges.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
   - It initializes the first `d` cells of the row with costs.
   - It then uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost to install supports for the rest of the row, ensuring that the distance between supports does not exceed `d`.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell in the row, which represents the total cost of the bridge for that row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for each test case.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the program correctly implements the solution:

1. **Cost Calculation for a Single Row**:
   - The use of a min-heap in `func_1` ensures that the minimum cost to install supports is found efficiently.
   - The function correctly initializes the first `d` cells and iterates through the rest of the row, maintaining the distance constraint between supports.

2. **Total Cost Calculation for `k` Consecutive Rows**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It finds the minimum total cost among all possible sets and prints it.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows while adhering to the constraints.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**
