The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts. The state of `n` is not relevant to the execution of this loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. Given the constraint that `1 ≤ t ≤ 50`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50**
