The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. However, the code snippet only affects the variable `t` by reading a new value for it from the input. Therefore, the value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**
