Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters.
- A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- For each test case, print "YES" followed by the string if possible, otherwise print "NO".

### Provided Program Analysis:
Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
```

### Function Summary Recap:
- The function handles each test case by checking if `n` is even.
- If `n` is even, it constructs a string by repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times.
- If `n` is odd, it returns "NO".

### Original Assessment Recap:
- The assessment states that the program is incorrect because it incorrectly handles cases where `n` is odd.
- For `n = 1`, the correct output should be "YES" followed by a string like "MM", but the program outputs "NO".
- The assessment suggests a corrected version of the program that specifically handles `n = 1`.

### Evaluation:
1. **Handling Even `n`:**
   - When `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times.
   - For example, if `n = 6`, the string "AAABAACC" is generated, which has exactly 6 special characters (at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8).
   - This part of the program works correctly.

2. **Handling Odd `n`:**
   - When `n` is odd, the program currently returns "NO".
   - However, it is possible to construct a string with exactly one special character for `n = 1` (e.g., "MM").
   - For `n = 3`, a valid string could be "AABB", which has exactly 3 special characters (at positions 1, 2, and 3).
   - Thus, the program should handle odd `n` appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle odd values of `n` correctly. It should be able to generate a valid string for `n = 1` and other odd values of `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
