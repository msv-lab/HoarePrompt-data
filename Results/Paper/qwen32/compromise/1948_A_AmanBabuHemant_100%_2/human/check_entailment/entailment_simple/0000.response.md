### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters where exactly `n` characters are special.
   - A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

2. **Analyzing the Example:**
   - For `n = 6`, the string "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters.
   - For `n = 1`, there is no possible string.
   - For `n = 2`, the string "MM" has 2 special characters.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`.
   - If `n` is odd, the program correctly outputs "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in the described pattern.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times. This string will have exactly `n` special characters.
   - The program checks if the length of the constructed string is less than 200, which is unnecessary because the maximum length of the string is `150` (when `n = 50`).

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic is correct for both odd and even values of `n`.
   - The constructed string for even `n` will always have exactly `n` special characters.
   - The length check is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
