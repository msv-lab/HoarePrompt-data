The provided code snippet only initializes the variable `minn` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `mex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer input; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0.**
