You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr, x):

    return find_max(arr, 31)

#Function 2:
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
    else:
        return thing1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `find_max` calculates a value based on a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (where 0 <= bit <= 29). It recursively processes the list to determine the maximum value between the length of a derived list `new_arr` and the result of further recursive calls, ultimately returning an integer value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calls `find_max` with a fixed bit value of 31. However, the problem description does not specify that the maximum number of bits to consider is always 31. The value of `x` can be any number less than \(2^{30}\), meaning the maximum number of bits to consider should be based on the highest bit position in `x`, not a fixed 31.

2. **Function `find_max`**: The logic inside this function is intended to recursively split the array based on the current bit position and check if the XOR of segments can be combined within the constraint `x`. However, there are several issues:
   - The `xor` variable is used to accumulate the XOR of elements in the current segment. When a segment's XOR does not have the current bit set, it is added to `new_arr`, and `xor` is reset to 0. This is correct.
   - The variable `thing1` is used to handle the case when the final `xor` has the current bit set. However, the logic for `thing1` is incorrect. It should recursively call `find_max` with the remaining elements and the next bit position, but it incorrectly returns -1 if the final `xor` has the current bit set.
   - The final return statement incorrectly compares the results of two recursive calls without considering the constraint `x`. It should only return the maximum of the two results if the combined result does not exceed `x`.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
The provided code will likely return an incorrect result because the fixed bit value and incorrect handling of the `xor` value will lead to incorrect segment splits and results.

To fix the code, the following changes are needed:
- Determine the maximum bit position in `x` dynamically.
- Correctly handle the case when the final `xor` has the current bit set.
- Ensure the combined result does not exceed `x` when comparing results of recursive calls. 

Since the current implementation does not meet these requirements, the code is incorrect.
