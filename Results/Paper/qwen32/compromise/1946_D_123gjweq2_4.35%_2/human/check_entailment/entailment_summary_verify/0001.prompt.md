You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr, x):

    return find_max(arr, 31)

#Function 2:
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
    else:
        return thing1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `find_max` calculates a value based on a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (where 0 <= bit <= 29). It recursively processes the list to determine the maximum value between the length of a derived list `new_arr` and the result of further recursive calls, ultimately returning an integer value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to divide the array `a` into the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_k, r_k]` such that:
- `l_1 = 1` and `r_k = n`.
- `l_i <= r_i` for all `i` from `1` to `k`.
- `r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1}` for all `i` from `1` to `k - 1`.
- The bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of all segments is less than or equal to `x`.

The goal is to find the maximum `k` or return `-1` if no such `k` exists.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(arr, x)`: This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
2. `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`: This function recursively tries to split the array based on the current bit position.

#### Understanding `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`

- **Base Case**: If `bit == -1`, it returns the length of `cur_arr`. This means that if we've processed all bits (from the 30th bit down to the 0th bit), we return the number of segments found.
- **Recursive Case**:
  - It initializes `xor` to `0` and `new_arr` as an empty list.
  - It iterates through `cur_arr`, computing the cumulative XOR (`xor ^= i`).
  - If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is `0` (`if not xor >> bit & 1`), it appends `xor` to `new_arr` and resets `xor` to `0`.
  - After the loop, if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is `1` (`if xor >> bit & 1`), it sets `thing1` to `-1`. Otherwise, it recursively calls `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` and assigns the result to `thing1`.
  - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is `1` (`if x >> bit & 1`), it returns the maximum of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.
  - Otherwise, it returns `thing1`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Bitwise Operations**: The program incorrectly checks the `bit`-th bit of `xor` and `x` using `xor >> bit & 1` and `x >> bit & 1`, respectively. This is not the correct way to check a specific bit. Instead, it should use `(xor >> bit) & 1` and `(x >> bit) & 1`.
2. **Handling of `thing1`**: The variable `thing1` is set to `-1` if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is `1` after processing the array. However, this is not the correct way to determine the maximum number of segments. The program should handle the case where the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is `1` more carefully.
3. **Recursive Call Logic**: The logic for handling the recursive calls and the decision to return `max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))` or `thing1` is not correct. The program should ensure that it correctly splits the array and checks the bitwise OR of the cumulative XORs of the segments.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It contains several logical errors and incorrect bitwise operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
