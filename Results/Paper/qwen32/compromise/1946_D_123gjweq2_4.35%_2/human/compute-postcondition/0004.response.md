Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` <= 29, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `xor` has been initialized to 0. All other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, and `new_arr`) retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
