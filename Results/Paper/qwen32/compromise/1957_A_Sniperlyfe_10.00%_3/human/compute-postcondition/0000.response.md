The code snippet only initializes an empty dictionary `freq = {}`. This does not affect any other variables or values in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same except that the `freq` dictionary is now initialized.

Output State: **arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths; `freq` is an empty dictionary.**
