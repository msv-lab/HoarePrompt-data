The given code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Since `j` is defined as `x + 1`, the value being appended is `1 << (x + 1)`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer.
- `k` is unchanged.
- `i` is \(\lfloor \log_2(k) \rfloor\).
- `ans` is initially \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]\) if `j` equals `i`, otherwise `ans` is \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]\).
- `j` is `x + 1`.

After executing `ans.append(1 << j)`, the list `ans` will include an additional element `1 << (x + 1)`.

Therefore, the updated `ans` will be:
- If `j` was initially equal to `i`, `ans` becomes \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << (x + 1)]\).
- If `j` was not initially equal to `i`, `ans` becomes \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j, 1 << (x + 1)]\).

Since `j` is `x + 1`, the second case applies more generally, as the first condition is just a special case of the second where `j` happens to equal `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer; `k` is unchanged; `i` is \(\lfloor \log_2(k) \rfloor\); `ans` is \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j, 1 << (x + 1)]\); `j` is `x + 1`.**
