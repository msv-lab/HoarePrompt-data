Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a list of 21 integers based on the value of `k`. The list includes specific powers of 2 and values derived from `k`, ensuring that one particular power of 2 (determined by the highest power less than or equal to `k`) is excluded.**
