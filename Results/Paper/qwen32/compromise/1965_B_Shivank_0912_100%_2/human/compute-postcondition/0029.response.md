To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `1 << i + 1 <= k`.

Given:
- `i` is 0.
- The condition is `1 << i + 1 <= k`.

Let's break down the condition:
- `1 << i` is equivalent to `1 << 0`, which equals 1.
- Therefore, `1 << i + 1` becomes `1 + 1`, which equals 2.

So, the condition simplifies to `2 <= k`.

This means that for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 2.

Thus, the only state that needs adjustment is `k`. The other variables (`tc`, `n`, and the list) do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072], `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 0]**
