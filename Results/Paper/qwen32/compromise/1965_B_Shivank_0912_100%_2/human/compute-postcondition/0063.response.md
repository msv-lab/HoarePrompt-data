The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`, after appending `1 << j`, the new `ans` will be `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `n`, `k`, the list excluding \(2^i\), `tc`, `i`, and `j` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the list `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding \(2^i\) remains unchanged, `tc` is 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{(i + 1)} \leq k\), `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]`, `j` is not equal to `i`.**
