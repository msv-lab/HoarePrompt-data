To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop:

The loop condition is `while 1 << i + 1 <= k`. This condition checks if \(2^{(i+1)}\) is less than or equal to \(k\). The loop increments \(i\) by 1 in each iteration.

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can see that:
- After 1 iteration, \(i\) becomes 1, meaning \(k \geq 2\).
- After 2 iterations, \(i\) becomes 2, meaning \(k \geq 4\).
- After 3 iterations, \(i\) becomes 3, meaning \(k \geq 8\).

Following this pattern, the loop will continue to increment \(i\) until \(2^{(i+1)}\) exceeds \(k\). Therefore, the final value of \(i\) will be the largest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} \leq k\).

Let's denote the final value of \(i\) as \(i_{\text{final}}\). At the end of the loop, the condition \(1 << (i_{\text{final}} + 1) > k\) will hold true.

Thus, the final state of the variables will be:
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `k` remains the input integer.
- The list `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding \(2^i\) remains unchanged.
- `tc` remains 1.
- `i` will be \(i_{\text{final}}\), which is the largest integer such that \(2^{(i_{\text{final}} + 1)} \leq k\).

Therefore, the output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the list `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding \(2^i\) remains unchanged, `tc` is 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{(i + 1)} \leq k\).**
