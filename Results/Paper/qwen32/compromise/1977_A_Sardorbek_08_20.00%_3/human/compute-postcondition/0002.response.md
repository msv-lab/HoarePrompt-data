To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's break down the loop and its effects on the variables and the output:

The loop iterates `a` times, and in each iteration:
- It takes two integers `b` and `c` as input.
- It checks the following conditions in order:
  1. If `b` is equal to `c`, it prints 'YES'.
  2. If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'.
  3. If `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`, it prints 'Yes'.
  4. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

After each iteration, the values of `b`, `c`, and `q` are updated based on the new input, but they do not affect the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, or `a` outside the loop. The loop does not modify `t`, `n`, or `m` in any way.

Thus, the state of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remains unchanged. The only changes are the printed outputs for each iteration of the loop.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is an input integer. The loop has printed 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' for each of the `a` iterations based on the conditions specified.**
