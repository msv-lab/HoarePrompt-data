You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is an input integer. The loop has printed 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' for each of the `a` iterations based on the conditions specified.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. It then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's examine the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube from the tower per move. The task is to determine if it's possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Moves**: Nikita can either add or remove 1 cube per move.
3. **Parity**: Since each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either +1 or -1), the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes will change with each move.
4. **Final State**: After `n` moves, the number of cubes `m` must be reachable. This means:
   - If `n` is even, `m` must be even (since starting from 0, an even number of moves will result in an even number of cubes).
   - If `n` is odd, `m` must be odd (since starting from 0, an odd number of moves will result in an odd number of cubes).
5. **Range**: The number of cubes `m` cannot exceed `n` (since you can't have more cubes than the number of moves if you start from 0).

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.
2. **Condition Checks**:
   - The first condition `if b == c:` checks if the number of moves `n` equals the number of cubes `m`. This is not necessarily a correct condition for determining the possibility of having `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - The second condition `elif b < c:` checks if the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`. This is correct because you cannot have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The third condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. It seems to be checking the parity of the number of test cases `a` and the number of moves `b`, which is irrelevant. It should be checking the parity of `n` and `m`.
   - The last condition `else:` handles all other cases, but it’s not correctly structured due to the incorrect third condition.

### Correct Conditions:
- If `n` is less than `m`, print "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), print "YES".
- Otherwise, print "NO".

### Corrected Logic:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program has incorrect logic in the third condition and does not correctly handle the parity check between `n` and `m`. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
