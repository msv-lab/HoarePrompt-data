Reasoning:
Let's analyze the conditions in the code and see if they match the problem requirements.

The problem states that for each test case, we have two integers `n` and `m`, and we need to determine if it is possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move is either adding or removing a single cube.

The conditions in the code are as follows:
1. `if b == c:` This checks if the number of moves `b` is equal to the number of cubes `c`. This condition is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it means we can simply add one cube per move, and we will end up with `m` cubes.
2. `elif b < c:` This checks if the number of moves `b` is less than the number of cubes `c`. This condition is correct because if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, it is impossible to end up with `m` cubes, as we cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
3. `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` This condition is incorrect. Here, `a` is the number of test cases and should not be used in this context. The correct condition should be checking if the parity (even or odd nature) of `b` (number of moves) and `c` (number of cubes) is the same. This is because to end up with `m` cubes, the difference between `b` and `c` must be even (since each pair of add and remove operations results in no net change in the number of cubes).
4. `else:` This handles all other cases, which is correct in the sense that if the above conditions are not met, it should print 'No'.

The third condition is incorrect because it uses `a` (the number of test cases) instead of checking the parity of `b` and `c`. The correct condition should be `elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect condition.

Correctness: **False**
