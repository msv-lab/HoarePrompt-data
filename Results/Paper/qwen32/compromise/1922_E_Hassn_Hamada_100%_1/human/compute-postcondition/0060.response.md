The code appends the value of `i + overlap` to the `sequence` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 5 and `overlap` is 1, so the value `i + overlap` is `5 + 1 = 6`. Therefore, the `sequence` list, which initially contains the single element 5, will now contain the elements 5 and 6. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`size` is 6, `overlap` is 1, `i` is 5, `sequence` contains 5, 6**.
