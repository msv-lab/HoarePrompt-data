The provided code snippet contains only a `break` statement, which exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. This statement does not affect the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the values of `size`, `value`, and `size_overlap` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`size` is \(\lceil \log_2(number + (1 << i)) - 1 \rceil\), `value` is \(2^{\lceil \log_2(number + (1 << i)) - 1 \rceil} - (1 << i)\), `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing the current values of `size` and `i`.**
