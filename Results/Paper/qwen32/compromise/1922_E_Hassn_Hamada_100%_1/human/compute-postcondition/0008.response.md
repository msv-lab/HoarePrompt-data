The code snippet increments the value of `size` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `size` will be `i + 2` (since `size` was initially `i + 1`).

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 3 <= number <= 1000, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one integer where each integer X in `sequence` satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is `i + 2`, `value` is `2`**.
