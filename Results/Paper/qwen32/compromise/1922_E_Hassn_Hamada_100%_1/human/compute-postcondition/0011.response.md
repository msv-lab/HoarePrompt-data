Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 7 <= number <= 1000, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one integer where each integer X in `sequence` satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is 3, `i` is 0, `value` is 2**

The value of `size` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
