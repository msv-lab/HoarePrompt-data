The code modifies the `value` variable using a bitwise shift operation. Here's the calculation:
- `1 << size` shifts the number 1 to the left by `size` places, which is 4 in this case. This results in 16 (binary 10000).
- `1 << i` shifts the number 1 to the left by `i` places, which is 0 in this case. This results in 1 (binary 1).
- The expression then subtracts these two results: `16 - 1`, which equals 15.

Therefore, the `value` variable is updated to 15. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`number` must be at least 15, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one integer where each integer X in `sequence` satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is 4, `i` is 0, `value` is 15**.
