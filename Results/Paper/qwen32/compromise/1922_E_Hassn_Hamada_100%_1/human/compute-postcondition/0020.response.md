Postcondition: **`number` is an integer such that 1 <= number <= 1000, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one integer where each integer X in `sequence` satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18, `size` is 9, `i` is 0, `value` is 511. If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is (9, 0) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `size_overlap` remains (0, 0).**
