Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we can determine the new values of `size` and `value` after the code executes.

The code snippet is:
```python
size, value = i + 1, (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `max(sequence, default=0) - 1`
- `size` is initially 9 (though this will change)
- `value` is initially 511 (though this will change)

First, we need to determine the value of `i`:
- `i = max(sequence, default=0) - 1`
  - Since `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer \(X\) satisfies \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\), the maximum value in `sequence` will also be within this range.
  - Therefore, `i` will be the maximum value in `sequence` minus 1.

Next, we calculate the new `size` and `value`:
- `size = i + 1`
- `value = (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`

Let's simplify the expression for `value`:
- `value = (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`
- This can be rewritten as: `value = 2^(i + 1) - 2^i`
- Factoring out \(2^i\), we get: `value = 2^i * (2 - 1)`
- Thus, `value = 2^i`

So, after the code executes:
- `size` will be `max(sequence, default=0)`
- `value` will be `2^(max(sequence, default=0) - 1)`

Since the initial state specifies that `number` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{number} \leq 1000\) and `sequence` contains integers between 2 and \(10^{18}\), these conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{number} \leq 1000\), `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one integer where each integer \(X\) in `sequence` satisfies \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\), `size` is `max(sequence, default=0)`, `i` is `max(sequence, default=0) - 1`, `value` is \(2^{max(sequence, default=0) - 1}\)**
