To determine the state adjustments required for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i`, `max(sequence, default=0)`, and the range parameters.

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

1. **`max(sequence, default=0)`**: This expression determines the starting point of the loop. If `sequence` is empty, it defaults to 0. If `sequence` is not empty, it will be the maximum value in the list.
2. **`i`**: This is the loop variable that starts at `max(sequence, default=0)` and decrements to `-1`.

To ensure the loop executes, `max(sequence, default=0)` must be greater than or equal to 0. Since `max(sequence, default=0)` defaults to 0 when `sequence` is empty, the loop will execute if `sequence` is not empty and contains at least one integer.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `number` is an integer such that 1 <= number <= 1000.
- `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X in `sequence` satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18.
- `size_overlap` is (0, 0).

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `sequence` is not empty. If `sequence` is empty, `max(sequence, default=0)` will be 0, and the loop will not execute because the range will be `range(0, -1, -1)`, which is empty.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `sequence` has at least one integer.

State: **`number` is an integer such that 1 <= number <= 1000, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one integer where each integer X in `sequence` satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18, `size_overlap` is (0, 0)**
