Let's analyze the given situation step by step. 

The loop head in the provided code is `for i in range(size - overlap):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `size - overlap`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `size` is 6
- `overlap` is 1
- `i` is 4
- `sequence` contains 5 (though `sequence` is not part of the loop head, it's provided in the state, so we'll keep it for completeness)

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to:
1. Increment `i` by 1, because the loop increments `i` automatically.
2. Check if the new value of `i` is less than `size - overlap` to confirm if the loop will execute again.

Let's calculate:
- `size - overlap` is 6 - 1 = 5
- After the previous iteration, `i` was 4. So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4 + 1 = 5.

Now, we check if `i` (which is 5) is less than `size - overlap` (which is also 5). Since 5 is not less than 5, the loop will not execute again.

However, the task is to provide the state as if the loop were to execute one more time, so we'll assume the loop is about to start its next iteration with `i` incremented.

State: **`size` is 6, `overlap` is 1, `i` is 5, `sequence` contains 5**
