Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to generate an array of integers such that the array has exactly X increasing subsequences. However, there are several issues with the given code that make it incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` Return Statement**: The function `func_1` has a return statement `return 0, 0` which is never reached because it is placed after the `if (number == 0)` block. This return statement does not contribute to the logic of the function and can be removed.

2. **Incorrect State Handling**: The state comments and the logic inside the function `func_1` do not align with the problem description. The function is supposed to generate a sequence that results in exactly X increasing subsequences, but the current logic does not ensure this. The loop and the way `size` and `overlap` are calculated do not directly relate to generating an increasing subsequence count of X.

3. **Logical Errors in Sequence Generation**: The sequence generation logic is flawed. The function is supposed to append integers to the sequence in a way that results in exactly X increasing subsequences, but the current implementation does not guarantee this.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: The function does not handle boundary conditions properly. For example, if X is a power of 2, the function should generate a sequence with a specific pattern to achieve the exact count of increasing subsequences, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

5. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The function is supposed to print the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, but the current implementation does not handle the output format correctly, especially for the case where no such array exists (it should print -1).

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
