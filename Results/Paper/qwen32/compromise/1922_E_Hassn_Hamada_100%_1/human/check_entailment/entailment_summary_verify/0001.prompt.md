You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

        while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
            size += 1

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` between 1 and 1000 and a list of integers `sequence` where each integer is between 2 and \(10^{18}\). The function modifies the `sequence` list by appending additional integers based on the value of `number`. Regardless of the input, the function always returns the tuple (0, 0).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to find an array of integers such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. If no such array exists, output -1. Otherwise, output the length of the array and the array itself.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (which is actually `X` as per the problem statement).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of numbers that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - It calculates the size and value of the sequence based on the binary representation of `X - 1`.
   - The function appends elements to the `sequence` list based on the calculated size and overlap.

3. **Output**:
   - After generating the sequence, the program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n - 1` as the argument, which seems incorrect. The function is supposed to generate a sequence for `X` increasing subsequences, not `X - 1`.

2. **Incorrect Base Case**:
   - The base case of the function `func_1` returns `(0, 0)` when `number == 0`. However, the function is supposed to modify the `sequence` list, not return a tuple.

3. **Logic for Sequence Generation**:
   - The logic inside the function `func_1` seems to be based on generating binary representations and calculating the size of the sequence. However, this logic does not directly ensure that the generated sequence has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where it's impossible to find such an array. It should output `-1` in such cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for generating the sequence and ensuring the correct number of increasing subsequences is flawed, and the program does not handle all edge cases properly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
