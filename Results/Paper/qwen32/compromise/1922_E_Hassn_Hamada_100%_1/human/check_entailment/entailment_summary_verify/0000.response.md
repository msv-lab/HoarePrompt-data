### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` to determine if it correctly generates an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to create an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The sequence must be generated based on the number of subsequences required. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate this sequence.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence of integers based on the input `number` and modify the `sequence` list accordingly. The function summary provided states that the function always returns the tuple `(0, 0)`, but the actual return statement in the code is missing. The function modifies the `sequence` list by appending integers based on the value of `number`.

The function attempts to find the largest `size` and `overlap` such that the number of increasing subsequences generated by appending numbers to the sequence matches the given `number`. The logic involves binary shifting and bitwise operations to determine the size of the sequence and the elements to append.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Return Statement**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return `(0, 0)`, but there is no return statement in the code. This could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. **Appending Logic**: The logic for appending elements to the sequence seems flawed. The function attempts to append elements based on the calculated `size` and `overlap`, but it does not ensure that the resulting sequence has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
3. **Handling Large `X` Values**: The function uses bitwise operations to handle large values of `X`, but the logic might not be correct for all values of `X` within the given range (2 ≤ X ≤ 10¹⁸).

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the function with the example provided in the problem description:
- **Input:** `X = 5`
- **Expected Output:** An array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences, e.g., `[0, 1, 0]`.
- **Actual Output:** The function does not generate a correct sequence for this input.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all values of `X` within the given range. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to generate the required sequence.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
