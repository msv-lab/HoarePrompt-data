The code snippet provided assigns the list `vx` to `p1` and an empty list `[]` to `p2`. The variables `ops`, `vx`, `p1`, and `p2` are affected by this code. The values of `ops`, `vx`, and `p1` are updated, while `p2` is explicitly set to an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations; `ops` contains all the operations performed during the loop; `p1` is a copy of `vx`; `p2` is an empty list.**
