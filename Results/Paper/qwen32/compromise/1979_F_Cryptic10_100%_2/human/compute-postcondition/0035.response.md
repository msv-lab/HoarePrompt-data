The only variables in the loop head are `v1` and `v2`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops` list. If there are more elements in `ops`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `(v1, v2)` are the last elements of the `ops` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `ops` before the current `(v1, v2)`.

Since the loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, it processes the elements of `ops` in reverse order. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `(v1, v2)` should be the next element in the reversed `ops` list.

Let's assume the current `(v1, v2)` at the end of the previous iteration was the second last element in `ops`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `(v1, v2)` should be the last element in `ops` before the current one.

State: **`p1` and `p2` are as they are at the end of the previous iteration except that if `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` has `v1` appended to it; otherwise, `p1` has `v1` appended to it. `(v1, v2)` is the next element in `ops` before the current one.**

To make this more concrete, let's say the current `(v1, v2)` at the end of the previous iteration was `(ops[-2][0], ops[-2][1])`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `(v1, v2)` should be `(ops[-1][0], ops[-1][1])`.

State: **`p1` and `p2` are as they are at the end of the previous iteration except that if `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` has `v1` appended to it; otherwise, `p1` has `v1` appended to it. `(v1, v2)` is `(ops[-1][0], ops[-1][1])`.**

However, since we don't have the specific values of `ops`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`p1` and `p2` are as they are at the end of the previous iteration except that if `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` has `v1` appended to it; otherwise, `p1` has `v1` appended to it. `(v1, v2)` is the next element in `ops` when iterating in reverse order.**
