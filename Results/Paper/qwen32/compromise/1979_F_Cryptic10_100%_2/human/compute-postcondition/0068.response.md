Output State: **`vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers; `ops` is a list of tuples representing operations; `p1` contains the two integers from `vx` and `p2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns `p1` the list representation of the set `vx`, which means `p1` will contain exactly the two integers that were in the set `vx`. The variable `p2` is explicitly set to an empty list. The other variables, `ops`, `v1`, and `v2`, remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.
