Output State: **`vx` has one less element, specifically `v1` has been removed; `ops`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged; `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`; if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)`**

In natural language: The list `vx` now has one less element because `v1` has been removed. The other variables `ops`, `p1`, and `p2` have not been altered. The values of `v1` and `v2` are still the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` remains the first return value of `q(0)`.
