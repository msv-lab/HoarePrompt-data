The code snippet appends `v1` to either `p1` or `p2`, depending on whether the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. If `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, then `p2` is appended with `v1`. Otherwise, `p1` is appended with `v1`. The values of `vx`, `ops`, `v1`, and `v2` are not affected directly by the append operation, but the state of either `p1` or `p2` will change.

Output State: **`vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations; `ops` is a list with at least two tuples; `v1` is `v1_next`; `v2` is `v2_next`; `p1` is `p1` with `v1` appended if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is `p2` with `v1` appended.**
