The given code snippet modifies either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. If the condition is true, `v1` is appended to `p2`; otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

Given the initial state:
- `vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations.
- `ops` is a list with at least one tuple `(v1, v2)`.
- `p1` is a copy of `vx`.
- `p2` is an empty list.

Let's break down the code:
- The condition `p1[-1] == v2` checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`.
- If the condition is true, `v1` is appended to `p2`.
- If the condition is false, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

Since `p1` is a copy of `vx`, the last element of `p1` is the same as the last element of `vx`. The state of `p2` is initially empty.

The output state will depend on whether `p1[-1]` (which is the same as `vx[-1]`) is equal to `v2`:
- If `vx[-1] == v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`, making `p2` contain `v1`.
- If `vx[-1] != v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p1`, making `p1` contain the original elements of `vx` plus `v1`.

Since the exact values of `v1`, `v2`, and `vx` are not provided, we can't determine the specific values of `p1` or `p2` after the operation. However, we can describe the possible states based on the condition.

Output State: **`vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations; `ops` is a list with at least one tuple (v1, v2); if `vx[-1] == v2`, then `p1` remains the same as `vx` and `p2` becomes `[v1]`; otherwise, `p1` becomes `vx` with `v1` appended to it and `p2` remains an empty list.**
