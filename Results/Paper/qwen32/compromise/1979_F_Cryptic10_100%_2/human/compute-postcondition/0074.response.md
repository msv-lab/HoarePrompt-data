The given code snippet is:
```python
(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
```

Given the Initial State:
- `vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers.
- `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(a, b, a)` where `a` and `b` are the initial elements of the tuple in `ops`.

From the tuple `(a, b, a)` in `ops`, we can deduce:
- `p1` refers to the first element of the tuple, which is `a`.
- `p2` refers to the second element of the tuple, which is `b`.
- `v1` is the first element of the tuple, which is `a`.
- `v2` is the third element of the tuple, which is `a`.

The code snippet checks if the last element of `p1` (which is `a`) is equal to `v2` (which is also `a`). Since they are equal, `p2` (which is `b`) will be used. The `append` method is then called on `p2` with the argument `v1` (which is `a`).

Thus, the element `a` is appended to `p2`.

Given that `vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers and `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(a, b, a)`, after the execution of the code, the set `vx` remains unchanged, but `ops` will be modified because `b` (which is `p2`) has been updated by appending `a` to it.

Output State: **`vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers; `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(a, [b, a], a)` where `a` and `b` are the initial elements of the tuple in `ops`.**
