Let's analyze the given code snippet and determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to n
- `ops` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple
- `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`
- `p2` is an empty list

The code snippet is:
```python
(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
```

Here, `v1` and `v2` are not defined in the initial state, so we need to assume they are part of the `ops` list. Since `ops` is a list of tuples and we don't know the exact values, let's assume `v1` and `v2` are the first tuple in `ops`, i.e., `v1, v2 = ops[0]`.

Let's break down the code:
- `p1[-1]` is the last element of the list `p1`.
- The expression `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1)` evaluates to `p2` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`; otherwise, it evaluates to `p1`.
- `.append(v1)` appends `v1` to the list determined by the previous condition.

Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:
1. If `p1[-1] == v2`, `p2.append(v1)` is executed.
2. If `p1[-1] != v2`, `p1.append(v1)` is executed.

Since `p1` initially contains the two integers from `vx` and `p2` is empty, the output state will depend on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2` or not.

**Output State:**
- If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` will contain `v1` and `p1` remains unchanged.
- If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1` will contain `v1` appended to it and `p2` remains unchanged.

Given that the exact values of `v1` and `v2` are not specified, we can generalize the output state as follows:

If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` will be `[v1]` and `p1` will remain the same.
If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1` will be `[p1[0], p1[1], v1]` and `p2` will remain `[]`.

Since the exact values of `v1` and `v2` are not provided, we can't specify the exact values in the output state. However, we can describe the updated state based on the conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to n, `ops` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` with possibly `v1` appended if `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is an empty list or contains `v1` if `p1[-1] == v2`.**
