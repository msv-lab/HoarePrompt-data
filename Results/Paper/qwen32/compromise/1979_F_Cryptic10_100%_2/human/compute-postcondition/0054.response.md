The code snippet `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends the tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. This means that the list `ops` will now contain the original elements it had, plus the new tuple `(v1, v2)` at the end.

Given the initial state, the only variable that is directly affected by this code is `ops`. The other variables (`vx`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, `v2`, `v3`) remain unchanged unless `v2` is less than or equal to 0, in which case `v3` and the structure of `ops` are also affected. However, since the code snippet only appends `(v1, v2)` to `ops`, we will consider the general case where `v2` is greater than 0, as the specific handling of `v2 <= 0` is not addressed in the given code snippet.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to 4 excluding `v1` (and possibly `v3` if the new `v2` is less than or equal to 0); `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if the new `v2` is greater than 0, otherwise it is `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` plus the new tuple `(v1, v2)`; `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any additional integers `v1` appended during loop iterations where `p1[-1] != v2`; `p2` contains any integers `v1` appended during loop iterations where `p1[-1] == v2`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`; `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` if the new `v2` is less than or equal to 0.**
