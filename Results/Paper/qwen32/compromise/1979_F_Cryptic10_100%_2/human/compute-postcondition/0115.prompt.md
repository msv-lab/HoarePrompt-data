Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function does not take any input variables directly. The input is provided through an interactive process where the function can make queries to learn about the graph and then output the Hamiltonian path. Specifically, for each test case, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) is provided, representing the number of vertices in the graph. The function can then make up to n queries of the form "? d" (0 ≤ d ≤ n - 1) to gather information about the graph's structure. The function must output the Hamiltonian path in the format "! v1 v2 ... vn" after determining it. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function `q` is defined to take an integer `d`, print a query string `"? d"`, and return a list of integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    vx, ops = set(i for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1)), []
    while len(vx) > 2:
        v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
        vx.remove(v1)
        if v2 > 0:
            ops += [(v1, v2)]
        else:
            v3, _ = q(0)
            vx.remove(v3)
            ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]
    p1, p2 = list(vx), []
    for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
        (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
    print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `p1` will contain the initial two integers from `vx` plus any additional integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] != v2`.
- `p2` will contain any integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] == v2`.

Since the exact values of `v1` and `v2` in `ops` are not specified, we can only describe the final state in terms of what has been appended to `p1` and `p2` based on the conditions.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers; `ops` is a list of tuples representing operations; `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any `v1` values that did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of processing; `p2` contains any `v1` values that matched the last element of `p1` at the time of processing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p1` contains all `v1` values from `ops` that did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation, and `p2` contains all `v1` values from `ops` that matched the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
