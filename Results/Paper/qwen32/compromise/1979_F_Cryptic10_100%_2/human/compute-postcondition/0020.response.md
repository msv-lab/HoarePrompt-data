Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 4. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` ≤ 0). `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(v1, v2), (v1, v2)]` if `v2` > 0, otherwise it contains `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is removed from `vx` and `ops` also contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` and `_` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts of the program fragment.
