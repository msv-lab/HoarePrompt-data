Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to n; `ops` is a list of tuples recording the operations performed during each iteration of the loop; `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`; `p2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` will contain `v1` and `p1` remains unchanged.
- If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1` will contain `v1` appended to it and `p2` remains unchanged.

Given that the exact values of `v1` and `v2` are not specified, we can generalize the output state as follows:

If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` will be `[v1]` and `p1` will remain the same.
If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1` will be `[p1[0], p1[1], v1]` and `p2` will remain `[]`.

Since the exact values of `v1` and `v2` are not provided, we can't specify the exact values in the output state. However, we can describe the updated state based on the conditions.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p1` and `p2` are as they are at the end of the previous iteration except that if `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` has `v1` appended to it; otherwise, `p1` has `v1` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p1` and `p2` are as they were at the end of the previous iteration, except that if `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` now includes `v1` appended to it; otherwise, `p1` now includes `v1` appended to it. `(v1, v2)` is the next element in `ops` when iterating in reverse order.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
