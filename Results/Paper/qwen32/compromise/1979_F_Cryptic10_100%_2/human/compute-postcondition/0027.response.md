The code snippet appends two tuples to the list `ops`. The tuples added are `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are determined by the function `q`. The initial state specifies that `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`.

Since the code only modifies `ops` by appending the specified tuples, the values of `n`, `vx`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` remain unchanged. The only change is in `ops`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` > 0, `v3` is now removed from `vx`); `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(v1, v2), (v1, v2), (v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` if `v2` > 0, otherwise it contains `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`; `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`.**
