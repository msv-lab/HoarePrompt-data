There are multiple test cases, each with a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in a graph. The graph starts as a complete undirected graph with n vertices, from which exactly (n - 2) edges have been removed. The function interacts with an interactor to determine a Hamiltonian path in the original graph using at most n queries. Each query asks for a vertex with a degree of at least d and a vertex not connected to it, and the interactor responds with the specified vertices or "0 0" if no such vertex exists. The interactor is non-adaptive, and the graph does not change during interaction. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
