To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables or the state of the program. However, based on the given initial state and the provided code snippet, we can infer that `func_1()` might modify some variables or perform certain operations.

Since there is no additional information about `func_1()`, let's assume it doesn't modify any variables or return any values (a no-op function). In this case, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2**.
