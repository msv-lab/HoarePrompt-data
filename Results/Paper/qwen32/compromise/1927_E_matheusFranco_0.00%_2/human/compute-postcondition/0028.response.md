The code snippet provided increments the value of `curr_v` by 1. Given the initial state, `curr_v` was `m+3`. After the operation, `curr_v` becomes `m+4`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, except `permutation[i]` is now `m+2` and `permutation[i + k]` is `m+3`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+4`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + k`; `i` is the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1`; `n` must be greater than `2k - 1`.**
