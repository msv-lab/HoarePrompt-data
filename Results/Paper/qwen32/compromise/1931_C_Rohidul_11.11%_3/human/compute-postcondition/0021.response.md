To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `r` and `a[r]`.

The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
1. `r > l`
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are equal and there are at least two different elements in the list.
- `l` is the first index `k` where `a[k] != a[k + 1]` or `n - 2` if all elements are equal.
- `r` is `n - 3`.
- `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0.
- `end` is 2.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `r > l`:**
   - This condition needs to be satisfied. Since `r` is `n - 3` and `l` is the first index where `a[k] != a[k + 1]` or `n - 2`, we need to ensure that `n - 3 > l`.
   - If `n - 3 > l`, then this condition is already satisfied.

2. **Condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]`:**
   - This condition needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute again.
   - Since `r` is `n - 3`, we need `a[n - 3] == a[n - 4]`.
   - Given that the last two elements of `a` are equal, `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`, but this doesn't directly affect `a[n - 3]` and `a[n - 4]`.
   - To ensure `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, we need to adjust `a[n - 3]` and `a[n - 4]` to be equal if they are not already.

### Conclusion:
- `r` should remain `n - 3` unless `n - 3 <= l`, in which case we need to adjust `r` to be greater than `l`.
- `a[n - 3]` and `a[n - 4]` should be equal to ensure `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

Given the constraints and the need to satisfy the loop condition for one more iteration, we adjust `a[n - 3]` and `a[n - 4]` to be equal and ensure `r > l`.
