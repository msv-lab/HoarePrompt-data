Postcondition: **`l` remains 0, `r` remains 0, `end` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is either `len(a) - 1` if `st == 0` and `end == 0` and `a[0] != a[-1]`, or `ans` is 0 if `st` is not 0, or `end` is not 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a` unless `end` is not 0 and `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`.**
