To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the provided state information.

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as:
1. `r` is greater than `l`.
2. The element at index `r` in array `a` is equal to the element at index `r - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `r - 1` (and must be at least 0).
- `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`.
- `end` is increased by 2 (this variable is not part of the loop condition and thus can be ignored for this task).

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to verify if both conditions of the loop can be satisfied:
1. `r > l` should hold true. Since `l` is 0 and `r` is `r - 1` (but must be at least 0), `r` must be at least 1 for the condition `r > l` to be true.
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]` should hold true. According to the state, this condition is already satisfied.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `r` is at least 1. Since `r` is `r - 1` and must be at least 0, we can adjust `r` to be 1 to satisfy the `r > l` condition.

State: **`l` is 0, `r` must be 1, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`**
