The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state that `r` is 1, after executing the code, `r` becomes 0. The condition `a[r] is equal to a[r - 1]` is no longer directly relevant since `r` has changed, but we can infer that `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]` if we were to consider the array `a` in a circular or wrapped-around manner, but this is not specified in the problem, so we just update `r`.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is 0**
