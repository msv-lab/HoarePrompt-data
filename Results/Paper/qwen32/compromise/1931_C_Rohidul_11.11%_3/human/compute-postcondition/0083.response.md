Output State: **`l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` must be greater than 3, `a[3]` is equal to `a[0]`, `end` is 0, `ans` is -1 if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st == 0` and `end == 0`, or `ans` is 0 if `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`, `st` is 3**

The value of `st` has been incremented by 1, making `st` equal to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
