The `while` loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `a[l + 1]` such that both conditions are satisfied.

1. **Condition `l < r`**: This condition is already satisfied because `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `r` is at least 1, and thus `l < r` holds true.

2. **Condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`**: This condition is also satisfied because `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`. Given `l` is 2, `a[l]` is `a[2]` and `a[l + 1]` is `a[3]`. To satisfy `a[l] == a[l + 1]`, we need `a[2] == a[3]`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `a[3]` to be equal to `a[2]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is the list of integers from the input where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]`; `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 2; `end` is 0; If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a` and both `st` and `end` are 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
