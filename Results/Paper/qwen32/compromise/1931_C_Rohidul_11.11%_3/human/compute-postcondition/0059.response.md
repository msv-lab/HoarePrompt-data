Given the loop and the initial conditions, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the provided output states after the first three iterations.

The loop is defined as:
```python
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1
```

The conditions for the loop to execute are:
1. `r > l`
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`

The loop body performs two actions:
1. Decrements `r` by 1.
2. Increments `end` by 1.

Let's analyze the output states provided:
- **After 1 iteration:** `l` is 0, `r` is 0, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `end` is increased by 1.
  - This implies that initially, `r` must have been 1 (since it is decremented to 0), and `a[1]` was equal to `a[0]`. `end` was incremented to 1.
- **After 2 iterations:** `l` is 0, `r` is `r - 1` (and must be at least 0), `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `end` is increased by 2.
  - This implies that after the first iteration, `r` was 0, and it was decremented to -1, but since the loop condition `r > l` failed (`r` is not greater than `l`), the loop did not execute a second time. However, the provided state seems to indicate that `r` was decremented again, suggesting an error in the provided state. Assuming the correct state should have been `r` remains 0 and `end` is 2, this would mean the loop condition failed after the first decrement.
- **After 3 iterations:** `l` is 0, `r` is 0, `end` is 1.
  - This seems inconsistent with the previous states and the loop logic. Given the loop condition and the behavior, `r` should not have been decremented to 0 again if `a[r] == a[r - 1]` was not true.

Based on the analysis, the correct interpretation should be:
- After 1 iteration: `r` was decremented from 1 to 0, `end` was incremented to 1.
- After 2 iterations: `r` should not have been decremented again because `r` is not greater than `l` (0 > 0 is false).

Therefore, the loop would have stopped after the first iteration since `r` became 0 and `r > l` failed.

**Final Output State:**
- `l` remains 0.
- `r` is 0.
- `end` is 1.

Output State: **l is 0, r is 0, end is 1.**

In natural language: After all iterations, `l` remains 0, `r` is 0, and `end` is 1. The loop stops after the first iteration because `r` is no longer greater than `l`.
