The code snippet increments the variable `end` by 1. The previous value of `end` is 2, so after the operation, `end` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are equal, `a[n - 3] == a[n - 4]`, and there are at least two different elements in the list; `l` is the first index `k` where `a[k] != a[k + 1]` or `n - 2` if all elements are equal; `r` is `n - 4` and `r > l`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0; `end` is 3**.
