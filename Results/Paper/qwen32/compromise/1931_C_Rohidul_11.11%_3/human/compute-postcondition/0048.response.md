The code snippet increments the value of `st` by 1. Initially, `st` is 2, so after the increment, `st` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is the list of integers from the input where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]`; `l` is 3; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 3; `end` is 0; If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a` and both `st` and `end` are 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
