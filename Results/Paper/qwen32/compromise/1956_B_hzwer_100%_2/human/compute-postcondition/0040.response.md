To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the Python code snippet provided.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Understanding `max(0, x - 1)`**:
   - For any value `x` in the list `cnt`, `max(0, x - 1)` computes the maximum between 0 and `x - 1`.
   - This means if `x` is greater than 1, `max(0, x - 1)` will be `x - 1`.
   - If `x` is 1 or less, `max(0, x - 1)` will be 0.

2. **Summing up**:
   - `ans` is the sum of these computed values for every element in `cnt`.
   - Essentially, `ans` will be the sum of all `(x - 1)` values where `x` is greater than 1, and it will ignore any `x` that is 1 or less.

### Final Output Description:
- Since the exact contents of `cnt` are not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
- However, based on the given information, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.

Thus, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all x in cnt)**
