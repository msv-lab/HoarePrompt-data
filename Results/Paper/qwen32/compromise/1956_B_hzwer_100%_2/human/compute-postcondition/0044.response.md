The code initializes `cnt` to a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. This means all elements in `cnt` are set to 0. The values of `ans`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**
