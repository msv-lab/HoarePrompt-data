The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. This operation does not affect the variables `ans` and `n`.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
