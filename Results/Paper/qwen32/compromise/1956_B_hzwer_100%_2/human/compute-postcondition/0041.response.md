In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't intend to use within the loop body. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, its value does not affect the logic inside the loop. The only state that could influence whether the loop continues or not is the number of iterations left, which is determined by the input value.

Given that the loop runs for `int(input())` times, the state at the start of each iteration does not need to change in terms of the loop variable `_`. However, the number of iterations left would decrease by one after each iteration.

Since we are not given any specific state related to the loop variable `_` or the input value, and since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state, the only thing that changes conceptually is the number of iterations left, which is not a part of the provided state.

Thus, the state remains the same in terms of the variables provided:

State: **`ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`**
