The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable) and the range function dependent on `input()`. Since the loop iterates based on the value of `int(input())`, which is `t`, we need to adjust `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is the current value of `int(input())`, and since the loop runs `t` times, after `t` iterations, `t` would have decremented to 0 internally within the loop construct. To execute one more iteration, `t` should be such that it allows for one more decrement before reaching 0.

However, since `t` is derived from `input()` and does not change within the loop in the provided code snippet, we need to consider the state right before the loop starts its next iteration. The loop control variable `_` does not affect the state directly, so we focus on `t`.

Given that `t` is initially set to `n` and the loop runs `t` times, to execute one more iteration, `t` should be incremented by 1 before the loop starts its next iteration, ensuring that the loop condition `int(input())` evaluates to a value that allows for one more iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` (and consequently `n`) is incremented by 1.

State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where each `cnt[x]` represents the number of times `x` appears in the list `a`; `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.**
