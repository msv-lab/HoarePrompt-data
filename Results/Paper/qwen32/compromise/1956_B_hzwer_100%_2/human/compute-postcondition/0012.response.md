The code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `input`, `t`, `n`, `a`, or `cnt`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `ans`.

Output State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where each `cnt[x]` represents the number of times `x` appears in the list `a`; `ans` is 0.**
