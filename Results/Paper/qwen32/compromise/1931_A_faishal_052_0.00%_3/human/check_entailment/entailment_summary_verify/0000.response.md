Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description and the function summary to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word such that the sum of the positions of its letters in the alphabet equals a given integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78).

### Program Analysis
Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Function Summary Recap
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `lex` (3 ≤ lex ≤ 78). For each test case, it determines three characters based on the value of `lex` and prints these characters concatenated together. The characters are derived from the English alphabet, with the value of `lex` being adjusted to map to specific letters.

### Issues in the Provided Program
1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Value**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the remaining value after assigning the first two letters. It does not ensure that the remaining value can be represented by a single letter (i.e., a value between 1 and 26).

2. **Sorting the Letters**:
   - The program sorts the letters after assigning them, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest word, so the letters should be assigned in ascending order without sorting.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when the input value is 3, the output should be "aaa", but the program might not handle this correctly.

### Example Analysis
Let's consider a specific example where the program fails:

- **Input**: `3`
- **Expected Output**: `aaa`
- **Actual Output**: The program might output something like `aaz` or another incorrect combination because it doesn't correctly handle the remaining value after assigning the first two letters.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we should:
- Start with the smallest possible letters (1, 1, 1).
- Assign the remaining value to the third letter.
- Adjust the second and first letters if necessary to ensure all values are between 1 and 26.
- Print the letters in the correct order without sorting.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters
        a = b = c = 1
        # Assign the remaining value to the third letter
        remaining = n - 3
        if remaining > 0:
            c += remaining
            if c > 26:
                b += c - 26
                c = 26
                if b > 26:
                    a += b - 26
                    b = 26
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded. The provided original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
