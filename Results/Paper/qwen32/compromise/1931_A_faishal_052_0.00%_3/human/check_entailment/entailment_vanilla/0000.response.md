Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
   - For each test case, an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded sum of positions of the letters in the alphabet.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have resulted in the given encoded sum.

### Key Points:
- The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest word, which means the letters should be as early in the alphabet as possible.
- The sum of the positions of the letters should equal `n`.
- The word must consist of exactly 3 letters.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then reads each test case's encoded sum `n`.

2. **Constructing the Word**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop to determine the positions of the first two letters.
     - If `lex` (the current sum) is less than or equal to 26, it assigns `1` to the current position and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52 but greater than 26, it assigns `26` to the current position and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it assigns `26` to the current position and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it assigns the remaining value of `lex` to the third position.
   - The program then sorts the list `arr` and converts each value to its corresponding letter by adding 96 (since 'a' is 97 in ASCII).

### Issues:
- The logic for determining the positions of the letters is incorrect. The program does not ensure that the sum of the positions equals `n` and does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.
- The sorting step at the end is unnecessary because the program is supposed to construct the lexicographically smallest word by assigning the smallest possible values first.

### Correct Approach:
- Start by assigning the smallest possible value (1) to the first two positions.
- Calculate the remaining value for the third position.
- Ensure the sum of all three positions equals `n`.
- Construct the word from these positions.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem. It does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word and does not correctly handle the sum of positions.

**Correctness: False**
