Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`. The letters are mapped to their positions in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.
3. It then tries to distribute this integer across three letters in a way that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest.
4. It does this by first filling the first two letters with the maximum possible value (26) if `lex` is greater than 26, and fills the remaining value in the third letter.
5. It sorts the array of values and converts them to characters by adding 96 (since 'a' is 97 in ASCII).
6. It prints the resulting word.

However, there are a few issues with the program:
1. The distribution strategy is flawed. The program doesn't guarantee that the word will be lexicographically smallest. For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might output "zaz" instead of "aav".
2. The condition checks for `lex <= 26` and `lex < 52` are not sufficient to ensure the smallest possible word. The program should always try to use the smallest possible values first.
3. The sorting step is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem, as the order of letters should be determined by the logic of minimizing the word lexicographically.

A correct approach would be to start with the smallest possible letters and incrementally increase them while ensuring the sum matches `lex`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters
        a = b = c = 1
        # Distribute the remaining value after accounting for 'aaa'
        remaining = lex - 3
        # Increment 'c' first, then 'b', then 'a'
        if remaining > 0:
            c += min(remaining, 25)
            remaining -= min(remaining, 25)
        if remaining > 0:
            b += min(remaining, 25)
            remaining -= min(remaining, 25)
        if remaining > 0:
            a += remaining
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

# Call the function to process input
func()
```

Given these issues, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
