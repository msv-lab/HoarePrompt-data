Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 1 if it was originally <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer in the range 0 to 25 if it was originally in the range 27 to 51, or greater than 0 if it was originally > 51, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 6 elements where the last element is 26 and the second-to-last element is 26 if `lex` (after decrementing by 1) is greater than 25 and less than 51, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2**

Explanation: The code appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, increasing its length by one. All other variables remain unchanged.
