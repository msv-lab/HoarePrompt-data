In the provided code snippet, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for j in range(2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute based on the range provided, which is `range(2)`. This means the loop will execute exactly 2 times, with `j` taking the values 0 and 1.

The variables in the loop head are `j` and the range `2`. However, the range is a constant and does not need to be modified. The variable `j` is an iteration variable that will be automatically set to 0 and then 1 during the loop execution, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Since the loop's execution is solely dependent on the range, which is fixed, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t`, `lex`, `n`, `cases`, or `arr` to ensure the loop executes. The loop will execute as long as the program reaches this point, regardless of the values of `t`, `lex`, `n`, `cases`, or `arr`.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list**
