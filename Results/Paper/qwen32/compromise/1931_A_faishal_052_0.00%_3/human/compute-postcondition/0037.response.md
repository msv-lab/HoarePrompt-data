The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Given the possible initial values of `arr`, here are the sorted states:

- If `arr` was initially `[1, 1, 1]`, it remains `[1, 1, 1]`.
- If `arr` was initially `[26, 1, 1]`, it becomes `[1, 1, 26]`.
- If `arr` was initially `[1, 26, 1]`, it becomes `[1, 1, 26]`.
- If `arr` was initially `[26, 26, 1]`, it becomes `[1, 26, 26]`.

The values of `t`, `lex`, `cases`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then `lex` is now `lex - 2` (and thus less than or equal to 24), otherwise `lex` is `lex - 27` if it was initially between 26 and 51, or `lex - 52` if it was initially between 52 and 77, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, or `[1, 26, 26]`, and `j` is 1.**
