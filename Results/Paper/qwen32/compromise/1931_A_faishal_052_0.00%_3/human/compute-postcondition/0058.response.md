Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is the integer value provided by the user input minus 26 and is greater than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is [26], `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3.**

In natural language: The value of `lex` has been reduced by 26, so it is now the initial value provided by the user input minus 26, and it remains greater than 26. All other variables retain their initial values.
