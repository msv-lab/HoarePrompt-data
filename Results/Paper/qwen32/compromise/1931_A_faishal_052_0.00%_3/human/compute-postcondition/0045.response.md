The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `cases`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 (since `j` is 1 and `k` is 3, implying that `i` must have been 1 to reach this point in the loop), and `cases` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `cases` must be such that `i` is still less than `cases`.

Since `i` is currently 1, for the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The condition `i < cases` must hold true, so `cases` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, lex is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then lex is now lex - 2 (and thus less than or equal to 24), otherwise lex is lex - 27 if it was initially between 26 and 51, or lex - 52 if it was initially between 52 and 77, cases is greater than 2, arr is a list that is either [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 26], or [1, 26, 26], and `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**
