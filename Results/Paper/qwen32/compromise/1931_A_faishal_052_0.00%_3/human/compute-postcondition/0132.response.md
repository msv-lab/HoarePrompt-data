The given loop iterates exactly 3 times, as specified by `for k in range(3)`. During each iteration, the loop prints a character corresponding to the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`. The loop does not modify any of the variables `t`, `lex`, `cases`, `i`, or `j`. The only variable that changes within the loop is `k`, which takes the values 0, 1, and 2 in successive iterations.

Given that `arr` is a sorted list with 3 elements, and the first two elements are either 1 or 26, and the third element is `lex`, the output will be the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96`.

Since the loop runs exactly 3 times, the output state will be the same as the state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that the loop has completed all its iterations.

To determine the output, let's assume the values of `arr` based on the given constraints:
- Let's assume `arr = [1, 26, lex]` (as an example, since the first two elements can be either 1 or 26, and `lex` is the third element).

The characters corresponding to these values would be:
- `arr[0] + 96 = 1 + 96 = 97` → 'a'
- `arr[1] + 96 = 26 + 96 = 122` → 'z'
- `arr[2] + 96 = lex + 96` → The character corresponding to `lex + 96`

Since the exact value of `lex` is not specified, let's denote the character corresponding to `lex + 96` as `chr(lex + 96)`.

Thus, the output of the loop will be the concatenation of these characters: 'az' followed by the character corresponding to `lex + 96`.

Output State: **'az' + chr(lex + 96)**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be a string that starts with 'az' followed by a character determined by the value of `lex + 96`. The values of `t`, `lex`, `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and `k` will have completed its iterations, ending with the value 2.
