In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `k`, which is the loop variable for the `range(3)`. The loop will execute if `k` starts within the range `[0, 2]` because `range(3)` generates numbers from 0 to 2 inclusive.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `lex` is adjusted based on its original value (decremented by 1 or 26 for each iteration)
- `cases` is greater than 2
- `arr` is a sorted list with 3 elements (the first two being either 1 or 26, and the third being `lex`)
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 2
- `k` is 2

The state of `k` is the only one that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. Since the loop will iterate over `k` from 0 to 2, we need to set `k` to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its original value (decremented by 1 or 26 for each iteration), `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a sorted list with 3 elements (the first two being either 1 or 26, and the third being `lex`), `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 0**
