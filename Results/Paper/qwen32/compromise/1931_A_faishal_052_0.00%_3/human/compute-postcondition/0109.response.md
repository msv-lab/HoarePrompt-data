The code snippet `lex = lex - 26` modifies the value of `lex` by subtracting 26 from it. Given the initial conditions, if `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, the last element of `arr` remains 26. If `lex` is initially 26 or less, the code does not apply as per the initial state description.

Since `lex` is initially described as being greater than 26 when the operation applies, after the operation, `lex` will be in the range 0 to 25 (inclusive), assuming it was originally in the range 27 to 51 (inclusive).

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer in the range 0 to 25 (if it was originally in the range 27 to 51), `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 5 elements (the last element is 26), `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2.**
