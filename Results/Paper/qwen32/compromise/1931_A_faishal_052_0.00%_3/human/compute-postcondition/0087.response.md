To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value but is less than 26.
   - `cases` is greater than 2.
   - `arr` is one of the following lists: \([1, 1, lex]\), \([1, lex, 26]\), or \([lex, 26, 26]\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `k` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The value of `k` is 2.
   - Therefore, `arr[k]` refers to the third element of the list `arr`.
   - Depending on which list `arr` is, `arr[2]` can be `lex`, `26`, or `26`.

4. **Determining `arr[2]`**:
   - If `arr` is \([1, 1, lex]\), then `arr[2]` is `lex`.
   - If `arr` is \([1, lex, 26]\), then `arr[2]` is `26`.
   - If `arr` is \([lex, 26, 26]\), then `arr[2]` is `26`.

5. **Converting to Character**:
   - The `chr()` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - `chr(arr[2] + 96)` translates to:
     - If `arr[2]` is `lex`, then `chr(lex + 96)`.
     - If `arr[2]` is `26`, then `chr(26 + 96)` which is `chr(122)` which is `'z'`.

6. **Final Output**:
   - Since `lex` is less than 26, `chr(lex + 96)` will be a lowercase letter from `'a'` to `'y'`.
   - If `arr[2]` is `26`, the output will be `'z'`.

Given the information, the most precise description of the output is that it will print a lowercase letter from `'a'` to `'z'`, depending on the value of `lex` or `26`.

Output: **a character from 'a' to 'z' (where the character is determined by chr(arr[2] + 96))**
