Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input minus 1 if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, otherwise `lex` is `lex - 26`, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1, 1], [26, 1], [1, 26], or [26, 26] depending on the initial value of `lex`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3.**
