The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, which means the loop condition is no longer satisfied, and the loop will not execute again.

Since the loop will not execute again, there is no need to adjust the state for another iteration. However, if we were to consider the state just before the loop would terminate (i.e., the state at the start of the last iteration), `k` would have been 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its original value (decremented by 1 or 26 for each iteration), `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a sorted list with 3 elements (the first two being either 1 or 26, and the third being `lex`), `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 2**
