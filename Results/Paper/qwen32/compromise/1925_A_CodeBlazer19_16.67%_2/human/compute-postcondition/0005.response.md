Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `s` is the string 'a', `j` is 97**.

Explanation: The variable `s` has been updated to contain the string 'a' because `chr(97)` corresponds to the character 'a'. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged.
