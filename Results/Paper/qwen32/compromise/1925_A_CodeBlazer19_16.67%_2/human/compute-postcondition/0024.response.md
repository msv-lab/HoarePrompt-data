The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by `chr(j)` to the existing string `s`. Given that `j` is `k + 98`, the character added to `s` is `chr(k + 98)`. 

The initial state of `s` is a string containing `chr(j)` followed by `chr(k + 97)`. After appending `chr(j)`, which is `chr(k + 98)`, the string `s` will now contain `chr(j)`, `chr(k + 97)`, and `chr(k + 98)`.

The other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `j`) remain unchanged in value.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing `chr(j)`, `chr(k + 97)`, and `chr(k + 98)`; `i` is `i + 1`; `t` remains unchanged; `n` is the first input integer; `k` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `k + 98`.**
