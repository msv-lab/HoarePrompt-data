To determine the state required for the for loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which in this case is `for j in range(97, k + 97):`. The loop will execute if the range is non-empty, which means the start of the range (97) must be less than the end of the range (k + 97).

Let's break down the necessary adjustments step-by-step:

1. **Variable `j`**: This variable is introduced by the loop and does not need an initial state before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `k`**: This variable determines the end of the range. For the loop to execute, the condition `97 < k + 97` must be true, which simplifies to `0 < k`. Therefore, `k` must be a positive integer.

3. **Variable `s`**: This variable is mentioned but not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

4. **Variable `i`**: This variable is mentioned but not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

5. **Variable `t`**: This variable is mentioned but not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

6. **Variable `n`**: This variable is mentioned but not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these considerations, the only variable we need to ensure is adjusted is `k` to be greater than 0.

State: **`s` is an empty string, `i` is the value it was at the start of the last iteration plus 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` must be greater than 0**
