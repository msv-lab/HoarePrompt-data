To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop behaves and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop iterates over the range from 97 to `k + 97`. The variable `j` starts at 97 and increments by 1 in each iteration. In each iteration, the character corresponding to `j` (using `chr(j)`) is appended to the string `s`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, it's clear that `s` accumulates characters starting from 'a' (ASCII 97) up to the character corresponding to `k + 96`. The loop will continue until `j` reaches `k + 96`.

Therefore, after all iterations, the string `s` will contain the first `k` letters of the English alphabet.

**Output State: s is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' if k is 26; otherwise, s is the string of the first k letters of the alphabet.**

Since `k` can be any integer from 1 to 26, the final string `s` will be the first `k` letters of the alphabet.

To put it in the required format:

Output State: **s is the string of the first k letters of the alphabet.**
