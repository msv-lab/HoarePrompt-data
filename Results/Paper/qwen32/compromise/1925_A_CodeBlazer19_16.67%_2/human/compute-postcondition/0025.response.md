To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior. The loop iterates from `97` to `k + 97`, and in each iteration, it appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`.

Here's the breakdown of the loop:
- The loop starts with `j = 97` and continues until `j = k + 96`.
- In each iteration, `s += chr(j)` adds the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`.

After the loop completes, `s` will contain all the characters from `chr(97)` to `chr(k + 96)`. These correspond to the ASCII values of lowercase letters starting from 'a' up to the `k`-th letter in the alphabet.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, the final output state can be described as follows:
- `s` will be a string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet.
- `i` will be `i + 1` (unchanged from the loop's perspective).
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **s is a string containing the first k lowercase letters of the alphabet; i is i + 1; t remains unchanged; n is the first input integer; k is the second input integer.**

In simpler terms, `s` will be a string like "abc...xyz" (up to the `k`-th letter), and the other variables will remain as they were initially, except `i` which will be incremented by 1.
