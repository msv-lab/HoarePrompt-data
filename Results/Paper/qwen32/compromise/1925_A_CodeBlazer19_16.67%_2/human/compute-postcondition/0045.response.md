Postcondition: **`s` is a string containing characters from 'a' to 'a' if `k` is equal to 1, otherwise `s` is a string containing characters from 'a' to chr(k + 96). `i` is the initial value of `i` plus 1 if `k` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is the initial value of `i` plus `k`. `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `k` remains unchanged.**
