Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer provided by the input such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = ''
    for j in range(97, k + 97):
        s += chr(j)
    if k == 1:
        print(n * s)
    else:
        print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: s is the string of the first k letters of the alphabet. If k is equal to 1, then s contains only the first letter of the alphabet. Otherwise, s contains the first k letters of the alphabet where k is greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `i` is `i + 1`; `t` remains unchanged; `n` is the first input integer; `k` is the second input integer. If `k` is equal to 1, `s` specifically contains the first lowercase letter of the alphabet. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 1, and `s` contains the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet as given.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string containing characters from 'a' to 'a' if `k` is equal to 1, otherwise `s` is a string containing characters from 'a' to chr(k + 96). `i` is the initial value of `i` plus 1 if `k` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is the initial value of `i` plus `k`. `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `k` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
