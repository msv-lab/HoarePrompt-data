The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Given that `j` is 99, `chr(j)` will be 'c'. Therefore, the string `s` which was initially 'ab' will now be 'abc'.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `s` is the string 'abc'; `j` is 99**.
