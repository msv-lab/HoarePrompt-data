The code updates the value of `g` by multiplying it with `l[i]` and then dividing by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. This is a common method to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of more than two numbers.

Given that `i` is 2, the new value of `g` will be the LCM of `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[2]`.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[2]`, `l` is a list with at least two elements, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a` before the update, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is 2**.
