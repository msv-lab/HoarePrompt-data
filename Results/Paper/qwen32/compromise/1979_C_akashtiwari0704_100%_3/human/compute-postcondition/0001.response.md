The only variable in the loop head is `T`, which is the loop variable iterating over the range of `t`. Since `t` is already given as an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variables `n` and the list of integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only thing that needs to be ensured is that `T` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, as the `range(t)` function will start `T` from 0 and go up to `t-1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0**
