Output State: **`bets` is an integer such that `bets > 0`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `ans` includes the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space, then the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space, and so on until the string representation of `a[bets - 1]` followed by a space.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will contain a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to its string representation and concatenated with a space in between, from the first element of `a` to the last element of `a`. The loop variable `i` will have the value `bets - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `a`. All other variables mentioned in the initial state that are not affected by the loop remain unchanged.
