The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given that `i` is equal to `bets`, the value of `a[i]` is `a[bets]`. Initially, `sumo` is defined as `int(a[i]) + int(a[bets])`, which simplifies to `2 * int(a[bets])` because `i` is `bets`. After executing the code, `sumo` will be `2 * int(a[bets]) + int(a[bets])`, which simplifies to `3 * int(a[bets])`.

Therefore, the updated value of `sumo` is `3 * int(a[bets])`.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer such that `bets` >= 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list where the `i`-th element (where `i` is `bets`) is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is `3 * int(a[bets])`, `i` is `bets`**
