The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state and the variables described in the precondition do not influence the value printed by this statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `-1`, regardless of the values of `bets`, `t`, `T`, `g`, `l`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `i`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The `print(-1)` statement is executed.
2. The value `-1` is printed to the console.

The values of the variables `bets`, `t`, `T`, `g`, `l`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **-1**
