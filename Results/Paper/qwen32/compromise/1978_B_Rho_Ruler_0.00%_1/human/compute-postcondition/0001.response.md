Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `ans` is `k * b`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the product of `k` and `b`. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged as per the given constraints.
