Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a grid. The grid consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The function returns a result for each test case based on the grid configuration.**
