Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is the result of `input()`), `first_row` is the first character of each element in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is the last character of each element in `a` concatenated together, and `i` is 0. If the first element of `a` consists of identical characters and is not equal to the last element of `a`, the condition from the if part is met. Otherwise, either the first element of `a` does not consist of identical characters or it is equal to the last element of `a`.**
