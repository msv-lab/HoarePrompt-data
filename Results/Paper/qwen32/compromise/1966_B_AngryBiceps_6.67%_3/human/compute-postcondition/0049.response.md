The `print('NO')` statement in the provided code snippet will output the string 'NO' regardless of the values of the other variables and objects described in the initial state. The print statement is a direct output of the string 'NO' and does not depend on any other variable or condition in the code.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
2. The variable `n` is the first integer from the input.
3. The variable `m` is the second integer from the input.
4. The variable `a` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is obtained from the input.
5. The variable `first_row` is constructed by concatenating the first character of each element in `a`.
6. The variable `last_row` is constructed by concatenating the last character of each element in `a`.
7. The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
8. The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1, indicating that all characters in `first_row` are the same.
9. The variable `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, indicating that the first and last characters of the elements in `a` differ.

Despite these initial conditions, the print statement `print('NO')` does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
