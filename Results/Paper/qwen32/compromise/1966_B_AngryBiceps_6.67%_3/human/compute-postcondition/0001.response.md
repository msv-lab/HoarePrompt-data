Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer.**

Natural Language: The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The values of `n` and `m` are set to the two integers provided by the input, with `n` being the first integer and `m` being the second integer.
