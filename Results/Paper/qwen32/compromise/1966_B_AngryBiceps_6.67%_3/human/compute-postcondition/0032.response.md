To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `i` and the range `n`.

The provided state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is an empty list
- `first_row` is an empty string
- `last_row` is an empty string
- `i` is `n`

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

The variable `i` is set to `n` before the loop starts, but this does not affect the loop's execution. The loop will reassign `i` to the values generated by `range(n)` during each iteration.

Given this information, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n`**
