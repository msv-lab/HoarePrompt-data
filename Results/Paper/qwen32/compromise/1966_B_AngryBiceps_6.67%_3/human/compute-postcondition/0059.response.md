The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (this does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `n` is the first integer from the input (this determines if the loop will execute).
- `m` is the second integer from the input (this does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `a` is an empty list (this does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `first_row` is an empty string (this does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `last_row` is an empty string (this does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `i` is 0 (this is the starting value for the loop index).

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The value of `i` is already 0, which is correct for the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**
