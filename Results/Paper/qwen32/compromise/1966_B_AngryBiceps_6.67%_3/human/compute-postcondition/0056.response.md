The code snippet `a = []` reassigns the variable `a` to an empty list, effectively discarding the previous list that contained `n` elements. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is the first character of each element in the original `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is the last character of each element in the original `a` concatenated together, and `i` is 0.**
