Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input string. The first string in `a` has all identical characters, and it is not equal to the last string in `a`. `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each input string concatenated together, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each input string concatenated together, `i` is `n`.**
