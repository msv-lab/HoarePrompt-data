Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color. The key observation here is that if the first and last rows (or the first and last columns) are not uniform (i.e., they contain more than one color), then it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform using the given operation. This is because the operation can only fill in subrectangles, and if the first and last rows/columns are not uniform, there will be a "gap" or "boundary" that cannot be filled in by the operation.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself. It then checks:
1. If the first row is uniform and different from the last row.
2. If the first column is uniform and different from the last column.

If either of these conditions is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis:
The program's logic is based on the idea that if the first and last rows (or columns) are not uniform and different from each other, then the grid cannot be made uniform. However, this logic is not entirely correct. The program should check if the entire grid can be made uniform, not just the first and last rows/columns.

Here are some edge cases that the program does not handle correctly:
- If the grid has more than two rows, and the first and last rows are uniform but different, but the middle rows are uniform and match either the first or last row, the grid can still be made uniform.
- Similarly, if the grid has more than two columns, and the first and last columns are uniform but different, but the middle columns are uniform and match either the first or last column, the grid can still be made uniform.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases. It is too restrictive in checking only the first and last rows/columns. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
