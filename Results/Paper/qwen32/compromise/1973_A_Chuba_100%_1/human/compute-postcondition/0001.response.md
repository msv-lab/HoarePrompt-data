In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use, and `t` represents the number of iterations the loop will perform.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` is the only thing we can adjust according to the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
