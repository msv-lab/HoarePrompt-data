### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred based on the scores of three players in chess games. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`, which represent the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Sum of Scores Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3)` is odd. If it is, the program outputs `-1`. This is because the total points awarded in any number of games must be even (each game awards either 2 points in total or 2 points in total in the case of a draw).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
    - If the sum of scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
      \[
      \text{result} = \frac{(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - \max(0, p_3 - p_0 - p_1))}{2}
      \]
    - The term `\max(0, p_3 - p_0 - p_1)` adjusts for the scenario where player 3 has a score that is significantly higher than the combined scores of players 1 and 2. This ensures that the calculation does not result in a negative number of draws.
    - The result is then divided by 2 because each draw contributes 2 points to the total score.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program outputs either `-1` if the scores are inconsistent (sum is odd) or the calculated maximum number of draws.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0` -> Sum is 0 (even), no games were played, so no draws. Output: `0`.
- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1` -> Sum is 2 (even), one draw possible between second and third player. Output: `1`.
- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1` -> Sum is 3 (odd), inconsistent scores. Output: `-1`.
- **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2` -> Sum is 4 (even), two draws possible. Output: `2`.
- **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3` -> Sum is 9 (odd), inconsistent scores. Output: `-1`.
- **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5` -> Sum is 12 (even), six draws possible. Output: `6`.
- **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10` -> Sum is 12 (even), two draws possible. Output: `2`.

The program correctly handles all the given test cases, ensuring that the logic for determining the maximum number of draws is correct and consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
