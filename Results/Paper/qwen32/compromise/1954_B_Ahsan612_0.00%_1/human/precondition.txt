t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of integers a of length n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and each list a is guaranteed to be a beautiful array as defined in the problem description.
