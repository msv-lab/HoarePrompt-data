Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 4, `num` is `ar[4]`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 2 or 3.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is updated to be the element at index 4 of the list `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged.
