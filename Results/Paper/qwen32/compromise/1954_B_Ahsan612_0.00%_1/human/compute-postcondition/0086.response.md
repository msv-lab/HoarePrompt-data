The value of `i` is explicitly set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `num` is the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 1.**
