To determine the final state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables.

The loop iterates through the list `ar`, starting from the second element (since `i` is initialized to 1). It checks if the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num` (which is initially the first element of `ar`). If it is, it increments `same`. If not, it updates `i`, sets `num` to `ar[i]`, updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and `same`, and resets `same` to 1. The loop continues until `i` is no longer less than the length of `ar`.

### Key Points:
- `i` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- `num` keeps track of the current number being counted.
- `same` counts how many times `num` has appeared consecutively.
- `minn` keeps track of the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list.

### Final State:
After the loop has executed all iterations:
- `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` because the loop continues until `i` is no longer less than `len(ar)`.
- `num` will be the last number in `ar` that was checked.
- `same` will be the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.
- `minn` will be the minimum value of `same` observed during the loop, representing the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in `ar`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

In simpler terms, the loop will have finished iterating through the entire list `ar`, and the final state will reflect the last number checked, the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of any number, and the count of consecutive occurrences of the last number in the list.
