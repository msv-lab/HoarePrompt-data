Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 4 elements, `i` is either 4 or 5.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 3 or 4, it is now either 4 or 5. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `ar`) remain unchanged.
