Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 1 or 2. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` remains 1, `same` is set to 2, and `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to 2, `num` is updated to `ar[i]`, `minn` is set to 1, and `same` remains 1.**
