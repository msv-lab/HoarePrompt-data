The `while` loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, the variable `i` must be less than the length of the list `ar`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- If `i` is 3, the loop can execute again if `len(ar) > 3`.
- If `i` is 4, the loop can execute again if `len(ar) > 4`.

Since the problem states that `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 1, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(ar)` for the next iteration.

To guarantee the loop executes one more time, we should consider the worst-case scenario where `i` is at its maximum value before the loop terminates. Here, `i` can be 3 or 4 based on the conditions provided.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- If `i` is 3, we need `len(ar) > 3`.
- If `i` is 4, we need `len(ar) > 4`.

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time without making assumptions, we should consider the highest possible value of `i` from the given conditions, which is 4. Therefore, we need `len(ar) > 4`.

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 4. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 3, `num` remains the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 4, `num` is updated to `ar[3]`, `minn` is set to 2, and `same` is set to 1**.
