Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**
