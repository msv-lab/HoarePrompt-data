Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is inf, `i` is 1, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

In natural language: The value of `same` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
