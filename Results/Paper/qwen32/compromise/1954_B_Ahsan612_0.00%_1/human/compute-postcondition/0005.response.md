The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `minn` with the value `inf` (infinity). This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, or `num`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for these variables except for the newly introduced `minn`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is inf.**
