The value of `num` is updated to the first element of the list `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input, `i` is the length of the new `ar`, `num` is the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the new `ar`, and `same` is 1.
