The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Since the initial state provides that `minn` is the minimum consecutive count of any element in `ar` and `same` is 1, the new value of `minn` will be the minimum of these two values.

Given that `same` is 1, the new value of `minn` will be 1 if `minn` was previously greater than 1. If `minn` was already 1 or less, it will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique element in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1, `same` is 1.**
