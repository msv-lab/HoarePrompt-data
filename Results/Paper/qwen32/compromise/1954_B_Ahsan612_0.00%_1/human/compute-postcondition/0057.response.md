To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition `i < len(ar)`. Currently, `i` is 2, and `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

Given that `ar` has at least 2 elements, the minimum length of `ar` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than this length. Since `i` is currently 2, `ar` must have more than 2 elements to satisfy the condition `i < len(ar)`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ar` to ensure it has more than 2 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 1 or 2**
