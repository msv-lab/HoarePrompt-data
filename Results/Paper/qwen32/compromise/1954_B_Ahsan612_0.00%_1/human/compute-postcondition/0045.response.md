The code assigns the value `inf` (infinity) to the variable `minn`. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input, `i` is the length of the new `ar`, `num` is the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 1.**
