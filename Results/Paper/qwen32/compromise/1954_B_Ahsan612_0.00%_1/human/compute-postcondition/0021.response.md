The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given the initial state, `minn` can either be `inf` or `1`, and `same` can either be `1` or `2`.

- If `minn` is `inf` and `same` is `1`, then `minn` will be updated to `1`.
- If `minn` is `inf` and `same` is `2`, then `minn` will be updated to `2`.
- If `minn` is `1` and `same` is `1`, then `minn` will remain `1`.
- If `minn` is `1` and `same` is `2`, then `minn` will remain `1`.

In all cases, `minn` will be the minimum of its previous value and `same`. Therefore, `minn` will either be `1` or `2` after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 2 elements, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is either 1 or 2, and `same` is either 1 or 2.**
