Reasoning: The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The approach taken in the program is to find the smallest group of consecutive identical elements in the array. If such a group exists, removing all but one of the elements in this group will make the array non-beautiful. If the array consists of only one type of element throughout, the program correctly identifies that it's impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, and it returns -1.

However, there is a flaw in the logic of the program. The program does not correctly handle arrays where all elements are the same because the `minn` variable is initialized to `inf` and only updated when a different element is found. If all elements are the same, `minn` remains `inf`, and the program incorrectly outputs `-1`. The correct behavior should be to set `minn` to the length of the array in this case, as removing all but one element will make the array non-beautiful.

To fix this, the program should handle the case where all elements are the same by checking if `minn` is still `inf` after the loop and setting it to `n` (the length of the array) if it is.

Correctness: **False**
