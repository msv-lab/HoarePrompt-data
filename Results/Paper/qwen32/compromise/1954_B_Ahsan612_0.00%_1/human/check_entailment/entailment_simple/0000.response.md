### Reasoning:

The given problem asks for the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with its neighbor if the neighbor elements are the same.

The provided program aims to solve this problem by finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array. The logic is as follows:
1. For each test case, the program reads the array.
2. It initializes `same` to count the number of consecutive identical elements and `minn` to track the minimum length of such sequences.
3. It iterates through the array, updating `same` when it encounters consecutive identical elements. When it encounters a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum of its current value and `same`, then resets `same` to 1.
4. After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time to account for the last sequence of identical elements.
5. If `minn` is still `inf` (which theoretically should not happen given the problem constraints), it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

However, there is a fundamental flaw in the logic. The program assumes that the minimum length of consecutive identical elements is the solution, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to find the longest sequence of identical elements and then determine the minimum number of deletions needed to break this sequence. The minimum deletions required would be the length of the longest sequence minus one (since removing one element from the longest sequence would break the possibility of making all elements identical).

For example, in the fourth test case:
```
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The longest sequence of identical elements is `3 3 3` (which appears twice). To make the array non-beautiful, we need to remove at least 3 elements to break this sequence, which is the length of the longest sequence minus one.

### Correctness: **False**
