Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", and `cards` is a list of 2n unique strings where each string represents a card in the format "<rank><suit>", with rank being one of "23456789" and suit being one of "CDHS"; `trump` is the input character.**

Natural Language: The variable `trump` is now assigned the value of the input character. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards`) retain their initial values.
