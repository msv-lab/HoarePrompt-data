The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `trumps`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `trump`) are modified by this code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", and `cards` is a list of 2n unique strings where each string represents a card in the format "<rank><suit>", with rank being one of "23456789" and suit being one of "CDHS"; `trump` is the input character; `trumps` is an empty list.**
