### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining who will win the game given the rules and the initial configuration of the coins. The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U').

1. **Game Dynamics**:
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins ('U') left.
   - Each turn, a player removes a facing-up coin and flips the adjacent coins.
   - If there are two coins left and one is facing up, the remaining coin is not flipped when the last facing-up coin is removed.
   - If there is only one coin left, no coins are flipped.
   - If there are no facing-up coins, the player whose turn it is loses.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - The game can be analyzed using the concept of Grundy numbers (or Nimbers) from combinatorial game theory, but for this specific problem, a simpler observation suffices.
   - If the number of facing-up coins ('U') is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force a win.
   - If the number of facing-up coins ('U') is even, the second player (Bob) can always force a win.

3. **Explanation of the Code**:
   - The code reads the input, which contains multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' in the string `s`.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, it prints "YES" indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count of 'U' is even, it prints "NO" indicating Bob wins.

4. **Verification with Example**:
   - For the first test case (`UUDUD`), there are 3 'U's (an odd number), so the output is "YES".
   - For the second test case (`UDDUD`), there are 2 'U's (an even number), so the output is "NO".
   - For the third test case (`UU`), there are 2 'U's (an even number), so the output is "NO".

### Correctness:
The logic in the code correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
