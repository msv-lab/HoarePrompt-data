### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the `k`-th card laid down according to a specific sequence. The sequence is constructed by first laying out all odd-numbered cards, then all cards that are twice an odd number, then all cards that are three times an odd number, and so on.

The provided program implements a solution that uses a binary search-like approach to determine the `k`-th card. The key idea is to count the number of cards in each "layer" (odd numbers, numbers that are twice an odd number, etc.) and determine which layer the `k`-th card falls into.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which keeps track of the cumulative number of cards laid down so far.
   - `m` is initialized to 1, which represents the current multiplier (1, 2, 3, ...).

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop continues until all cards are accounted for (`while n`).
   - `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards in the current layer.
   - `n` is halved (`n //= 2`), effectively moving to the next layer (e.g., from odd numbers to numbers that are twice an odd number).
   - If the `k`-th card falls within the current layer (`if s < k and k <= s + x`), the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `s` is updated to include the cards in the current layer (`s += x`), and `m` is updated to the next multiplier (`m *= 2`).

3. **Output**:
   - The formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` calculates the `k`-th card based on the current layer and multiplier.

### Verification:

The program's logic aligns with the problem description. It correctly identifies the layer in which the `k`-th card falls and computes the card number using the appropriate multiplier. The use of binary division (`n //= 2`) and the cumulative count (`s`) ensures that the program efficiently narrows down the layer and computes the correct card.

### Correctness:

After analyzing the provided program and its execution summary, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic to determine the `k`-th card laid down according to the specified sequence.

**Correctness: True**
