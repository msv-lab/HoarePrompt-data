The code snippet `s += x` increments the value of `s` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `s` was 0, and `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\). Therefore, after executing the code, `s` will be equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is the result of integer division of the original `n` by 2; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\); `m` is 1; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.
