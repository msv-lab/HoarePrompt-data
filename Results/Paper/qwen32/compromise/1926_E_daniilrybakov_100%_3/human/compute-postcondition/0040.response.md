The value of `m` is multiplied by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `m` was initially 1, after the operation, `m` becomes 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is a non-zero integer and `n` is now `n // 2`; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\); `m` is 2; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**
