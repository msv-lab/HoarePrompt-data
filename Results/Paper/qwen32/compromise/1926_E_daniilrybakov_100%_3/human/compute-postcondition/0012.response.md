The code snippet provided multiplies the variable `m` by 2. Given the initial state, the value of `m` is 1. After the operation `m *= 2`, the value of `m` becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is an integer; `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\); `m` is 2; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.
