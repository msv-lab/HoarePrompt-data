To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior and termination conditions of the loop.

The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, `n` is halved, and `s` and `m` are updated based on the value of `x`, which is `(n + 1) // 2`. The loop breaks if `s < k` and `k <= s + x`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\)
   - `n` and `k` are integers from the input
   - `s` is 0
   - `m` is 1

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - `x = (n + 1) // 2`
   - `n //= 2`
   - If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the loop breaks
   - Otherwise, `s += x` and `m *= 2`

The loop will continue until `n` becomes 0 or the condition `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is met, which breaks the loop.

3. **Final State:**
   - `n` will be 0 when the loop terminates
   - `s` will be the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` values from each iteration until the loop breaks or `n` becomes 0
   - `m` will be \(2^i\) where `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed before breaking or `n` became 0
   - `k` remains unchanged
   - `t` remains unchanged

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is 0; `k` is an integer; `s` is the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` values from each iteration until the loop terminates; `m` is \(2^i\) where `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `n` will be 0, `s` will be the sum of certain values calculated in each iteration, `m` will be a power of 2 corresponding to the number of iterations, and `k` and `t` will remain unchanged.
