Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is an integer; `s` is \((\text{previous } n + 1)\); `m` is 4; `x` is \((\text{previous } n + 1) // 2\). If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the conditions remain as stated. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
