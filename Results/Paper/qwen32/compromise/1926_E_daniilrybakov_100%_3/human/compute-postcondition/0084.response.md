To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the formula in the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is `0`.
- `m` is `2` raised to the power of the number of iterations.
- `s` is the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `t` is the initial integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\).

### Analysis:
1. **Iteration Details**:
   - Since `n` is `0` initially, and `s` is the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration, we need to know the number of iterations to compute `s` accurately.
   - The problem statement does not specify the number of iterations, so let's assume there are `i` iterations for clarity.

2. **Computation of `s`**:
   - For each iteration, `s` accumulates `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - Since `n` is `0` initially, in the first iteration, `(0 + 1) // 2` is `0`.
   - If `n` remains `0` throughout all iterations, `s` will be `0` because `(0 + 1) // 2` is `0` for each iteration.

3. **Computation of `m`**:
   - `m` is `2` raised to the power of the number of iterations.
   - If there are `i` iterations, then `m = 2^i`.

4. **Formula in the Print Statement**:
   - The formula inside the `print` statement is `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - Given that `s` is `0` and `m` is `2^i`, the formula simplifies to `(2 * (k - 0) - 1) * 2^i = (2 * k - 1) * 2^i`.

### Output:
Since the exact number of iterations (`i`) and the value of `k` are not specified, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(2 * k - 1) * 2^i (where k is the second integer from the input and i is the number of iterations)**
