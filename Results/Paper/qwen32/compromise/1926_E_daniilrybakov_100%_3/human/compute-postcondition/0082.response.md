The code snippet `m *= 2` multiplies the current value of `m` by 2. Given the initial state, `m` is 4. Therefore, after executing the code, `m` becomes 8.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `x`) remain unchanged based on the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is `2 * ((n // 2 + 1) // 2) + (n // 2 + 1) // 2`; `m` is 8; `x` is `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`.**
