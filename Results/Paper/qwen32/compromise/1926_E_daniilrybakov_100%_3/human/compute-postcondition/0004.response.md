Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1.**

The variable `m` is assigned the value 1, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `s`) retain their initial values.
