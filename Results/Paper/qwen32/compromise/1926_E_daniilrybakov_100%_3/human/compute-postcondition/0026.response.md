The code multiplies the variable `m` by 2. The initial value of `m` is 4, so after executing `m *= 2`, the value of `m` becomes 8. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is an integer; `s` is \((\text{previous } n + 1) + ((\text{previous } n + 1) // 2)\); `m` is 8; `x` is \((\text{previous } n + 1) // 2\)**
