To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `i * i <= n + i` is satisfied right before the loop starts.

Given:
- `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is 0

The loop condition is `i * i <= n + i`. Substituting `i = 1` into the condition, we get:

\[ 1 * 1 \leq n + 1 \]
\[ 1 \leq n + 1 \]
\[ 0 \leq n \]

This means that for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. The value of `m` does not affect the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted such that `n` is at least 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `m` is the value returned by `func_7()`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0**
