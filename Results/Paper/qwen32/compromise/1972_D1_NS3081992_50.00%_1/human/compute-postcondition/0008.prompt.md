You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers, with b being zero in the base case of the recursion, and a being any non-negative integer in that case. In the recursive calls, a and b are the result of the modulo operation between the previous values of a and b, respectively.
def func_13(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return x, y, a
        #The program returns (1, 0, a)
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers. b is not zero. a is the result of the modulo operation between the previous values of a and b, and b is the new remainder of that operation.
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns `y`, `x`, and `g` where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, 0)`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_13` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers. If `b` is zero, the function returns the tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, the function returns the tuple `(y, x, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, 0)` in the recursive case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns (1, 0, a)

Case_2: The program returns `y`, `x`, and `g` where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, 0)`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
