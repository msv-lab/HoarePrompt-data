Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly address the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of the scenarios. The logic in the program for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the '?' characters is flawed and does not consider the constraints adequately.

Here are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Assignment Logic**: The program assigns 'F' or 'S' based on whether the index is in the first \(\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \rfloor - 1\) elements of `sa` or `sb`, which is not a reliable way to ensure the constraint is met.

2. **No Consideration of Consecutive Transitions**: The program does not check the sequence of transitions for any permutation to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) videos of the same type appear consecutively.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Undecided Videos**: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple '?' characters need to be assigned in a way that respects the constraint for all permutations.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using backtracking or dynamic programming to ensure that the constraint is met for all possible permutations of the scenarios. The provided program does not implement such an approach, making it incorrect for the given problem.
