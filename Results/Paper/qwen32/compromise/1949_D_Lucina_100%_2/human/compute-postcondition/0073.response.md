The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `a` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged except for `j`, which is incremented by 1 in the initial state but not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`x` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `a[i]` is incremented by 1.**
