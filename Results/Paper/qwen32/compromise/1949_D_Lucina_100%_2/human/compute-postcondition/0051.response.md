The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (so `j` becomes 3), and `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 3**
