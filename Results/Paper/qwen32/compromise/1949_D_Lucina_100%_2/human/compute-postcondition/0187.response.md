The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. This means that the value of `nx` will now include the character at position `xx[i][j - 1]` at the end of it. The other variables (`n`, `sa`, `i`, `j`, `xx`) remain unchanged in terms of their state description.

Output State: **`nx` is a string that now includes the character `xx[i][j - 1]` at the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` contains the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` (or both) is present in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is 'S', `j` is incremented by 1.**
