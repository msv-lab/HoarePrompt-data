To solve this problem, we need to understand the impact of the given line of code on the existing variables. Here's the given line:

```python
nx += xx[i][j - 1]
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` is 3
- `j` is 3

The variable `nx` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can assume it initially holds some value, say `nx`. The variable `xx` is also not mentioned, so we can assume it is a 2D list (or array) and `i` is an index that is not specified in the initial state.

The line of code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` means that `nx` will be updated to its current value plus the value at index `[i][j - 1]` in the 2D list `xx`. Given that `j` is 3, `j - 1` will be 2.

Since the exact values of `i` and the elements of `xx` are not provided, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `nx`. However, we can express the new value of `nx` in terms of its previous value and the element in `xx`.

Therefore, the Output State will be:
Output State: **`n` is 3, `j` is 3, `nx` is `nx + xx[i][2]`**

This means `nx` is updated to its previous value plus the value at index `[i][2]` in the 2D list `xx`.
