The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `j` to the next value it should take for the loop to continue executing.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the current value of `j` plus 1.

State: **`nx` is a string that includes either the character `xx[i][j - 1]` (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?') or 'F' or 'S' (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', depending on whether `i` or `j` (or both) are in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`). `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is incremented by 1. `j` is now the value it was at the end of the last iteration plus 1.**

To be more precise, if `j` was 1 at the start of the last iteration, it would be 2 at the start of the current iteration, and so on.

State: **`nx` is a string that includes either the character `xx[i][j - 1]` (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?') or 'F' or 'S' (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', depending on whether `i` or `j` (or both) are in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`). `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is incremented by 1. `j` is now incremented to the next value.**

Since the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`nx` is a string that includes either the character `xx[i][j - 1]` (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?') or 'F' or 'S' (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', depending on whether `i` or `j` (or both) are in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`). `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is incremented by 1. `j` is now `j + 1`.**
