Postcondition: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is []. The current index `i` is such that `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. If the condition `a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0` is not met, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged.**
