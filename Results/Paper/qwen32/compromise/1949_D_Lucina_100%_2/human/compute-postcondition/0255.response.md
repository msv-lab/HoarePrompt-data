Postcondition: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 2, `j` is 3. If `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, the program does nothing. Otherwise, a `NameError` is raised due to the undefined variable `nx`.**
