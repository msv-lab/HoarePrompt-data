The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range `1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
