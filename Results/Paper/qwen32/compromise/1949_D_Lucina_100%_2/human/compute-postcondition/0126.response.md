The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` was an empty string, and after the execution, `nx` will contain the character from `xx[i][j - 1]`. The values of `sa`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is the character `xx[i][j - 1]`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**.
