Postcondition: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], and `sb` is either [] or [3]. The length of `sa` is not less than the length of `sb`. `i` is 3 (last iteration). If `a[3]` is 0 and `b[3]` is 0, then `sb` is [3]. Otherwise, `sb` remains [].**
