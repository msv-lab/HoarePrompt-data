Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is the original `nx` with `xx[i][j - 1]` appended. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` is the original `nx` with 'F' appended if `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is the original `nx` with 'S' appended.**
