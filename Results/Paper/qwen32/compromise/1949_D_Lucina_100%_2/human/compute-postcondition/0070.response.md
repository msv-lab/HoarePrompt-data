Postcondition: **`x` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is not 'F'. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[i]` and `b[j]` are each incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b[i]` and `b[j]` remain unchanged.**
