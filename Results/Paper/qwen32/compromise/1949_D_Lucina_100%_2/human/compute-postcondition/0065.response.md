The code snippet `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. The other variables mentioned in the initial state (`x`, `n`, `xx`, `b`, `i`, `a[i]`, and the character at position `j - 1` in `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged; `a[i]` is increased by 1; the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F'; `a[j]` is increased by 1.**
