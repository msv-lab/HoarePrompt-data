To determine the output of the `print(nx)` statement, we need to understand how the string `nx` is constructed based on the given initial state. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `nx` is a string that is constructed by appending characters from `xx[n + 1]` based on specific conditions.
   - The conditions for appending characters are:
     - If `xx[n + 1][j - 1]` is not '?', append that character to `nx`.
     - If `xx[n + 1][j - 1]` is '?', append 'F' if `n + 1` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, append 'S'.

2. **Constructing `nx`**:
   - `nx` is built by iterating over each character in `xx[n + 1]` (let's denote the length of this string as `len(xx[n + 1])`).
   - For each character at position `j - 1` in `xx[n + 1]`:
     - If the character is not '?', it is directly appended to `nx`.
     - If the character is '?', the code checks if `n + 1` or `j` is in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`:
       - If either `n + 1` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, 'F' is appended to `nx`.
       - If neither `n + 1` nor `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, 'S' is appended to `nx`.

3. **Output**:
   - The final value of `nx` depends on the contents of `xx[n + 1]` and the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.
   - Since the specific values of `xx[n + 1]` and `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` are not provided, we can't determine the exact string that will be printed.

However, we can describe the construction process and the conditions that determine each character appended to `nx`:

Output: **nx (where nx is constructed by appending characters from xx[n + 1] based on the conditions: if xx[n + 1][j - 1] is not '?', append that character; if it is '?', append 'F' if n + 1 or j is in sa[:n // 4 - 1], otherwise append 'S')**
