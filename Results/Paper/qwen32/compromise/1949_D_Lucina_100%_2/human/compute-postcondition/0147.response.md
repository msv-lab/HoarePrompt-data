To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the context and the construction of the string `nx` based on the initial state provided. However, the initial state description does not provide the loop or the specific conditions used to construct the string `nx`. Without this information, we can only describe the output in a general manner based on the given variable name `nx`.

Given that `nx` is a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters according to certain conditions, the output of the `print(nx)` statement will simply be the constructed string `nx`.

Since the exact construction of `nx` is not specified in the initial state, we can't provide the exact characters that `nx` contains. However, we can describe the output as the final constructed string `nx`.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n constructed by appending characters according to the conditions specified in the loop)**
