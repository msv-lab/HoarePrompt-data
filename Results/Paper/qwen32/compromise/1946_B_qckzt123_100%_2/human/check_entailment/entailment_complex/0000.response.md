### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify whether it correctly computes the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting that sum anywhere in the array. The final result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Key Points:
1. **Sum Calculation**: The program starts by calculating the sum `s` of the array `a`.
2. **Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`)**: It then calculates the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm. This is stored in `t`.
3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The initial result `ans` is set to `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - For each subsequent operation (up to `k-1`), the maximum subarray sum `t` is doubled and added to `ans`, with results taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

#### Explanation of the Logic:
- **Sum `s`**: Adding the total sum `s` of the array ensures that we start with the base sum of the array.
- **Max Subarray Sum `t`**: Doubling the maximum subarray sum `t` in each iteration effectively simulates the process of repeatedly adding the largest possible subarray sum to the array, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the array.
- **Modulo Operation**: All operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure that the result fits within the required constraints and to match the problem's requirements.

#### Verification Against Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: For the input `[-4, -7]` and `k=2`, the maximum subarray sum is `0` (an empty subarray). The sum of the array is `-11`, and adding `0` twice doesn't change the sum, so the result is `-11 % (10^9 + 7) = 999999996`.
- **Test Case 2**: For the input `[2, 2, 8]` and `k=3`, the maximum subarray sum is `12`. The sum of the array is `12`. After three operations, the result is `12 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96`.
- **Test Case 4**: For the input `[4, -2, 8, -12, 9]` and `k=1`, the maximum subarray sum is `10` (from subarray `[4, -2, 8]`). The sum of the array is `17`, so the result is `17 + 10 = 27`.
- **Test Case 7**: For the input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` and `k=4`, the maximum subarray sum is `0`. The sum of the array is `0`, so the result is `0`.

All these test cases align with the expected outputs, indicating that the logic of the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, taking into account the constraints and requirements of the problem.

**Correctness: True**
