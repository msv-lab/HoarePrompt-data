Postcondition: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0 if `tmp` was originally less than 0, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.**
