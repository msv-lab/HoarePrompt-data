The given code snippet sets `tmp` to 0. This affects only the variable `tmp`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is `max(tmp + x, 0)`; `tmp` is 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
