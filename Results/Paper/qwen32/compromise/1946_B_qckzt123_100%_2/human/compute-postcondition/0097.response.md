The code snippet `t = max(tmp, t)` updates the value of `t` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `tmp`. Given the initial conditions, `tmp` is either 0 or remains unchanged if it was initially non-negative. Since `t` is initially 0, the new value of `t` will be `max(0, tmp)`, which means `t` will remain 0 if `tmp` is less than or equal to 0, and `t` will become `tmp` if `tmp` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is `max(0, tmp)`, `tmp` is 0 if `tmp` was initially less than 0, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + t * (2^k - 1)) % MOD, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
