To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the variables `t` and `ans` evolve with each iteration of the loop.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `k - 1` times.
- In each iteration `i`:
  - `t` is updated to `(t * 2) % MOD`.
  - `ans` is updated to `(ans + t) % MOD`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `T` ≥ 0
- `t` is the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop.
- `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums.
- `n` is the number of integers in the list `a`.
- `k` is the number of iterations (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- `a` is the list of integers.
- `MOD` is 1000000007.
- `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `ans` is initially `(s + t) % MOD`.

### Iteration Pattern:
- After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `t` becomes `2 * t % MOD` and `ans` becomes `(ans + 2 * t) % MOD`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `t` becomes `4 * t % MOD` and `ans` becomes `(ans + 4 * t) % MOD`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `t` becomes `8 * t % MOD` and `ans` becomes `(ans + 8 * t) % MOD`.

Following this pattern, after `k - 1` iterations:
- `t` will be `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`.
- `ans` will be `(s + t + 2 * t + 4 * t + ... + 2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`.

### Summation of Geometric Series:
The series `t + 2 * t + 4 * t + ... + 2^(k-1) * t` is a geometric series with the first term `a = t` and common ratio `r = 2`. The sum of the first `k` terms of a geometric series is given by:

\[ S_k = t \cdot \frac{2^k - 1}{2 - 1} = t \cdot (2^k - 1) \]

Thus, the final `ans` will be:

\[ ans = (s + t \cdot (2^k - 1)) \% MOD \]

### Final Output State:
- `T` remains ≥ 0.
- `t` becomes `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`.
- `tmp` remains the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums.
- `n`, `k`, `a`, `MOD`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- `ans` becomes `(s + t * (2^k - 1)) % MOD`.

### Final Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + t * (2^k - 1)) % MOD`.**

In natural language, after all iterations, `t` is updated to be the maximum value of `tmp` multiplied by `2^(k-1)` and taken modulo `MOD`. The final answer `ans` is the sum of `s` and `t` multiplied by `(2^k - 1)`, also taken modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
