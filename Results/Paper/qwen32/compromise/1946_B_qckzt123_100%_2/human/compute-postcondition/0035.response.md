The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is `((2 times the maximum subarray sum of `a`) % 1000000007) * 2 % 1000000007`; `tmp` is 0; `n` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer read from input where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t`; `i` is 2**
