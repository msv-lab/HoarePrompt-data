The code snippet `t = max(tmp, t)` updates the value of `t` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `tmp`. Given the initial state, `t` was already defined as `max(tmp + x, 0)`, and `tmp` is adjusted based on whether it is less than 0 or not.

Since `t` was initially set to `max(tmp + x, 0)`, and now it is being updated to `max(tmp, t)`, we need to consider the possible scenarios:

- If `tmp + x` was greater than or equal to 0, then `t` was initially `tmp + x`. In this case, `max(tmp, tmp + x)` would be `tmp + x` because `tmp + x` is greater than or equal to `tmp`.
- If `tmp + x` was less than 0, then `t` was initially 0. In this case, `max(tmp, 0)` would be 0 if `tmp` is also less than 0, or `tmp` if `tmp` is non-negative.

Therefore, the new value of `t` will be the maximum of `tmp` and the previous value of `t`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is `max(tmp, max(tmp + x, 0))`; `tmp` is 0 if `tmp < 0`, otherwise `tmp` remains `tmp + x`; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
