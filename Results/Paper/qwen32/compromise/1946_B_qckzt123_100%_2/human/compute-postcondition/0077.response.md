The code snippet `t %= MOD` modifies the value of `t` by taking its modulus with `MOD`. Given that `t` is already defined as `(the maximum value of tmp encountered during the loop multiplied by 8) % MOD`, applying the modulus operation again does not change its value since `t` is already within the range `[0, MOD-1]`.

Thus, the value of `t` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is (the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop multiplied by 8) % MOD, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + 3 * t) % MOD`, `i` is `i + 2`**
