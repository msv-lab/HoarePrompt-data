The given code snippet is `tmp += x`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the exact new value of `tmp` without knowing what `x` is.

Given the lack of definition for `x`, I'll assume the task intends for us to treat `x` as an undefined variable whose value is not specified. In such a case, the best we can do is express the new state of `tmp` in terms of `x`.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `tmp` is `tmp + x`, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`**. 

In simpler terms, `tmp` is now `tmp` plus `x`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
