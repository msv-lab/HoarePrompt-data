The code snippet `tmp += x` updates the value of `tmp` by adding `x` to it. Given that `x` is defined as `a[j]`, the next element in the list `a`, the new value of `tmp` will be `tmp + a[j]`. 

If `tmp + a[j]` is less than 0, `tmp` will be reset to 0 according to the initial state description. Otherwise, `tmp` will remain as `tmp + a[j]`.

The other variables (`T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `MOD`, `s`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is `max(tmp, max(tmp + a[j], 0))`; `tmp` is `max(0, tmp + a[j])`; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `x` is `a[j]`, the next element in the list `a`.**
