The given code snippet is `tmp += x`. However, there is no variable `x` defined in the initial state. Given the context, it seems like there might be a mistake or missing information since `x` is not part of the initial state provided.

Since the task is to adhere strictly to the given initial state and the provided code, and since `x` is not defined, we cannot perform the operation `tmp += x`. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + t * (2^k - 1)) % MOD`**.
