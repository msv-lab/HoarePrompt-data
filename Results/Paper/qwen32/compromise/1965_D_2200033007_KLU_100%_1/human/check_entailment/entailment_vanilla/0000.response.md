To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze each function and see if they collectively solve the problem as described.

### Function Analysis

1. **`func_1(a)`**: This function generates all possible subarray sums of an array `a`. It iterates through all possible starting points `i` and ending points `j` of subarrays, calculates their sums, and stores them in a list `cts`. Finally, it sorts the list of subarray sums and returns it. This function works correctly for generating and sorting subarray sums.

2. **`func_2(cts)`**: This function takes a sorted list of subarray sums (`cts`) and removes duplicates by maintaining a list `odds`. If a sum appears twice consecutively, it is removed (indicating that it is not the missing subarray sum). This function works correctly under the assumption that the input list `cts` is sorted and contains all subarray sums except one.

3. **`func_3(odds, n)`**: This function reconstructs the original array `a` from the list of unique subarray sums (`odds`). It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros and fills it by calculating the differences between consecutive sums in `odds`. The differences are divided by 2 because the array is a palindrome, and the same value appears symmetrically on both sides. This function assumes that the list `odds` contains the correct unique subarray sums to reconstruct the array.

4. **`func_4(bigList, smallList)`**: This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists: `bigList` (which contains all subarray sums including the missing one) and `smallList` (which contains all subarray sums except the missing one). It removes matching elements from the end of both lists until they no longer match, and then returns the last element of `bigList`, which is the missing subarray sum. However, this function is not used in the main logic of the program provided.

### Main Logic

The main logic of the program involves:
- Generating all subarray sums of a hypothetical array `a` using `func_1`.
- Identifying the unique subarray sums (excluding the missing one) using `func_2`.
- Reconstructing the array `a` from these unique subarray sums using `func_3`.

However, the program does not actually generate all subarray sums of a hypothetical array `a` to identify the missing subarray sum. Instead, it directly processes the given list of subarray sums (excluding one) to reconstruct the array. Here's how the program should work:

1. Sort the given list of subarray sums.
2. Use `func_2` to remove duplicate sums, leaving the unique sums.
3. Use `func_3` to reconstruct the array from these unique sums.

The key point is that the program assumes the given list of subarray sums (excluding one) is already sorted and contains all necessary information to reconstruct the array.

### Conclusion

Given the problem constraints and the provided functions, the program should work correctly if the input list of subarray sums is processed as intended. Since the problem guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution, and the program follows a logical approach to reconstruct the array, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
