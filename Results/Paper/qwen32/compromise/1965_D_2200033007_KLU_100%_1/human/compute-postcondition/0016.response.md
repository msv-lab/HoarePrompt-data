Postcondition: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least one element; `n` is an integer representing the length of the palindrome array `a` such that 3 <= n <= 1000; `prev` is `x`; `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`; `x` is the next element in the list `odds`. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is now `x` and the rest of the conditions regarding the elements of `a` remain as described. Otherwise, `a[(n + 1) // 2]` is `(x - prev) // 2`, `a[idx]` is `x // 2`, and `a[n - 1 - idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`, with all other elements of `a` being 0.**
