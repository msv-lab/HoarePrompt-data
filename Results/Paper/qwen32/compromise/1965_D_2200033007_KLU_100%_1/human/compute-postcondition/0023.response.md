Postcondition: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least one element; `n` is an integer representing the length of the palindrome array `a` such that 3 <= n <= 1000; `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`; `x` is the next element in the list `odds`. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is `x`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`. All other elements of `a` remain as described in the initial state.**
