Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is -inf, `k` is -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined, `max_diff` is equal to `diff` (where `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`), `next_max_diff` is less than `diff`, `index` is 1.**

In this output state, the variable `index` has been updated to the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
