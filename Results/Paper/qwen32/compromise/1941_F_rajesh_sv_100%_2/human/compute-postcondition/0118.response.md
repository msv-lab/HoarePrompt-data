Functionality: **The function `func_6` accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of prepared problems, the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively. It also accepts three lists: `A` (sorted in ascending order) of length `n` representing the complexities of the prepared problems, `D` (sorted and containing unique elements) of length `m` representing the complexities of the models, and `F` of length `k` representing the complexities of the functions. The function returns an output based on these inputs, but the specific output conditions and logic are not detailed here.**
