The value of `testcases` is reassigned to the return value of `func_3()`. The previous value of `testcases` (a positive integer representing the number of test cases) is replaced by whatever value `func_3()` returns. The output state includes this new value for `testcases`.

Output State: **`testcases` is the return value of `func_3()`**.
