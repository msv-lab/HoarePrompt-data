The code snippet assigns the values of `A[index - 1]` and `A[index]` to the variables `left` and `right`, respectively. This does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, or `index`. The only changes are the assignments to `left` and `right`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` remains unchanged, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`.**
