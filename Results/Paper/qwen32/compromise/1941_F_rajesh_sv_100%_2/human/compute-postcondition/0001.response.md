The only variable in the loop head is `testcases`, which is the return value of `func_3()`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `testcases` must be a value that is greater than or equal to 1. The loop will iterate `testcases` times, so if `testcases` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

State: **`testcases` is the return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than or equal to 1**
