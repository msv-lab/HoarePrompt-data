Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` remains None, `next_max_diff` is -inf.**

Natural language: The variable `next_max_diff` is updated to the value of `max_diff`, which is -inf. All other variables retain their initial values.
