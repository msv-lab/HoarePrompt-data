Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` is a list that must have at least two elements, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` using `bisect_right`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `D` must have at least two elements, `F` is a list that must have at least two elements, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the next element in `F`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`, and `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum`. In both cases, `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `D` must have at least two elements, `F` is a list that must have at least two elements, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `D` must have at least two elements, `F` is a list that must have at least two elements, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2` (before the update to `l` or `h`), `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
