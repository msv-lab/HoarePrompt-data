The code snippet calculates the midpoint `mid` between `l` and `h`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `mid`, which is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` is a list that must have at least one element, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`; `ans` is equal to `max_diff`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**
