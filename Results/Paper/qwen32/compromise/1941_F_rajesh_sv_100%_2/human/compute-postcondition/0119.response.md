Functionality: **The function `func_6` calculates and prints the maximum of two values: the second largest difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `A` (representing complexities of prepared problems), and a computed value `ans` which is the minimum of the initial maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A` and values derived from the complexities of models in `D` and functions in `F`.**
