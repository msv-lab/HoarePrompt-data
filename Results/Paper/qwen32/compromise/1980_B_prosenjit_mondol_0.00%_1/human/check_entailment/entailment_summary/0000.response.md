### Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic of the program to ensure it correctly determines whether Dmitry's favorite cube is removed based on the given conditions.

1. **Input Parsing and Adjustment**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k`.
   - The value of `f` and `k` are decremented by 1 to convert them to 0-based indexing, which is standard in Python.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The value of the favorite cube `x` is stored.
   - The program then checks the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list:
     - If `a[k] > x`, it means that the `k`-th largest cube has a higher value than the favorite cube, so the favorite cube is not among the first `k` largest cubes, and it is not removed. Hence, the output is 'NO'.
     - If `a[k] < x`, it means that the `k`-th largest cube has a lower value than the favorite cube, so the favorite cube is among the first `k` largest cubes and is removed. Hence, the output is 'YES'.
     - If `a[k] == x`, it means that the `k`-th largest cube has the same value as the favorite cube. In this case, the program checks if:
       - `k == n - 1`, meaning all cubes except the last one are considered for removal. Since the `k`-th cube is the last one, it means the favorite cube is not removed, so the output is 'YES'.
       - `a[k - 1] < x`, meaning the cube right before the `k`-th cube in the sorted list has a lower value, so the favorite cube is among the first `k` largest cubes and is removed. Hence, the output is 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it means there are other cubes with the same value as the favorite cube, and it is uncertain whether the favorite cube is among the first `k` largest cubes or not. Hence, the output is 'MAYBE'.

Given this logic, the program correctly handles all the possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
