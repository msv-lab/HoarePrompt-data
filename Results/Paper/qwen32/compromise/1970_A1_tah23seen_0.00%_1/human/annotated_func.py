    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which is the same as the string `s`, a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and guarantees it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns the same string `s` unchanged.
