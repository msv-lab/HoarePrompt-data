Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.

The optimal strategy involves splitting the array such that the sum of each subarray is zero, which minimizes the penalty. The provided function does not consider any splitting strategy and simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.
