Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` only calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not address the problem of splitting the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The given program does not implement any logic to split the array into subarrays and instead calculates a single value based on the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

Let's re-examine the annotated code with this in mind:

1. **State before function call**: `expression` is a string of '+' and '-', and `length` is the length of `expression`.
2. **Inside `func_1`**:
   - `count` is the number of '+' characters in `expression`.
   - `sub` is the number of '-' characters in `expression` (calculated as `length - count`).
   - The function returns `abs(sub - count)`, which is the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

The annotations confirm that the function simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which does not align with the problem's requirement to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

The example provided in the original assessment also highlights the discrepancy:
- For the test case `+-+-+-`, the correct output is `0` because the array can be split into subarrays with zero penalty. However, the provided program outputs `2`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
