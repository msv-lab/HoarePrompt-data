Postcondition: **`iterations` must be one more than the number of completed iterations, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `y` is set to `a`. If `a` is greater than the original `y`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
