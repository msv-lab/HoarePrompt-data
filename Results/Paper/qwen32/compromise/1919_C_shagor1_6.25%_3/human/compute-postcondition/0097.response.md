The variable `y` is assigned the value of `a`. The values of the other variables (`iterations`, `n`, `inp`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`iterations` is one more than the number of completed iterations, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 more element, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `y` is equal to `a`.**
