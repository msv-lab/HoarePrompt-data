The code snippet `*inp, = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `inp`. This operation overwrites the previous value of `inp` with the new input values. The variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` are not directly affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest unique element in `inp` (or the same as `x` if all elements are the same), `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.**
