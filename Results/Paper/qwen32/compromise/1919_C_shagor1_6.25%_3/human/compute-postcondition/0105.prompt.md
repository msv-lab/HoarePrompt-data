Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    *inp, = map(int, input().split())
    x = y = n + 1
    ans = 0
    for a in inp:
        if a <= x:
            x = a
        elif a <= y:
            y = a
        else:
            x == y
            y = a
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest unique element in `inp` (or the same as `x` if all elements are the same), `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: 

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: iterations: n + 1, n: input integer, inp: list of integers from the input, x: smallest element in inp, y: second smallest element in inp, ans: count of elements greater than both x and y.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
