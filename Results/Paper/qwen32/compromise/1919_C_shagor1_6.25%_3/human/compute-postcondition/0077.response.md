Output State: **`iterations` must be one more than the number of completed iterations, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `x` is equal to `a`, `y` is equal to `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, and `a` is less than or equal to `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to `a`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
