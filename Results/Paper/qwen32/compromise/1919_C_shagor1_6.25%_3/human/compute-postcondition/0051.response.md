Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element. If `a` is less than or equal to `x` (where `x` is `n + 1`), then `x` remains `a` and `y` is `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than `x`, then `x` is `n + 1` and `y` is `a`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.**
