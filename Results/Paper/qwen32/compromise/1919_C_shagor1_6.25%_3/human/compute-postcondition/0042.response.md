The value of `x` is updated to be equal to `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `x` is equal to `a`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, and `a` is less than or equal to `x`.
