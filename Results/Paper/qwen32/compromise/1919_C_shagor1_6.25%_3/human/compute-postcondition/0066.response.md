Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `a` is the next element in `inp` (the successor of the current `a` in the list), and `y` is equal to `a`. If `a` is greater than `y` before the if-else statement, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
