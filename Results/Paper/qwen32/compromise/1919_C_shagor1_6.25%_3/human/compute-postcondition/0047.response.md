The code snippet provided is `x == y`. This is a comparison operation and does not change the values of `x` or `y`. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain unchanged after the execution of this line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, and `a` is greater than `y`.**
