### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to generate a checkerboard pattern of size `2n x 2n` for a series of test cases. The pattern alternates between `#` and `.` in a 2x2 block pattern, starting with `#` in the top-left corner.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. Then, for each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
2. **Pattern Generation**: The program has hardcoded patterns for `n = 1`, `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`. These patterns are printed directly.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` is not one of the hardcoded values (i.e., greater than 4), the program prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in range" in Spanish).

### Issues:

- **Hardcoded Patterns**: The program only handles specific values of `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4). It does not handle any other values of `n` within the specified range (1 to 20). This means the program is incorrect for `n > 4`.
- **Output Requirement**: The problem statement specifies that the program should output the checkerboard pattern for each test case without any additional messages (like "No esta en el rango").

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program is not correct for the entire range of possible input values (1 to 20). Therefore, the program needs to be modified to handle all possible values of `n` within the specified range.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: False**

The program does not correctly handle all possible values of `n` within the given range and outputs an incorrect message for `n > 4`.
