Output State: **`t` is 2; `x` is an input integer that has been modified based on its parity and is not equal to 1. If the original `x` was even, `x` is now `x / 2 - 1`, `max` is 99999998`, `min` is -99999998`, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, -99999999]. If the original `x` was odd, `x` is now `x - 2`, `max` is 100000000`, `min` is -99999997`, and `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999, -99999998].**

In simpler terms: `t` remains 2. If the original `x` was even, `x` is now `x / 2 - 1`. If the original `x` was odd, `x` is now `x - 2`. The values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
