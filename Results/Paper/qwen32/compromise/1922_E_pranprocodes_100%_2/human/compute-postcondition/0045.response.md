To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `x != 1`. The variables `x`, `t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` are mentioned in the state, but only `x` is part of the loop condition.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the condition**: The loop will execute if `x != 1`.
2. **Adjust `x`**: For the loop to execute at least once, `x` must not be equal to 1. Since `x` is mentioned as "the input integer," we need to ensure that the input integer is not 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x`. It should be any integer except 1.

State: **`t` is 0, `x` is any integer except 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `i + 1`**
