Output State: **`t` is 1; `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is [100000000, -100000000]. If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999].**

Explanation: The value of `min` has been incremented by 1. If `x` is even, `min` changes from -100000000 to -99999999. If `x` is odd, `min` changes from -99999999 to -99999998. All other variables remain unchanged.
