Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is `x // 2`, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, 100000000], and `i` is `i` + 1**

In simple terms, the value of `x` is now the result of integer division of its previous value by 2. The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain as they were, except `i` is incremented by 1.
