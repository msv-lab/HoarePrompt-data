Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is any integer except 1, `max` is either 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is either [100000000, max, max], [-100000000, max, max], [100000000, min, max], or [-100000000, min, max], and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `max` is decremented by 1. The value of `max` can now be 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
