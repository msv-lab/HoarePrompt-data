The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is any integer except 1, which means the loop can certainly execute one more time without any adjustment.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is 2, `x` is any integer except 1, `max` is either 99999998, 99999999, or 100000000, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is either [100000000, max], [-100000000, max], [100000000, min], or [-100000000, min], and `i` is `i + 1`**
