Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` must be greater than 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` (before modification) was odd, 99999998 if `x` (before modification) was even, `min` is -99999998 if `x` (before modification) was odd, -99999997 if `x` (before modification) was even, `ans` is [100000000, -99999999, -99999999] if `x` (after modification) is odd, [100000000, 99999999, -99999998] if `x` (after modification) is even, and `i` is `i` + 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if `x` was initially odd, it is now even, and if it was initially even, it is now odd. The values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` are adjusted based on the new parity of `x`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is incremented by 1.
