The value of `min` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0; `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 1; `max` is 100000000; `min` is -99999999; `ans` is [-100000000]; `x` is an odd integer.
Output State: **`t` is 0; `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 1; `max` is 100000000; `min` is -99999999; `ans` is [-100000000]; `x` is an odd integer.**
