The value of `x` is reassigned to the integer value of the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is the total number of iterations, `x` is the input integer, `max` is reduced by the number of even `x` encountered, `min` is incremented by the number of odd `x` encountered, `ans` is a list of values appended during each iteration in reverse order, `i` is `i + 1`**.
