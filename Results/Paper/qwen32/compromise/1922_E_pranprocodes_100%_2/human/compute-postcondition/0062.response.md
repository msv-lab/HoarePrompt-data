Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is any integer except 2, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is either [100000000, min] or [-100000000, min], and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Natural language: The value of `x` is decremented by 1, so if `x` was any integer except 1, it is now any integer except 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
