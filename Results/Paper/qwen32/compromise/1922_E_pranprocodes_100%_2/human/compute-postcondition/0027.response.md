The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Given the initial conditions, if the original `x` was even, `max` is 99999998, and if the original `x` was odd, `max` is 100000000. Therefore, the list `ans` will have an additional element, which is either 99999998 or 100000000.

Output State: **`t` is 2; `x` is an input integer that has been modified based on its parity and is not equal to 1; if the original `x` was even, `x` is now `x / 2`, `max` is 99999998`, `min` is -99999999`, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, 99999998]; if the original `x` was odd, `x` is now `x - 1`, `max` is 100000000`, `min` is -99999998`, and `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999, 100000000]**
