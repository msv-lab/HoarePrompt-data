Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is any integer except 1 and `x` is even, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [-100000000], `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1, making it an even number since it was initially an odd integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
