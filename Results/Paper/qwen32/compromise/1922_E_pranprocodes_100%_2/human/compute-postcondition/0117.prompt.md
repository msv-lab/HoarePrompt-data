Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    max = 100000000
    min = -100000000
    ans = []
    t = 0
    while x != 1:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            ans.append(max)
            max -= 1
            x = x // 2
        else:
            ans.append(min)
            min += 1
            x -= 1
        t += 1
    ans.reverse()
    print(t)
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the total number of iterations, `x` is 1, `max` is reduced by the number of even `x` encountered, `min` is incremented by the number of odd `x` encountered, and `ans` is a list of values appended during each iteration in reverse order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the number of iterations needed to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is 1, `max` is the initial max value minus the number of even `x` values encountered, `min` is the initial min value plus the number of odd `x` values encountered, `ans` is a reversed list of `max` and `min` values corresponding to each iteration, and `i` is `i` + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the total number of iterations, `x` is 1, `max` and `min` are adjusted based on the sequence of even and odd values `x` took, `ans` is the list of `max` and `min` values appended during each iteration but in reverse order, and `i` is `i` + 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
