Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is any integer except 1, `max` is either 99999998, 99999999, or 100000000, `min` is either -99999998 or -99999997, `ans` is either [100000000, max, min], [-100000000, max, min], [100000000, min, min], or [-100000000, min, min], and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `min` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. If `min` was -99999999, it is now -99999998. If `min` was -99999998, it is now -99999997. The value of `ans` will reflect the new value of `min` in its third position.
