Postcondition: **`t` is 2; `x` is an input integer that has been modified based on its parity and is not equal to 1. If the original `x` was even, `x` is now `(x / 2) // 2` if `x % 2 == 0`, or `x / 2 - 1` otherwise; `max` is 99999997` if `x % 2 == 0`, or `99999998` otherwise; `min` is -99999999` if `x % 2 == 0`, or `-99999998` otherwise; and `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999, 99999998]` if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 == 0`, `[100000000, 99999999, -99999999]` if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 != 0`, `[-100000000, -99999999, 100000000]` if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 == 0`, or `[-100000000, -99999999, -99999998]` if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 != 0`. If the original `x` was odd, `x` is now `((x - 1) // 2)` if `x % 2 == 0`, or `x - 2` otherwise; `max` is 100000000` if `x % 2 == 0`, or `100000000` otherwise; `min` is -99999999` if `x % 2 == 0`, or `-99999997` otherwise; and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, 100000000]` if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 == 0`, or `[-100000000, -99999999, -99999998]` if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 != 0`.**
