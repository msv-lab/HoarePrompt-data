To determine the output state, we need to consider the initial state and the impact of the line `ans.append(max)` on the variables.

Initial State:
- `t` is 2
- `x` must be greater than 2
- `max` is 99999998 if `x` (after modification) is even, 99999999 if `x` (before modification) was odd, 100000000 if `x` (before modification) was even
- `min` is -99999999 if `x` (after modification) is odd, -99999998 if `x` (before modification) was even, -100000000 if `x` (before modification) was odd
- `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` was even, [100000000, -99999999] if `x` was odd and `x` (before modification) was even, [-100000000, 100000000] if `x` was even and `x` (before modification) was odd, [-100000000, -100000000] if `x` was odd and `x` (before modification) was odd
- `i` is `i` + 1

The line `ans.append(max)` appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. The value of `max` depends on the parity of `x` before modification.

Let's break down the possibilities for `x`:
- If `x` (before modification) is even, `max` is 100000000.
- If `x` (before modification) is odd, `max` is 99999999.

Since `x` must be greater than 2, let's consider both cases:

1. If `x` (before modification) is even:
   - `max` is 100000000
   - `ans` is initially [100000000, 99999999] or [100000000, -99999999] or [-100000000, 100000000] or [-100000000, -100000000]
   - After `ans.append(max)`, `ans` becomes [100000000, 99999999, 100000000] or [100000000, -99999999, 100000000] or [-100000000, 100000000, 100000000] or [-100000000, -100000000, 100000000]
   
2. If `x` (before modification) is odd:
   - `max` is 99999999
   - `ans` is initially [100000000, 99999999] or [100000000, -99999999] or [-100000000, 100000000] or [-100000000, -100000000]
   - After `ans.append(max)`, `ans` becomes [100000000, 99999999, 99999999] or [100000000, -99999999, 99999999] or [-100000000, 100000000, 99999999] or [-100000000, -100000000, 99999999]

Since the exact parity of `x` (before modification) is not specified, we can summarize the possible values of `ans` after the append operation.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` must be greater than 2, `max` is 99999998 if `x` (after modification) is even, 99999999 if `x` (before modification) was odd, 100000000 if `x` (before modification) was even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` (after modification) is odd, -99999998 if `x` (before modification) was even, -100000000 if `x` (before modification) was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, 100000000] or [100000000, -99999999, 100000000] or [-100000000, 100000000, 100000000] or [-100000000, -100000000, 100000000] or [100000000, 99999999, 99999999] or [100000000, -99999999, 99999999] or [-100000000, 100000000, 99999999] or [-100000000, -100000000, 99999999], `i` is `i` + 1**
