Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is decreased by 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` (before decrement) is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998 if `x` (before decrement) is even, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is `[100000000, -99999999]` if `x` (before decrement) is even, otherwise `ans` is `[-100000000, -100000000]`, and `i` is `i` + 1.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `x` is decreased by 1. The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain as per their initial state descriptions, with `x` now being one less than its initial value.
