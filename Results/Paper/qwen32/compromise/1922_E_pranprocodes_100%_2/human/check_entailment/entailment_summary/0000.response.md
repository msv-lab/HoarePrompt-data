Reasoning:  
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by reducing the given number of increasing subsequences `X` to 1 through a series of operations that append either a maximum or minimum value to a list based on the parity of `X`. However, the logic used in the program does not correctly generate an array that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Approach to Constructing the Array**: The program attempts to construct an array by appending either a maximum or minimum value based on whether `X` is even or odd. However, this does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences is influenced by the specific values and their order in the array, not just the count of operations.

2. **Lack of Proper Construction Logic**: The problem requires constructing an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. This involves carefully choosing values and their order to create the desired number of subsequences. The provided program does not implement this logic correctly.

3. **No Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where it is impossible to construct such an array (e.g., when `X` is not a power of 2 or cannot be represented by a valid combination of increasing subsequences).

4. **Incorrect Output Format**: The program outputs the length of the operations list and the list itself, which may not correspond to a valid array that meets the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
