Output State: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `cn` is 1; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the first character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is 1; `r` is 1; `n` is the length of the input list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `symb1 = num[0]` assigns the first character of the string `num` to the variable `symb1`. Since `symb2` was already set to the first character of `num` in the initial state, it remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.
