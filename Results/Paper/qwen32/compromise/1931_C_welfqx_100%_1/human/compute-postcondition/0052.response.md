The code snippet provided increments the variable `ck` by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 1 and `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Since `ck` is not mentioned in the initial state, we will assume it has some value prior to the operation. After executing the code, `ck` will be increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `ck` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
