The code snippet `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. However, `cn` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its previous value. Therefore, we can only state that `cn` has been incremented by 1.

The other variables (`f`, `onum`, `n`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `i`, `ck`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `n` is at least 5, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `i` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is increased by 1.**
