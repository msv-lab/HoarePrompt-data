Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ck` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, up to `n-1` if all elements are equal. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is increased by `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged. `r` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `f` is 1; `num` is a list of integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1):
    if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
        f = 0
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 2, `j` is 0. If the element at index `j` of `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1`, then `f` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `f` and the loop or if statement does not break.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, `f` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `f` and we do not break out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 3 and `j` is 2. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, then `f` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to `f` or the loop/condition is not broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
