The code snippet provided reverses the list `onum`. The reversal of the list does not affect any other variables except `onum` itself. Given the initial state, `onum` is a copy of `num`, so reversing `onum` will result in a list that is the reverse of `num`.

Output State: **`f` is 1 if all consecutive elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `cn` is `2 * n` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise `cn` is `n`; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the first character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is `n`; `r` is 1; `n` is the length of the input list. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1.**
