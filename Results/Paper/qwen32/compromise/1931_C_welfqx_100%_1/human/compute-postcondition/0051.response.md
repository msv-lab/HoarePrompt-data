The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ii` and `n`. If `ii` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is at a value such that the loop condition `ii < n - 1` was true, and now `ii` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must still be less than `n - 1`.

Given that `n` is greater than 1, and assuming the loop just finished an iteration where `ii` was some value `x`, then at the start of the next iteration, `ii` will be `x + 1`. For the loop to continue, `x + 1` must be less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, `ii` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
