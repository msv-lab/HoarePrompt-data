Postcondition: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `n` is at least 5, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `i` is 5, `ck` is 1. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
