The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `ck` remains 1. Since `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4. For the loop to continue, `n` must be at least 5 (since `i` must be less than `n - 1`).

State: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `n` is at least 5, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `i` is 4, `ck` is 1**
