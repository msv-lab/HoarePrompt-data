Postcondition: **`f` is 0 if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, otherwise `f` remains 1. `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`. `cn` is `2 * n` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise `cn` is `n`. `symb1` is the first character of `num`. `symb2` is the first character of `onum`. `ii` is `n - 1`. `ck` is `n`. `r` is 1. `num` is a list of integers from the input. `n` is greater than or equal to 2. `j` is `n - 2`. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
