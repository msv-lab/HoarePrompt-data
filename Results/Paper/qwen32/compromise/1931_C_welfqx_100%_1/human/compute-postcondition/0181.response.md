Postcondition: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the last character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 2`; `r` is 1; `n` is at least 2. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is 2. Otherwise, `ck` is 1.**
