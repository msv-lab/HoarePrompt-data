Output State: **f is 1, and n can be any value such that either n equals 1 or f equals 1. The current value of f is 1. and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The values of the variables `f` and `n` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of the loop will be terminated early, and the loop will proceed to the next iteration.
