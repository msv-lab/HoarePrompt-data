Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is `i` (where the loop broke), `f` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `i` is 0, and `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The loop broke at `i`, so `j` is set to `i`. All other variables retain their initial values as the `break` statement does not affect them.
