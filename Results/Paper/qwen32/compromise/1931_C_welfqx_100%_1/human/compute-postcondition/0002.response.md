Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input, while `t`, `r`, and the properties of `a` remain unchanged.
