The `break` statement in the given code snippet will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `j`, or `f`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `f` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
