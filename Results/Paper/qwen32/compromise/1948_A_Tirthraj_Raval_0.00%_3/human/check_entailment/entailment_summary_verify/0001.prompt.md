You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of length `n` consisting of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, starting with 'A'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step:

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- There must be exactly `n` special characters in this string.
- A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- For each test case, we need to either print "NO" if it's impossible to construct such a string, or print "YES" followed by a suitable string.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Case**:
   - If `n` is odd, the program correctly prints "NO". This is because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors (which would require pairs of such characters).

3. **Even `n` Case**:
   - If `n` is even, the program prints "YES" and then constructs a string.
   - The construction process involves alternating pairs of 'A' and 'B'. For example, for `n = 6`, the pattern would be "ABABAB".

4. **Special Character Count**:
   - In the constructed pattern "ABABAB", every character (except the first and last) is special because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - For `n = 6`, the special characters are at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (considering 1-based indexing), which matches the requirement.

### Verification:
- The pattern "ABABAB" for `n = 6` correctly has 6 special characters.
- The pattern for `n = 2` would be "AB", which has 2 special characters.
- The pattern for `n = 4` would be "ABAB", which has 4 special characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and constructs a valid string when possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and constructs a valid string when possible.
Correctness: **True**
