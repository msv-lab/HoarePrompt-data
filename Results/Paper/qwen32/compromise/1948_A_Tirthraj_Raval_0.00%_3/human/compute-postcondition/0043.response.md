The code snippet appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can assume that `i` is some integer. The expression `'AB'[i % 2]` will evaluate to 'A' if `i % 2` is 0 (i.e., `i` is even), and 'B' if `i % 2` is 1 (i.e., `i` is odd). The initial state specifies that `pattern` is an empty list, and this list will now contain one element, either 'A' or 'B'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that \(0 < t \leq 50\); `n` must be at least 2; `pattern` is a list containing either ['A'] or ['B'].**
