To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

- `t` is an integer input by the user such that \(0 < t \leq 50\). However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `pattern` is a list of length `n` (or `n-1` if `n` is odd) containing the alternating sequence of 'A' and 'B'. This implies that the list `pattern` will have an alternating sequence of 'A' and 'B' characters.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(''.join(pattern))
```
This statement will concatenate all the elements of the `pattern` list into a single string and print it.

Let's consider the possible lengths of `pattern`:
- If `n` is even, `pattern` will have `n` elements: 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', ..., 'A', 'B'.
- If `n` is odd, `pattern` will have `n` elements: 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', ..., 'A'.

Thus, the output will be an alternating sequence of 'A' and 'B' characters with a length of `n`.

Output: **An alternating sequence of 'A' and 'B' characters of length `n`**
