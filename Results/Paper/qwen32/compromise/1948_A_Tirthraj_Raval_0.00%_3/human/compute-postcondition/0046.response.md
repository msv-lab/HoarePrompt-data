Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that \(0 < t \leq 50\); `n` must be greater than 2 * (`i + 1`); `pattern` is a list containing either ['A', 'B'] or ['B', 'A'] with an additional 'A' or 'B' appended depending on the value of `i`; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The `pattern` list has an additional element appended to it, which is either 'A' or 'B' based on the value of `i % 2`. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1. All other conditions remain the same.
