The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only say that `pattern` will have one additional element, which will be either 'A' or 'B'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an even integer and at least 2; `pattern` is a list with one additional element, either 'A' or 'B'**.
