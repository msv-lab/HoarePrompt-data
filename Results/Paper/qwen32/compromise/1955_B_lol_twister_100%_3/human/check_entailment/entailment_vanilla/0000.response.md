### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to verify its correctness.

1. **Understanding the Progressive Square Construction:**
   - The progressive square is an `n x n` matrix.
   - It starts with a value `a_{1,1}` at the top-left corner.
   - Each subsequent element in the same row is increased by `c`.
   - Each subsequent element in the same column is increased by `d`.

2. **Determining `a_{1,1}`:**
   - The smallest element in the array `l` is taken as `a_{1,1}` because it logically should be the starting point of the progressive square.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square:**
   - Using the determined `a_{1,1}`, the progressive square is generated by iterating through each position `(k, h)` in the `n x n` matrix.
   - The value at position `(k, h)` is calculated as `a_{1,1} + k * c + h * d`.

4. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - Both the generated progressive square (`li`) and the input array (`l`) are sorted.
   - If they match after sorting, it means the input array can indeed form the progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.

5. **Implementation Details:**
   - The function `func_1` takes `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l` as inputs.
   - It determines `a_{1,1}` as the minimum value in `l`.
   - It generates the progressive square using nested loops and stores the results in `li`.
   - Both `li` and `l` are sorted and compared.
   - The function returns `'yes'` if they match, otherwise `'no'`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles multiple test cases efficiently within the constraints.
   - It correctly identifies whether the given array can form the progressive square based on the provided rules.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given array can form a progressive square based on the rules specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

**Correctness: True**
