To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it modifies the list `li`.

The loop runs `n` times, as indicated by `for h in range(0, n):`. During each iteration, the loop appends a new element to the list `li` based on the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, where `h` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. The loop runs `n` times, so `h` will take on values from 0 to `n-1`.
2. For each value of `h`, the expression `a + k * c + d * h` is computed and appended to `li`.
3. After `n` iterations, `li` will contain `n` elements, each corresponding to a different value of `h`.

Thus, the final state of `li` will be a list of `n` elements, where the `i-th` element is given by `a + k * c + d * i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

Given the initial conditions and the nature of the loop, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n` elements where the `i-th` element is `a + k * c + d * i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `li` will have `n` elements, each calculated using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` with `h` taking values from 0 to `n-1`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
