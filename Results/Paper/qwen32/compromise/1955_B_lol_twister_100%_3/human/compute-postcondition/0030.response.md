Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a sorted list containing `n^2` elements where the `i-th` element is `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and `l` is equal to `li`.**
