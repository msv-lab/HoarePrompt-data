The code snippet appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500
- `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6
- `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9
- `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`
- `li` is a list containing `n` elements where the `i-th` element is `a + k * c + d * i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`
- `k` is `k + 1`

After executing the line `li.append(a + k * c + d * h)`, the list `li` will now contain `n+1` elements. The new element added is `a + k * c + d * h`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first `n` elements are `a + k * c + d * i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the `(n+1)-th` element is `a + k * c + d * h`, `k` is `k + 1`.**
