To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for h in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `h`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `h` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500
- `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6
- `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9
- `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`
- `li` is a list containing one element `a + k * c + d * h`

At the end of the previous iteration, `h` would have taken some value from 0 to `n-1`. To proceed to the next iteration, `h` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's assume `h` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `h` should be `x + 1`.

Since none of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `li`) are part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element `a + k * c + d * h`, `h` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `h` at the end of the previous iteration**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `x`, we can generalize it to say `h` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

So, the final state can be written as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element `a + k * c + d * h`, `h` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For clarity, if we assume `h` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `h` will be `x + 1`. Since we don't have the exact value of `x`, we can simply state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element `a + k * c + d * h`, `h` is incremented by 1**. 

This means if `h` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the second iteration, and so on.

So, the most precise answer given the information is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element `a + k * c + d * h`, `h` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, if `h` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `h` will be 3. Therefore, a specific example state could be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element `a + k * c + d * h`, `h` is 3**.

But the general form is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element `a + k * c + d * h`, `h` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
