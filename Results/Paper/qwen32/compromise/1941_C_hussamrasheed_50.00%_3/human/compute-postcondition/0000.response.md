The value of `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n` and `s`) are not affected in this step. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
