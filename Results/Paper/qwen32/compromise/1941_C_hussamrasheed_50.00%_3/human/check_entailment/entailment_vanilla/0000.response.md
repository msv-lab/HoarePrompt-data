Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful.
- A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- We need to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful, which means we need to count the occurrences of "pie" and "map" and remove those substrings.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the string `n`.
   - It reads the string `s`.
   - It counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in `s` and stores it in `m`.
   - It removes all occurrences of "map" from `s` and stores the result in `s`.
   - It counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified `s` and stores it in `p`.
   - It prints the sum of `m` and `p`.

### Issues with the Provided Program:
1. **Counting and Removing Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of "map" and then removes them from the string `s`.
   - After removing "map", it counts the occurrences of "pie".
   - However, removing "map" might create new "pie" substrings that were not there initially. For example, if `s = "mapie"`, after removing "map", `s` becomes "ie", and no "pie" is counted, but the initial string was ugly due to "map".

2. **Non-Overlapping Substrings:**
   - The program does not account for overlapping substrings. For example, in the string "mapiepie", the program would count "map" once and "pie" once, but it should consider the possibility of overlapping substrings and find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all "pie" and "map" substrings.

3. **Minimum Deletions:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions to make the string beautiful. The provided program simply counts the number of "map" and "pie" substrings and sums them, which does not necessarily give the minimum deletions required.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It does not account for overlapping substrings and the possibility of creating new substrings after removing some.

Thus, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
