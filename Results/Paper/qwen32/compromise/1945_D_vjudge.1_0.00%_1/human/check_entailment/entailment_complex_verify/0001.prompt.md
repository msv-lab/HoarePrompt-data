You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in a line of `n` people. He can bribe people in front of him to swap positions, paying a certain number of coins for each swap. The goal is to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to achieve his goal.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input Reading**: Reads `n` (number of people in the queue), `k` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill), and two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
   - **Reversing Lists**: The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed.
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The code calculates a prefix sum of `lista_B` and uses it to determine the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions.
   - **Logic**:
     - The reversed lists are used to simplify the logic of moving Kirill from the end of the queue to the front.
     - The code iterates through the reversed lists and calculates the cost of moving Kirill to each position, keeping track of the minimum cost.
     - The final result is printed, which is the minimum number of coins required for Kirill to be in one of the first `m` positions.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Reading**: Reads the number of test cases.
   - **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

### Correctness
The provided solution seems to have a logical error in its approach. The reversal of the lists and the way the prefix sum is used may not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The problem involves moving Kirill to one of the first `m` positions, but the solution's logic does not correctly account for the cost of moving Kirill to each position while ensuring he ends up in one of the first `m` positions.

Let's consider the example provided:
- **Example Input**:
  ```
  4
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  6 2
  6 9 7 1 8 3
  5 8 8 1 4 1
  7 7
  7 2 9 2 6 5 9
  9 1 10 7 1 4 9
  2 1
  2 3
  1 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  14
  22
  9
  3
  ```

The solution provided does not correctly handle the problem's requirements, and the output does not match the expected results. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
