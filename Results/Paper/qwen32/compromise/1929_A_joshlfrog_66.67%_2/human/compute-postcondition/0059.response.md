Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces, `e` is `e + 1`. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0. `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. The current value of `nums[i]` is less than `y` before the update.**

In simple terms, the value of `y` has been updated to the current value of `nums[i]`. All other variables retain their previous states and conditions.
