Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than 5, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces, `e` is `e + 1`, `x` is `nums[5]` if `nums[5]` is greater than the original `x`; otherwise, `x` remains `nums[4]` if `nums[4]` was greater than the original `x`; otherwise, `x` remains 0, `y` is `nums[5]` if `nums[5]` is less than the original `y`; otherwise, `y` remains unchanged, `i` is 5.**
