The value of `x` is assigned the value of `nums[i]`. Given that `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces, and `i` is `i + 1`, `x` will now hold the value of the element at the index `i` in the list `nums`. The values of `t`, `l`, and `nums` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `nums[i]`**.
