Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is a new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in `nums`, `e` is `e + 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `x` will hold the maximum value from the list `nums`, and `y` will hold the minimum value from the list `nums`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop, and `e` is incremented by 1 as stated in the initial conditions.
