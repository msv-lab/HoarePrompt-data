Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500.
   - `l` is another input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers derived from a new input string split by spaces.
   - `x` is the maximum value in `nums`.
   - `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.
   - `e` is `e + 1` (Note: `e` is not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant for this task).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(x - y)`

From the initial state, we know that `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums` and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`. The print statement calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Since we don't have the specific values of `nums`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `x - y`. However, we know that `x - y` will be the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `nums`.

**Output:**
Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list `nums` and y is the minimum value in the list `nums`)**
