The code snippet `y = nums[i]` updates the value of `y` to the value of `nums[i]`. Given the initial state, `y` was initially set to 100000000, and now it is updated to the value of the `i`-th element in the `nums` list. The values of `t`, `l`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0. `y` is `nums[i]`.**
