The code snippet provided is `l = int(input())`, which means `l` is reassigned to the integer value of a new input. The other variables (`t`, `nums`, `x`, `y`, `e`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is a new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces; `x` is the maximum value in `nums`; `y` is the minimum value in `nums`; `e` is `e + 1`**.
