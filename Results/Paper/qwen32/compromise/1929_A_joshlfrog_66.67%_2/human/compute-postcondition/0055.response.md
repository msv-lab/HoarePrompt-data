Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, `e` is `e + 1`. The current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `x`.**
