The code snippet reassigns the list `nums` with new integer values from the input string split by spaces. This means the previous values of `nums`, `x` (the maximum value in `nums`), and `y` (the minimum value in `nums`) are updated. The variables `t`, `l`, and `e` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces; `x` is the maximum value in the new `nums`; `y` is the minimum value in the new `nums`; `e` is `e + 1`.**
