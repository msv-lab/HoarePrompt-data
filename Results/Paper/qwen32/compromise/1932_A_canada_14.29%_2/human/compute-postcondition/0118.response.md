The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `path` of length `n`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it satisfies the constraint 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, `n` is an integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 50, and `path` is a string consisting of the characters '.', '@', and '*', with the first character guaranteed to be '.'.

The function returns:
Case_1: For each test case, if the string `path` contains the character '*', the function returns "found";
Case_2: For each test case, if the string `path` does not contain the character '*', the function returns "not found".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `path` of length `n`. For each test case, it returns "found" if the character '*' is present in the string `path`, otherwise it returns "not found".**
