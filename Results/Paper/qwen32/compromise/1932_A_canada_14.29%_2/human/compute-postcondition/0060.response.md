The code snippet provided is `ret += 1`. This means the value of `ret` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`s`, `len`, `thorn`, `i`) are not affected by this code snippet. 

Given the initial state, `ret` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the current character `i` is '@'. After the increment, `ret` will be 1 or 2.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `len` is an input integer, `ret` is either 1 or 2, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**
