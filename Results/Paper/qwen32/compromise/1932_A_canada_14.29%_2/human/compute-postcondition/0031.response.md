The code snippet increments the value of `thorn` by 1. The values of `t`, `len`, `s`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, and `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the current `i`; `thorn` is increased by 1.**
