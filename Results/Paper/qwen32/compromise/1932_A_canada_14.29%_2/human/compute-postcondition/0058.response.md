The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` from the list `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. The other variables (`s`, `len`, `ret`, `thorn`) are not directly controlled by the loop head and should remain as they are for the purpose of this task.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current character from the list `s`. For the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the list `s`. 

Since `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, we can assume that there is at least one more character in `s` for the loop to execute again. 

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next character in the list `s`.

State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `len` is an input integer, `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. If the current character `i` is not '@' and `i` is equal to `*`, `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` was 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `*`, `thorn` remains 0. `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**
