The given code snippet `thorn == 0` is a comparison operation, not an assignment. It checks if the variable `thorn` is equal to 0 but does not change the value of `thorn` or any other variable. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `len` is an input integer, and the current character `i` is not equal to '@' and `i` is not equal to '*'**.
