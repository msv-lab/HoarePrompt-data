Postcondition: **`ret` is 0, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, and the current character `i` is not equal to '@'. If `i` is equal to '*', then `thorn` is 2 if the original `thorn` was 2, otherwise `thorn` remains 1. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.**
