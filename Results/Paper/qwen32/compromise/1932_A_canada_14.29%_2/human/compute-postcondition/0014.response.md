Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, and the current character `i` is equal to `'*'`. If `thorn` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 1.**
