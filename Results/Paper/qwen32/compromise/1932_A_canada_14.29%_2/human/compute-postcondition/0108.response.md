The code snippet `ret += 1` increments the value of `ret` by 1. Given the initial state, `ret` can have three possible values: 0, 1, or 2, depending on the value of the second character in the list `s`. 

- If the second character `i` is `'@'`, `ret` was initially 2, and after the increment, `ret` becomes 3.
- If the second character `i` is not `'@'`, `ret` was initially 0, and after the increment, `ret` becomes 1.

The values of `thorn`, `len`, and `s` remain unchanged. The second character `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ret` is 3 if the second character `i` is `'@'`, otherwise `ret` is 1; `thorn` is 0; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `i` is the second character in the list `s`.**
