The code snippet `ret += 1` increments the value of the variable `ret` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `i`, and `thorn`) remain unchanged. Since `ret` is incremented, its new value will be its previous value plus one. The initial state specifies that `thorn` is 0 and does not change. The values of `t`, `len`, `s`, and `i` are also not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, `ret` is incremented by 1, `thorn` is 0.**
