The code snippet assigns the value of `input()` converted to an integer to the variable `len`. Given that `input()` must return a string representation of `t`, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` will be assigned the value of `t`. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`**.
