The provided code snippet `thorn == 0` is a comparison operation that checks if the variable `thorn` is equal to 0. However, it does not assign a value to `thorn` or any other variable, so no changes are made to the state of the program. The comparison result is not stored or used anywhere in the snippet.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, and the current character `i` is not equal to '@' and `i` is not equal to '*'**
