The provided code snippet `thorn == 0` is a comparison and does not change the value of `thorn`. It merely checks if `thorn` is equal to 0, but since there is no assignment or operation that modifies `thorn`, its value remains unchanged.

Given the initial state, `thorn` could be either 0, 1, or 2 based on the conditions described. Since the comparison `thorn == 0` does not alter `thorn`, we do not change its possible values.

The other variables `s`, `len`, `ret`, and `i` are not affected by this comparison.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State with respect to the variables mentioned.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `len` is an input integer, `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. If the current character `i` is not '@' and `i` is equal to `*`, `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` was 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `*`, `thorn` remains 0. `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**
