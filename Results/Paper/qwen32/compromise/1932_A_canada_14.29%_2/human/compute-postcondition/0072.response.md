Postcondition: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `len` is an input integer, `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` reaches 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
