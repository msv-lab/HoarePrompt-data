The code snippet `thorn = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `thorn`. The other variables (`ret`, `len`, `s`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, and the current character `i` is '@'**.
