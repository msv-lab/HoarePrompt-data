The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `thorn` to 0. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `t`, `len`, `s`, and `ret`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial state with the addition of the `thorn` variable.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0.**
