Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is the new string input from the user, `b` is the new string input from the user, and `no_path` is `False` if `a[k]` is not equal to `'>'`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains `True`.**
