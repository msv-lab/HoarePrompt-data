Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to pair each '<' with a '>' such that each pair is either in the same string and non-overlapping, or one '<' is in the first string and the paired '>' is in the second string, and vice versa. It outputs "YES" if such a pairing is possible, otherwise it outputs "NO".**
