To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the specific variable `k` that is being printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is set to `0`.
3. `n` is an integer input greater than `2`.
4. `a` is a string input from the user.
5. `b` is a string input from the user with the second-to-last character being `'>'`.
6. `k` is the next value in the sequence defined by `range(1, n-1, 2)`.

### Key Variable: `k`
The variable `k` is defined by the sequence `range(1, n-1, 2)`. This sequence generates numbers starting from `1` up to (but not including) `n-1`, incrementing by `2` each time. The first value in this sequence is `1`.

### Determining the Value of `k`
- Since `k` is the next value in this sequence, and the sequence starts at `1`, the first value `k` will take is `1`.

### Output
Based on the initial state and the definition of `k`, the value that will be printed is the first value of the sequence `range(1, n-1, 2)`, which is `1`.

Output: **1**
