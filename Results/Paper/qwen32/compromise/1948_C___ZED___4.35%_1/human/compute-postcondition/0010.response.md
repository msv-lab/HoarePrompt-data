The code snippet provided only initializes a new variable `no_path` to `True`. None of the existing variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `no_path`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is a string input from the user, `b` is the next string input from the user, and the second-to-last character of `b` is `'>'`; `no_path` is `True`.**
