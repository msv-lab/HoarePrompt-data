Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `0`, `n` is an integer input greater than `2`, `a` is a string input from the user, `b` is a string input from the user with the second-to-last character being `'>'`, `k` is the next value in the sequence defined by `range(1, n-1, 2)`. If `a[k]` is not `'>'`, then `no_path` is `False`.**
