You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    4
    
    4
    
    >><<
    
    >>><
    
    2
    
    ><

    >>><
    
    >><<
    
    6
    
    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to pair each '<' with a '>' such that each pair is either in the same string and non-overlapping, or one '<' is in the first string and the paired '>' is in the second string, and vice versa. It outputs "YES" if such a pairing is possible, otherwise it outputs "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. Let's analyze the code and identify some issues:

1. **Initial Check for `b[-2] != '>'`:**
   - The code checks if the second last character in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not `>`. If it is not, the code immediately prints "NO". This is incorrect because the robot can still reach the target cell (2, n) even if `b[-2]` is not `>`, as long as there is a valid path that allows the robot to move to (2, n).

2. **Handling `n == 1`:**
   - The code checks if `n == 1` and prints "YES". This is incorrect because the problem states that `n` is even and at least 2, so `n` can never be 1.

3. **Checking for Valid Path:**
   - The code uses two loops to check if there are alternating `>` in the second row and `>` in the first row for odd indices. If either of these conditions is not met, it prints "NO". This logic is too simplistic and does not consider all possible valid paths the robot can take.
   - For example, consider the following test case:
     ```
     2
     4
     >>><
     >><<
     4
     >>><
     >><<
     ```
     The code will print "NO" for the first test case because it checks `b[-2]` and finds it to be `<`, but there is a valid path (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).
     The second test case is also incorrectly handled for the same reason.

4. **General Path Checking:**
   - The code does not implement a comprehensive path-checking mechanism that simulates the robot's movement according to the problem description. It needs to simulate the robot's movements step by step to determine if it can reach the target cell (2, n).

In summary, the code does not correctly handle all potential cases and fails to simulate the robot's movements accurately. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
