The only object in the loop head is the variable `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `ans`. If there are more elements in `ans` after the current `q`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` was the current element from the set `ans`, and `_` was incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be the next element in the set `ans`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`; `_` is incremented by 1; `q` is the next element in the set `ans` after the current one; `temp` is a set containing `(q - r) % n` and possibly `(q + r) % n` depending on the value of `c`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` also contains `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '1', `temp` remains an empty set.**
