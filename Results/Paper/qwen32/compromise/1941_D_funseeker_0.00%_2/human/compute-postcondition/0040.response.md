Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and, if `c` is '1' or '?', also contains the value `(q - r) % n`. `q` is the next element in the set `ans`.**
