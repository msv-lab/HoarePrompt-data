Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0. `ans` is a set containing at least two elements. `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` also contains the value `(q - r) % n`. `q` is the next element in the set `ans`.**

This postcondition captures the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering the conditions specified in the if part.
