To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `temp` set based on the values of `q`, `r`, `n`, and `c`.

### Loop Behavior Breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `ans` is a set of initial values.
   - `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer.
   - `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `temp` is initialized as an empty set.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `q` in `ans`, the loop checks the value of `c`.
   - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.

3. **Termination:**
   - The loop continues until all elements in `ans` have been processed.

### Final Output State:

- **`n`, `m`, `x`:** These values remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`:** This set remains unchanged as it is only used to iterate over its elements and not modified within the loop.
- **`r`:** This value remains unchanged as it is only used in calculations and not modified.
- **`c`:** This value remains unchanged as it is only used in conditional checks and not modified.
- **`_`:** This variable is incremented by 1 each time `func_1()` is called, but since we are only concerned with the loop's effect on `temp`, we do not need to consider its final value here.
- **`temp`:** This set will contain all the computed values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`, depending on the value of `c`.

### Determining the Final `temp`:

- If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` will contain `(q + r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` will contain `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`.
- If `c` is '?', `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`.

### Conclusion:

The final `temp` set will contain all the calculated values based on the conditions specified by `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing all the initial values; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`; `_` is incremented by 1; `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` if `c` is '?', only `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', and only `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1'.**

In simpler terms, the final `temp` set will have all the computed values based on the conditions of `c` for each element in `ans`. The other variables remain the same as they were initially.
