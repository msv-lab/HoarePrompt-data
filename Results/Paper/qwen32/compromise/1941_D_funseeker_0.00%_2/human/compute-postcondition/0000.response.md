The code snippet `n, m, x = func_3()` indicates that the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are being reassigned to the values returned by the function `func_3()`. Therefore, the new values of `n`, `m`, and `x` will be whatever `func_3()` returns.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.**
