Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing all the values `(q + r) % n` and, if `c` is '1' or '?', also contains the value `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`; `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`.**

In simple terms, the variable `ans` is now updated to be the set `temp`, which contains all the values `(q + r) % n` and, if `c` is '1' or '?', also contains the value `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
