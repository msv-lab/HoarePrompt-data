The provided code snippet initializes a new set named `temp`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, or `c`. The precondition that `m` is one less than its previous value, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` remains valid. The only change is the introduction of a new set `temp`.

Output State: **`n`, `m` is one less than the previous value, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.**
