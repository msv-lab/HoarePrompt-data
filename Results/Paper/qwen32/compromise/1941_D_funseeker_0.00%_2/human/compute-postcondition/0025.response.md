The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`. Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop's continuation, we only need to consider `m` for determining whether the loop can execute again. The loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` should be decremented by 1, so it remains greater than 0.

State: **`n`, `m` is one less than the previous value, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`**.
