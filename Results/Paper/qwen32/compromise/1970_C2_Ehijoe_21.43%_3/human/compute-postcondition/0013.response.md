Postcondition: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers from 1 to n representing nodes, and values are lists containing the neighboring nodes connected by edges; `start` is the integer read from the input; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `t` is the second integer read from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that have exactly one neighbor (leaf nodes); `moves` is the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`, and all elements in `moves` are even numbers**
