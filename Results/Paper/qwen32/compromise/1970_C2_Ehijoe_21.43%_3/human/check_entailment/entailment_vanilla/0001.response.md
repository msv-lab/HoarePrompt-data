To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Tree Structure**: The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone on the tree.
   - They can only move the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
3. **Objective**: Determine who wins the game given the starting node of the stone, assuming both players play optimally.
4. **Winning Condition**:
   - If the number of moves (total distance from the starting node to all leaves) includes any odd number, Ron wins.
   - If all moves are even, Hermione wins.

### Program Analysis
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - The tree is represented using an adjacency list (`nodes`).
2. **Leaf Nodes**:
   - The program identifies leaf nodes (nodes with only one connection).
3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` recursively calculates the distance from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
   - It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore the tree.
4. **Winning Decision**:
   - The program checks if any of the distances to the leaves are odd.
   - If an odd distance is found, it concludes that Ron wins.
   - Otherwise, it concludes that Hermione wins.

### Correctness Verification
- **Graph Construction**: The adjacency list is correctly constructed based on the input edges.
- **DFS Implementation**: The recursive function `func_1` correctly computes the distances to all leaves from the starting node.
- **Winning Condition**: The logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the distances is correct.

### Example Verification
For the provided example:
```
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
1
```
- The tree structure is:
  ```
  1 - 2
  |
  3 - 4
  |
  5
  ```
- Starting at node `1`, the distances to the leaves are `[1, 2, 2]` (to nodes `2`, `4`, `5` respectively).
- Since there is an odd distance (`1`), Ron wins.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided rules and example. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

Correctness: **True**
