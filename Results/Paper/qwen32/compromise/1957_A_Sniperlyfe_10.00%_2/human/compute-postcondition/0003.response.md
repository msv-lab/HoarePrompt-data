Output State: **The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 4.**

This means that for each unique integer in the list `arr` (excluding the first element `t`), the program calculates how many sets of 4 can be formed from the occurrences of that integer and sums these values across all unique integers.
