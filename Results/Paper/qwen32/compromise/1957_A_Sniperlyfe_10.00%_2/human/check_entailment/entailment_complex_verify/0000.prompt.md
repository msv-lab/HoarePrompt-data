You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the stick lengths; `freq` is a dictionary with keys as the integers from `arr` and values as the counts of how many times each integer appears in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 4.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers where the first element represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent element describes stick lengths for those test cases. It returns the total count of how many sets of four sticks can be formed from all the stick lengths provided across all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement to form regular polygons with the given sticks. The function `func_1` only considers forming squares (polygons with 4 sides) by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4. However, the problem statement allows for regular polygons with any number of sides (triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.).

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Expected Output:**
```
1
```
**Explanation of Expected Output:**
We can form a regular pentagon with 5 sticks of length 1.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
0
```
**Explanation of Actual Output:**
The function `func_1` divides the frequency of each stick length by 4, which results in 0 for 5 sticks of length 1, since 5 // 4 = 1 but the function does not account for forming a pentagon.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it only considers forming squares and does not account for other regular polygons.
