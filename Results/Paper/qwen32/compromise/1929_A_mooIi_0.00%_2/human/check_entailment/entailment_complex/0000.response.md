Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n, after potentially rearranging the elements of the array to maximize this sum. The beauty of the array is maximized when the array is sorted in ascending order because this arrangement maximizes the positive differences and minimizes the negative ones.

However, the given program sorts the array and prints it, but it does not calculate or print the beauty of the array. It simply outputs the sorted array as a space-separated string, which is not the expected output.

The correct program should sort the array, compute the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, and then print this beauty for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
