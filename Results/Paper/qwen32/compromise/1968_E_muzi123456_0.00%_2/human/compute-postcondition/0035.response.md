The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n + 1):`, the loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. The variable `n` is the upper limit (inclusive) for `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been some value, and `n` would have been the user-provided value with the constraint 2 <= n <= 10^3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain the same.

Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `k + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given that we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` (where `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration).

Since `n` is provided by the user and does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

State: **`n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

However, to provide a more concrete example, let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 4.

State: **`n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 4**

But since we don't know the exact value of `i`, the most accurate state representation would be:

State: **`n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
