The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This means that the variable `n` will be assigned the value of an integer input provided by the user. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.

The impact of the code snippet is that `n` will be updated to the value provided by the user input, which is an integer. The value of `t` and the constraints on `n` for the test cases remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, and `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3.**
