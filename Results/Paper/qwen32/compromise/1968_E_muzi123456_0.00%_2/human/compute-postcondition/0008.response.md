The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print('1', end=' ')`. This statement will print the string `'1'` to the console, followed by a space, without adding a newline at the end.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the print statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` function is called with the string `'1'` as its argument.
2. The `end` parameter of the `print` function is set to a space `' '`, which means that after printing the string `'1'`, a space will be printed instead of the default newline character.
3. No other variables or objects are referenced in the print statement, so their values do not influence the output.

Thus, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **1 ** (where the output is the number 1 followed by a space)
