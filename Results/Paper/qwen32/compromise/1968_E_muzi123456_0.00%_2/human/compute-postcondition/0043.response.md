Output State: **t is 0, and for each of the initial t test cases, the numbers from 1 to n have been printed in the format '1 i' for each i from 1 to n, followed by a space.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the numbers from 1 to `n` will have been printed in the format '1 i' for each `i` from 1 to `n`, and each test case's output will be followed by a space.
