The code snippet `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` was already an integer value provided by the user input, where `2 <= n <= 10^3`. However, the execution of this code will reassign `n` to the new integer input provided by the user. The other variables `t` and `i` are not affected by this assignment.

Since `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is `n + 1`, these conditions and values remain unchanged by the new assignment to `n`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `n + 1`.**
