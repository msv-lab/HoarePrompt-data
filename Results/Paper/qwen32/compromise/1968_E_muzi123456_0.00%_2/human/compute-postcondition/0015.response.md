The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` is not zero. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be a non-zero value.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49
- `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3
- `i` is n + 1

The only variable that affects the loop condition is `t`. Since `t` must be non-zero for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is n + 1**
