The provided Python code snippet is:

```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

This statement will print the string `'1'` followed by a space, without adding a newline after the space. The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function specifies that the string should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

The initial state mentions that `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. However, these variables (`n` and `i`) are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this particular `print` statement.

Given the information, the output will be:

Output: **1 ** (where the output is the number 1 followed by a space)
