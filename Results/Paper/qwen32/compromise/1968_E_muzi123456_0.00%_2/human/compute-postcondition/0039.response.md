The provided Python code snippet is:

```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

Let's analyze the code based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State Details**:
   - `n` is an integer provided by user input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `print` function is called with two arguments:
     - The first argument is the string `'1'`.
     - The second argument is `end=' '`, which specifies that after printing `'1'`, a space (`' '`) should be used instead of the default newline character (`'\n'`).

3. **Output Determination**:
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'1'` followed by a space.
   - The values of `n` and `i` do not influence this specific `print` statement because they are not used within it.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **1 ** (where the output includes the number 1 followed by a space)
