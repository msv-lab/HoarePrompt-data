Reasoning:
The given program is supposed to output `n` points on an `n x n` grid for each test case, such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these points is maximized.

The provided program, however, does not achieve this goal. Here's what the program does:

1. It reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. Then, for each `i` from 1 to `n`, it prints the point `(1, i)`.

This means that the program always outputs points that lie on the first row of the grid. As a result, the only possible Manhattan distances between any pair of these points are of the form `|1-1| + |i-j| = |i-j|`, where `i` and `j` range from 1 to `n`. This limits the possible distinct Manhattan distances to the values `0, 1, 2, ..., n-1`, which is far from maximizing the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

To maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances, the points should be strategically placed across the grid to cover a wider range of distances.

For example, for `n=3`, the provided program would output:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
This results in the set of Manhattan distances `{0, 1, 2}`.

However, the optimal solution for `n=3` would be something like:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
This results in the set of Manhattan distances `{0, 1, 2, 3}`, which is larger.

Thus, the given program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
