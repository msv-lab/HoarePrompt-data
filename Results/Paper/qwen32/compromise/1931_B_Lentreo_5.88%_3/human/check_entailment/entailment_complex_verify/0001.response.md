### Reasoning:

The provided program is indeed incorrect based on the problem description and the annotations. Let's break down the issues and the correct approach:

#### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Cumulative Difference Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `curr` as the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`, where `last` is the last element of `nums`. This does not correctly reflect the balance needed to equalize the water levels.
   - The program does not consider the cumulative difference needed to balance the water levels progressively from the start to the end of the list.

2. **Flawed Logic**:
   - The logic of the program is not aligned with the requirement to ensure that the cumulative water amount up to each container (after adjusting for the average) is balanced out.
   - The program fails to check if the water can be distributed evenly by progressively pouring water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed ones.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate the Target Water Level**:
   - The target water level for each container is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers, which is guaranteed to be an integer due to the problem constraints.

2. **Iterate and Check Cumulative Difference**:
   - Iterate through the list of water amounts and maintain a running total of the cumulative water amount and the expected cumulative water amount (target water level times the number of containers seen so far).
   - Ensure that the running total of the difference between the actual cumulative water amount and the expected cumulative water amount is zero at the end of the iteration.

#### Correct Implementation:
Here is a correct implementation based on the above logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        target = sum(nums) // n
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            curr += i - target
            if curr < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            if curr == 0:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

# This implementation correctly checks if the water can be evenly distributed.
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program is incorrect. The program does not correctly simulate the process of pouring water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed ones and does not maintain the necessary cumulative balance.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
