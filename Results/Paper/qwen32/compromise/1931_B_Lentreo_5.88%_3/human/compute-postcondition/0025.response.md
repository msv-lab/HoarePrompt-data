The code snippet `last = nums[-1]` updates the value of `last` to be the last element of the list `nums`. The other variables (`nums`, `curr`, `t`, `n`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input; `curr` is the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in the previous `nums`; `last` is the last element of the current `nums`; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer.**
