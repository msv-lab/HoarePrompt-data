To determine the necessary adjustments for the given program state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `nums`, so we need to ensure that `nums` is in a state that allows the loop to execute.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in nums:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `nums`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums` is a list with at least one element for the loop to execute.

Here are the states provided:
- `nums` is a list of integers from the input.
- `curr` is 0.
- `last` is the last element of the current `nums`.
- `t` is decremented by 1.
- `n` is an input integer.

Since `curr`, `last`, `t`, and `n` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, `nums` must have at least one element for the loop to start.

So, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `curr` is 0, `last` is the last element of the current `nums`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer**.

However, for the loop to execute, the specific values of `curr`, `last`, `t`, and `n` are not relevant. Therefore, the minimal necessary adjustment is to ensure `nums` has at least one element.

Final State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element**.
