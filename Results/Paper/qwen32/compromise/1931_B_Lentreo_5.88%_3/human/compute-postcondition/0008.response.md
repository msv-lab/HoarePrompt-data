The code snippet `curr += i - last` modifies the value of `curr` by adding the result of `i - last` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `i` remain unchanged. Since `curr` was initially 0, it will now hold the value `i - last`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `last` is the last element of `nums`; `curr` is `i - last`; `i` is not 0**.
