The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it iterates over the elements of the list `nums`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `nums` must have at least one element. The variables `t`, `n`, `last`, and `curr` are not directly involved in the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `last` is the last element of `nums`; `curr` is 0**
