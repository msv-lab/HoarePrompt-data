The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`nums`, `curr`, `last`, `t`, `n`) and a condition involving the sum of differences between indices `i` and `last` for non-zero elements in `nums`. However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on these variables or the condition provided.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not reference any of the variables or the condition, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
