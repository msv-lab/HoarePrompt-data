To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `curr` and `last` based on the input list `nums`.

The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `nums`. For each iteration:
- If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to it.
- `last` is updated to the current element `i` after each iteration.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `curr` starts at 0.
   - `last` is initially set to the last element of `nums`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each element `i` in `nums` from the first to the last:
     - If `i` is not 0, `curr` is incremented by `i - last`.
     - `last` is updated to `i`.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop completes, `curr` will contain the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`, where `last` is the value of the previous element in the iteration.
   - `last` will be the last element of `nums` after the loop finishes.

Let's denote the final value of `curr` after all iterations as `final_curr`.

**Output State: **final_curr is the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`, and `last` is the last element of `nums`.**

In simpler terms, the final value of `curr` is the accumulated difference between each non-zero element and the previous element in the list, and `last` is simply the last element of the list `nums`.

To summarize:

Output State: **`curr` is the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`, and `last` is the last element of `nums`.**
