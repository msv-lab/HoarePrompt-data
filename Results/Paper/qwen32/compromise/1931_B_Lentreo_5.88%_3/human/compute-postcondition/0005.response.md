The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `curr`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `last` is the last element of `nums`; `curr` is 0.**
