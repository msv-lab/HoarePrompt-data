Reasoning: 

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Construction of `b`:** The program constructs the list `b` by appending elements from the original array `a` based on the commands in `s`. However, it does not compute the product of all elements in the current state of `a` before removing an element. Instead, it simply appends the selected element to `b`. This results in `b` containing only the elements that were removed from `a`, not the products of the array states.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Product Modulo `m`:** The program calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, but it does not take the modulo `m` at each step. The problem requires that the remainder of the product of all elements of the current state of the array `a` be output before removing an element, and this remainder should be computed modulo `m`.

3. **Incorrect Output Order:** The program reverses the list `ans` before returning it, which is unnecessary and incorrect based on the problem's requirements. The output should be in the order the commands are processed, not in reverse.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
