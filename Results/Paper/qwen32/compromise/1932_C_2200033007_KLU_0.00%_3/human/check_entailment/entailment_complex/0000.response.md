### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Construction of `b`:**
   - The function `func_1` constructs the list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`. However, it does not compute the product of all elements of the array `a` at each step as required. Instead, it simply collects elements in `b` according to the commands.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Product:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list. However, it does not take the remainder of the product of all elements of the current array `a` modulo `m` at each step before removing an element. It only calculates the product of the collected elements in `b`.

3. **Incorrect Output:**
   - The program's output is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, not the remainders of the product of all elements of the current array `a` modulo `m` at each step.

### Correct Approach:
- For each command, compute the product of all elements of the current array `a` modulo `m`.
- Output this remainder.
- Remove the leftmost or rightmost element based on the command.
- Repeat until all elements are removed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness: **False**
