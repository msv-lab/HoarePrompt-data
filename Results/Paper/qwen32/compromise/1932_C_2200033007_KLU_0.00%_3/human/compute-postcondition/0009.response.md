Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` in reversed order, where `ans` contains the cumulative product of elements of `b` in reverse order.**

Explanation: Given that `ans` already holds the cumulative product of elements of `b` in reverse order, the `reversed(ans)` operation will simply return `ans` as is, because reversing a list that is already in reverse order results in the original order of the cumulative products.
