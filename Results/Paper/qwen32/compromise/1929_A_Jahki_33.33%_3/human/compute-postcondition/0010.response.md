Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, such that `num2` > 1; `i` is `num2 - 1`. If `a[i - 1] >= a[i]`, `order` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `order` remains unchanged.**
