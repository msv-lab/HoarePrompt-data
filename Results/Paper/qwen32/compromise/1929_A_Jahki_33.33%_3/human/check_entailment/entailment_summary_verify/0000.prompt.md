You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` checks if a list of integers `a` is strictly increasing. It returns `True` if every element in the list is less than the next element, and `False` otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function and the overall logic for calculating the maximum beauty of the array is incorrect.

The `func_1` function is intended to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, it incorrectly returns `True` if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, which means the program will output `0` for already sorted arrays. This contradicts the problem description, which requires the program to calculate the maximum beauty regardless of the initial order of the array.

Additionally, the program sorts the array in non-decreasing order and calculates the beauty based on this sorted array. However, the maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array in non-increasing order instead, as this will maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```
This is because the maximum beauty is achieved with the array sorted in non-increasing order: `[3, 2, 1]`, resulting in a beauty of `(3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 4`.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
2
```
The program sorts the array in non-decreasing order: `[1, 2, 3]`, resulting in a beauty of `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`.

To fix the program, the array should be sorted in non-increasing order, and the beauty should be calculated based on this sorted array.
