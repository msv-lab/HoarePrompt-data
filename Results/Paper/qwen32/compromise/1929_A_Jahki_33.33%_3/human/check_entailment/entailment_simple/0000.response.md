### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and see if it correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement.

#### Program Logic Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the array length `n` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Sorting for Maximum Beauty:**
   - The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order to maximize the beauty. This is because the beauty is the sum of differences `a_i - a_{i-1}` for `i` from `2` to `n`. Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

3. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - After sorting, the program calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program includes a special case check using the function `func_1`. This function checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `True`, and the program prints `0` as the beauty. However, this special case is unnecessary because the beauty calculation will correctly compute the beauty as `0` for an already sorted array.

#### Issues in the Program:

- The function `func_1` is unnecessary and does not add value to the program. The beauty calculation will correctly handle arrays that are already sorted.
- The function `func_1` returns `True` if the array is in non-decreasing order, but the program prints `0` only when `func_1` returns `True`. This is correct but redundant.

#### Correctness:

Despite the unnecessary function `func_1`, the program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and summing the differences between consecutive elements. The logic for calculating the beauty is correct.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array, and the logic is sound, even though it includes a redundant function `func_1`.
