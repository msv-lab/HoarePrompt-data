Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller one as the area of the square. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the points being compared are opposite corners of the square. The program does not correctly identify the correct pairs of points to calculate the side length of the square.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
0 0
1 0
0 1
1 1
```
The correct area of the square is 1 (since the side length is 1). However, the program might calculate the distance between (0,0) and (1,0) which is 1, and also between (0,1) and (1,1) which is 1, and print 1, which is correct in this case. But let's consider another case:

```
1
0 0
2 0
0 2
2 2
```
The correct area of the square is 4 (since the side length is 2). However, the program might calculate the distance between (0,0) and (2,0) which is 4, and also between (0,2) and (2,2) which is 4, and print 4, which is correct in this case. But let's consider a case where the program might fail:

```
1
0 0
1 0
0 1
2 1
```
In this case, the correct area of the square is 1 (since the side length is 1). However, the program might calculate the distance between (0,0) and (1,0) which is 1, but also between (0,1) and (2,1) which is 2, and print 1, which is incorrect because the points (0,1) and (2,1) are not opposite corners of the square.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
