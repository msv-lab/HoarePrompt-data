Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `r` is the first element of `a`; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; and either `i + 1` is out of bounds for `a` or `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`**
