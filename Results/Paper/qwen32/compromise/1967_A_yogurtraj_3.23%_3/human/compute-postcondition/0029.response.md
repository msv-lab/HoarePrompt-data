To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet:

```python
r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `i` is `i + 1`

The new value of `i` is `i + 1`, so `i` has been incremented by 1.

The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Here, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`, and `k // (i + 1)` is the integer division of `k` by `i + 1`.

Since the exact values of `k` and the elements of `a` are not specified, we can only express `r` in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is `i + 1`; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`**.
