The given code snippet modifies the value of `k`. Specifically, it subtracts `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from `k`.

Given the initial state, the value of `k` is either `0` or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. After executing the line `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, the new value of `k` will be `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.

Since the other variables (`a`, `n`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, `ii`, and `i`) are not modified by this line of code, their values remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `a[i + 1]`; `rem` is `0` if the if part was executed, otherwise it remains `0`; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration; `i` is `i + 1`**.
