The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, and `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this line of code was executed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is `i + 1`; `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**
