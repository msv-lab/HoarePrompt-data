The only variable in the loop head is `ii`. Therefore, we need to adjust only `ii` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, and `k`, `rem`, `y`, and `ii` remain unchanged.
- Otherwise, if the loop breaks during iteration `i`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is `0`, and `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- If the loop completes all iterations, `r` is `a[n - 1]`, `rem` is `0`, `y` is `0`, `k` is updated as `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for each iteration, and `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `ii`, we increment `ii` by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.

State: **If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, and `k`, `rem`, `y`, and `ii` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if the loop breaks during iteration `i`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is `0`, and `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If the loop completes all iterations, `r` is `a[n - 1]`, `rem` is `0`, `y` is `0`, `k` is updated as `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for each iteration, and `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.** 

To simplify the final state representation:
State: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
