Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `r` is the first element of `a`; `rem` is `0`; `y` is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `k` is either 0 (if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` was greater than `k` and we broke out of the loop) or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` (if the else part was executed); `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `a[i + 1]`; `rem` is `0` if the if part was executed, otherwise it remains `0`; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `k` is either 0 (if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` was greater than `k` and we broke out of the loop) or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` (if the else part was executed); `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `a[i + 1]`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the if part was executed, otherwise it remains `0`; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `k` is either 0 (if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` was greater than the original `k` and we broke out of the loop) or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` (if the else part was executed); `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `a[i + 1]`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the if part was executed, otherwise it remains `0`; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration; `i` is `i + 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
