Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is set to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is set to `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is set to 0. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.**
