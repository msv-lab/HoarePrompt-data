The code assigns the first element of the sorted list `a` to the variable `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `r` is the first element of `a`.**
