Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`
- `rem` is either `k % (i + 1)` or `0`
- `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or `0`
- `k` is either `0` or reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-2`
- `k` is not equal to `0`

### Print Statement:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `r`**: 
   - `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`. This means `r` is the last element of the list `a` plus the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Expression to be printed**:
   - The expression to be printed is `(r - 1) * n + 1`.
   - Substituting the value of `r`, we get `((a[n - 1] + k // n) - 1) * n + 1`.
   - Simplifying this, we get `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1`.

### Final Expression:
- The final expression to be printed is `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1`.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1**
