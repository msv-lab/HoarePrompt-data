### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program to ensure it correctly determines whether the digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Logic to Determine Output:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "STAIR".
   - If the digits do not form a "STAIR", it then checks if `a == b == c`. If true, it outputs "NONE".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it then checks if `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, and `c` using `max(a, b, c) == b`. If true, it outputs "PEAK".
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it outputs "NONE".

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where all three digits are the same (`a == b == c`) by outputting "NONE".
   - It correctly identifies a "STAIR" when `a < b < c`.
   - It correctly identifies a "PEAK" when `a < b` and `b > c`.

4. **Correctness:**
   - The logic in the program correctly implements the problem's requirements.
   - The conditions are checked in a mutually exclusive manner, ensuring that only one output is printed per test case.
   - The program correctly handles all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
