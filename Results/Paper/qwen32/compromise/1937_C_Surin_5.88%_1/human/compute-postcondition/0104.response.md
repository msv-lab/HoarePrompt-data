The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, `n` was already defined as being greater than 1. After executing this line, the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the input.

Since the input operation changes the value of `n`, we need to reflect this in the output state. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the input integer, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `<` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `>` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is `n-1`, `kp` is 2**
