The code snippet `r = input('')` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `r` now holds the value of the input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., new `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is the new input integer, `kp` is 1, `v2` is the new input integer `i`, `r` is the input string.**
