The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which `r` == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `r` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` is incremented at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be the value of `i + 1` from the previous iteration. Therefore, we just need to ensure that `i` is still less than `n`.

To simplify, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` from the previous iteration, ensuring `i + 1` is less than `n`.
