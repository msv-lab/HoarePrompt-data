To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable does not directly affect the print statement.
2. **n**: An integer greater than 1.
3. **p**: A permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\).
4. **I**: A lambda function (not explicitly used in the print statement).
5. **R**: A lambda function (not explicitly used in the print statement).
6. **g**: Set to 0 (not used in the print statement).
7. **prev**: The highest index \(i\) for which the response \(r\) was '>'. If no such index exists, it is not specified but logically it could be set to a default value like -1 or 0. Since it's not specified, we'll assume it holds a valid index or 0 if no '>' response was received.
8. **i**: Set to \(n-1\), which is the last index of the permutation list \(p\).
9. **kp**: Set to 2 (not used in the print statement).
10. **v2**: Set to \(n-1\), which is the last index of the permutation list \(p\).
11. **v1**: The highest index \(i\) for which the response \(r\) was '<' or 0 if no such \(i\) was found. If no such index exists, it is set to 0.

Given these details, the print statement is:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `prev` is the highest index where the response was '>'.
- `v1` is the highest index where the response was '<', or 0 if no such index exists.

Since the exact values of `prev` and `v1` are not explicitly provided, we can only describe them based on the conditions given. Therefore, the output will be in terms of these descriptions.

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where prev is the highest index i for which the response r was '>', and v1 is the highest index i for which the response r was '<' or 0 if no such i was found)**
