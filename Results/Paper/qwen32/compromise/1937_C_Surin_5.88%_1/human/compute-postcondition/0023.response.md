Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is 5.
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list.
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer.
- `g` is 0.
- `v2` is 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `r` is the input string. If `r` equals `<`, then `v1` is set to 4.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the initial state, we know that `v2` is explicitly set to 3. However, the value of `v1` depends on the input string `r`. Specifically, if `r` equals `<`, then `v1` is set to 4. Since the value of `r` is not explicitly stated in the initial state, we need to consider both possibilities.

#### Case 1: `r` does not equal `<`
In this case, `v1` is not explicitly set to 4, so its value is unknown from the given information. However, since no other value is assigned to `v1` in the initial state, we can assume that `v1` remains undefined or retains its default value if it was initialized elsewhere (which is not mentioned here). For the sake of providing a precise answer based on the given information, we'll assume `v1` is not set to any specific value unless `r` equals `<`.

#### Case 2: `r` equals `<`
In this case, `v1` is explicitly set to 4.

Given the ambiguity about the value of `r`, we need to provide a precise description of the output based on the conditions provided.

### Final Output:
Since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we need to consider both scenarios. However, the problem asks for the most precise description possible based on the precondition. Given that `r` could be `<` or any other value, we should account for both possibilities.

If `r` equals `<`, `v1` is 4. Otherwise, `v1` remains undefined based on the given information. To provide a precise answer, we'll consider the scenario where `r` equals `<` as it is explicitly mentioned in the precondition.

Output: **? 4 4 3 3 (assuming r equals '<')**
