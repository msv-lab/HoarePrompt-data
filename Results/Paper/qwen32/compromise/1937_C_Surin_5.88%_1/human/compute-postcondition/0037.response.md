The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the largest index i for which `r` == '<' was observed during the loop iterations
- `prev` is `i` if `r` equals '>', otherwise `prev` remains unchanged
- `r` is the input string. If `r` equals '>', `prev` is set to the current index `i`

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, say `k`, where `1 ≤ k < n`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which `r` == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `prev` is `i` if `r` equals '>', otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, and `r` is the input string, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` from the given information, we express the next state in terms of `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which `r` == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `prev` is `i` if `r` equals '>', otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, and `r` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**.
