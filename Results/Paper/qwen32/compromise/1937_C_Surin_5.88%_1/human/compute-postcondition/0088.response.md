The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `<` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `prev` is 1 if `r` is `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0, `i` is 2, `kp` is 1, and `r` is the user input.**
