The code snippet `v2 = i` updates the value of `v2` to the current value of `i`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is greater than 1
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the new input integer `i` if `r` equals '<', otherwise `v1` remains 0
- `prev` is the last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found
- `i` is the new input integer + 1
- `kp` is 1
- `v2` is the new input integer `i`
- `r` is the input string. Specifically, if `r` equals '<', `v1` is set to the new input integer `i`; otherwise, `v1` remains unchanged.

After executing `v2 = i`, the value of `v2` changes to the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the new input integer `i` if `r` equals '<', otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is the new input integer + 1, `kp` is 1, `v2` is the new input integer `i`, `r` is the input string.**
