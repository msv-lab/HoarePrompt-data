The code snippet provided only updates the value of `v2`. According to the initial state, `v2` is initially set to the new input integer `i`. After executing the line `v2 = i`, the value of `v2` remains the same as the new input integer `i`, which is `i`.

All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the new input integer `i` if `r` equals '<', otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is the new input integer + 1, `kp` is 1, `v2` is the new input integer `i`, `r` is the input string**
