The given code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not alter any variables or change the state of the program in terms of variable values. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `i`) are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which r == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `prev` is the last index i for which r == '>' was observed, or 0 if no such i was found, and `i` is n.**
