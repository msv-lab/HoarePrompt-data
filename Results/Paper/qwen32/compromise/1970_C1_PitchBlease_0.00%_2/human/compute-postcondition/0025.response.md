The only object in the loop head is the variable `neighbor`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tree[current]`. If `tree[current]` contains at least one neighbor, the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `tree[current]` has at least one neighbor.

State: **`queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, `visited` contains all visited nodes, `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor, `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged**
