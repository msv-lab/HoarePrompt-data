The code snippet adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. Therefore, the `visited` set now contains the `start` node and the `neighbor` node. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes with `start` having at least one neighbor, `queue` is a deque that is now empty, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start` and `neighbor`, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `current` is not equal to `target`, and `neighbor` is not in `visited`.** 

In simpler terms, the neighbor node has been added to the set of visited nodes. All other variables retain their initial values.
