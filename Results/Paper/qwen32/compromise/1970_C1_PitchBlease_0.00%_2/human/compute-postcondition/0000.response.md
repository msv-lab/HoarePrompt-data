The code snippet initializes a queue with a tuple containing the starting node and an initial distance of 0. This means the queue now holds the starting node along with the information that it is 0 steps away from itself.

Output State: **start is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, target is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree. The tree is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes. The queue is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`.**
