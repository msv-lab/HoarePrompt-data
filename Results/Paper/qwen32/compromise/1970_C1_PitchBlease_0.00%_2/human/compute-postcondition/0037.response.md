Postcondition: **`queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, including `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, it is now added to `visited`, and the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`. `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least one more neighbor. `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`. `start` and `target` remain unchanged. `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`.**
