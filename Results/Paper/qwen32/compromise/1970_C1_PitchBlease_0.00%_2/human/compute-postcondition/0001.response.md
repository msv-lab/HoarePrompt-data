Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree. The tree is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes. The queue is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`.**

In this output state, the `visited` set now contains the starting node, indicating that this node has been visited in the BFS algorithm. All other variables remain unchanged.
