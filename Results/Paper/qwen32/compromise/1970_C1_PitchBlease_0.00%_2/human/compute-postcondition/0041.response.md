Output State: **The program returns the distance from `start` to `current`.**

In this context, `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, which has just been removed from the `queue`. The `visited` set contains all the nodes that have been reached, and the `queue` has one less element compared to its previous state. The `start` and `target` nodes remain unchanged. Therefore, the program returns the value of `dist`, which represents the distance from `start` to `current`.
