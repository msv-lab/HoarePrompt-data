The code snippet `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the set `visited`. This means that `neighbor` is now considered visited. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, `visited` contains all visited nodes including `neighbor`, `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least two neighbors, `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `visited` includes `neighbor` and `queue` has an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`**.
