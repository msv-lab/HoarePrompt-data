Output State: **`queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, including `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. `visited` contains all visited nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least one more neighbor. `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`. `start` and `target` remain unchanged. `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`.**

Natural language: The `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` node. All other variables remain unchanged, and the `queue` still contains tuples of unvisited neighbors along with their respective distances.
