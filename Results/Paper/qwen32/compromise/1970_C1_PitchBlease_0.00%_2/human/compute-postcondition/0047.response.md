Postcondition: **`queue` has the same number of elements as initially, with an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; `visited` contains all reachable nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor; `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`; `start` and `target` remain unchanged; `tree[current]` is a list with at least one element.**
