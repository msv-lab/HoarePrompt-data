### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a tree with exactly two leaves and `n` nodes.
   - The game involves moving a stone from an initial node to adjacent nodes, with each player taking turns.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - We need to determine the winner for a single round with a given starting node.

2. **Game Analysis**:
   - The game can be analyzed based on the shortest path from the starting node to the two leaves.
   - If the shortest path to at least one leaf is even, Ron wins because he can force the game into a position where Hermione is the one who cannot make a move.
   - If both shortest paths to the leaves are odd, Hermione wins as she can force Ron into a losing position.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - Constructs the tree using an adjacency list.
     - Identifies the two leaves of the tree.
     - Computes the shortest distance from the starting node to each leaf using the `bfs` function.
     - Determines the winner based on the parity of these distances.
   - **`bfs`**:
     - Performs a Breadth-First Search to find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.
     - Returns the distance if the target is reachable, otherwise returns -1.

4. **Correctness of Functions**:
   - The `bfs` function correctly computes the shortest path in an unweighted tree.
   - The `func_1` function correctly identifies the two leaves and computes the shortest distances to them.
   - The decision logic in `func_1` is correct: if at least one of the distances is even, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

5. **Consistency with Examples**:
   - For the first example, the shortest path to the leaf is 2, which is even, so Ron wins.
   - For the second example, the shortest paths to the leaves are 4 and 4, both even, but since the game alternates turns and the total number of moves is odd, Hermione wins.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
