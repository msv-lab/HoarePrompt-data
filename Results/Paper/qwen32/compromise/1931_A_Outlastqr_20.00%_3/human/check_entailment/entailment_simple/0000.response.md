Reasoning:
The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded into a given sum `n`. The program uses the following logic for different ranges of `n`:

1. If `n > 52`, it constructs the word by placing the letter corresponding to `n - 53` as the first letter and appending `'zz'` to it. This is because the maximum sum of two `'z'` letters (26 + 26) is 52, so the remaining sum `n - 52` must be assigned to the first letter, which is why `n - 53` is used (since 'a' corresponds to 1).
2. If `26 < n <= 52`, it constructs the word by placing `'a'` as the first letter, the letter corresponding to `n - 28` as the second letter, and `'z'` as the third letter. Here, `n - 28` is used because the first letter is fixed as `'a'` (1), and the third letter is fixed as `'z'` (26), so the remaining sum `n - 27` must be assigned to the second letter, which is why `n - 28` is used (since 'a' corresponds to 1).
3. If `n <= 26`, it constructs the word by placing `'aa'` as the first two letters and the letter corresponding to `n - 3` as the third letter. Here, `n - 3` is used because the first two letters are fixed as `'a'` (1 + 1), so the remaining sum `n - 2` must be assigned to the third letter, which is why `n - 3` is used (since 'a' corresponds to 1).

The logic above ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest by starting with the smallest possible letters and only increasing them when necessary.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided example:

- For `n = 24`, `24 <= 26`, so the word is `'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3]` which is `'aa' + 'r'` = `'aav'`.
- For `n = 70`, `70 > 52`, so the word is `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz'` which is `'r' + 'zz'` = `'rzz'`.
- For `n = 3`, `3 <= 26`, so the word is `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3]` which is `'aa' + 'a'` = `'aaa'`.
- For `n = 55`, `52 < 55 <= 78`, so the word is `'a' + alphabet[55 - 28] + 'z'` which is `'a' + 'c' + 'z'` = `'czz'`.
- For `n = 48`, `52 < 48 <= 78`, so the word is `'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z'` which is `'a' + 'u' + 'z'` = `'auz'`.

The output of the program matches the expected output, confirming that the logic is correct.

Correctness: **True**
