To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the loop and how it modifies the variables within its body. The loop reads an integer `t` which represents the number of iterations, then for each iteration, it reads another integer `n` and constructs a string `word` based on the value of `n`. The string `word` is then printed. 

The variables `t` and `n` are modified in each iteration, but `alphabet` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. After all iterations, the only state that changes is the printed output, which is not stored in any variable but is part of the output state.

The initial state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78
- `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English alphabet

The loop modifies `n` in each iteration by reading a new value, and constructs `word` based on this new `n`. The final output state will be a series of printed strings, one for each iteration of the loop. The values of `t` and `alphabet` remain unchanged.

Since the output of the loop is a series of printed strings and not stored in any variable, we describe the output state in terms of what gets printed.

Output State: **A series of printed strings, each constructed based on the value of `n` read in each iteration of the loop. The format of each printed string depends on the value of `n`: if `n > 52`, the string is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`; if `26 < n <= 52`, the string is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`; if `n <= 26`, the string is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.**
