Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `n` (an integer for each test case representing some value). `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78. The function returns a result for each test case based on the value of `n`.**
