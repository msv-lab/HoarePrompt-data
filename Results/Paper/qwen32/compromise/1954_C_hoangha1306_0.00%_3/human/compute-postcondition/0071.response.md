The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables; it merely moves the control back to the top of the loop for the next iteration.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `kq1`, `kq2`, `vt`, `q`, `i`, and the condition that the characters at index `i` of `a` and `b` are equal, the `continue` statement does not affect any of these variables. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is the first character of `a`, `kq2` is the first character of `a`, `vt` is 0, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, and the characters at index `i` of `a` and `b` are equal.**
