The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `kq2`. Given that `kq2` was initially an empty string and `a[i]` is a character from string `a`, after executing the code, `kq2` will contain that character.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `kq1` is the character at index `i` of `a`, `kq2` is the character at index `i` of `a`, `vt` is 0, `q` is `q + 1`. The characters at index `i` of `a` and `b` are equal.**
