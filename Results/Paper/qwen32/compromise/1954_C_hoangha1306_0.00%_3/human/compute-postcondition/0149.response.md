Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `q` is `q + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is `kq1` + `a[i]`, `kq2` remains unchanged, `vt` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to `kq1`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `q`, `i`, `kq2`, `vt`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
