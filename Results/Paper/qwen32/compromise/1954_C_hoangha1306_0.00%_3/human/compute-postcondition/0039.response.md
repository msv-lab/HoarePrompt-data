The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to `kq1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)`**.

In natural language, this means that the value of `kq1` is now the original `kq1` with the string representation of `y` appended to it, while all other variables retain their previous values.
