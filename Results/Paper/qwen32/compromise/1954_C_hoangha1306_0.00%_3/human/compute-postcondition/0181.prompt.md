Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, x and y have the same number of digits in each test case.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                if a[i] > b[i]:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is an input string; `b` is an input string; `kq1` is a string formed by the rules described; `kq2` is a string formed by the rules described; `vt` is 0 if no mismatches occurred, otherwise 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, `kq1` is a string constructed based on the rules described, `kq2` is a string constructed based on the rules described, `vt` is 1 if there was at least one mismatch between `a[i]` and `b[i]` during iterations, otherwise 0, `q` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: - `t`: Remains the same as the initial input integer.
- `a`: Remains the same as the initial input string.
- `b`: Remains the same as the initial input string.
- `kq1`: A string constructed by appending characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions described.
- `kq2`: A string constructed by appending characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions described.
- `vt`: 0 if all characters of `a` and `b` were equal, otherwise 1.
- `q`: `q + 1` (though `q` is not used further in the loop).

Output State:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
