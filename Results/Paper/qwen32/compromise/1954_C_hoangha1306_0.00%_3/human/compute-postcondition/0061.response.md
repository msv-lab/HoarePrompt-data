The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q` and the value of `t`. If `q` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is some value such that the loop has just finished executing for that value of `q`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `q` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is an input string; `b` is an input string; `kq1` is a string formed by the rules described; `kq2` is a string formed by the rules described; `vt` is 0 if no mismatches occurred, otherwise 1; `q` is incremented by 1**
