The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables' values or the loop's state directly; it simply moves the control back to the top of the loop for the next iteration.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `q`, `i`, `kq1`, `kq2`, `vt`, `x`, and `y` are described. Since the `continue` statement does not alter these variables, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `q` is `q + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with `a[i]`, `vt` is unchanged, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged.**
