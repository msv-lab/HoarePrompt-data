The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)` concatenates the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq2`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `vt`, `kq1`) are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `str(x)`, `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with `str(y)`**.
