Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `q` is `q + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `q` is `q + 1`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the character at index `i` of `a` and `vt` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is the smaller integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the larger integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. If `vt` was initially 0, it is now 1, and `kq1` is the string representation of `y` if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x` if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, otherwise `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. If `vt` was not initially 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `q` is `q + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both concatenated with `a[i]` and `vt` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `x` is the smaller integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the larger integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. If `vt` was originally 0, then `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` if `a[i] > b[i]` or with `str(x)` otherwise, and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)` if `a[i] > b[i]` or with `str(y)` otherwise, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` was not 0, then `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`, and `vt` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `q` is `q + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both concatenated with `a[i]` and `vt` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `x` is the smaller integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the larger integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` if `a[i] > b[i]` or with `str(x)` otherwise, and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)` if `a[i] > b[i]` or with `str(y)` otherwise. If `vt` was originally 0, it is set to 1; otherwise, `vt` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
