The code snippet assigns the minimum and maximum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b` to variables `x` and `y`, respectively. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the assignment, but since the increment is not part of the given snippet, we will consider the effect of the assignment only.

Given:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a` is a non-empty string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `i` is incremented by 1 before the assignment (not shown in the snippet).

The output state will reflect the values of `x` and `y` after the assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`.**
