The code snippet provided is:

```
kq2 = ''
```

This line of code sets the variable `kq2` to an empty string. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 1 if there was at least one mismatch between `a[i]` and `b[i]` during iterations, otherwise 0, `q` is `q + 1`.**
