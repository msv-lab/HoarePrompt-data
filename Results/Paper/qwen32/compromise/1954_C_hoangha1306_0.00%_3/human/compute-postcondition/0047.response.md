The code snippet assigns the minimum and maximum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b` to variables `x` and `y`, respectively. Given the initial state, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` and `y` are newly assigned.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `min(int(a[i-1]), int(b[i-1]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i-1]), int(b[i-1]))`**.
