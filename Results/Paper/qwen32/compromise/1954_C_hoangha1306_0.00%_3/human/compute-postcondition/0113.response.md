Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `vt` is 1. If `a[2] > b[2]`, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is `kq1` + str(y), and `kq2` is `kq2` + str(x).**
