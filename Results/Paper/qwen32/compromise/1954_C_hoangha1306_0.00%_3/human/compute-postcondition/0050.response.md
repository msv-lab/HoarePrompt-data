The code snippet appends the string representation of the variable `y` to the variable `kq2`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `vt` remain unchanged. The variable `kq1` is also unaffected by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change is to `kq2`, which now includes the string representation of `y` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `min(int(a[i-1]), int(b[i-1]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i-1]), int(b[i-1]))`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is `kq1 + str(x)`, `kq2` is `kq2 + str(y)`**.
