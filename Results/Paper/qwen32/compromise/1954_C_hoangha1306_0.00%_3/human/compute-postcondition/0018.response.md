The given code snippet appends the string representation of `y` to `kq2`. Since `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and we know that `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `y` is the integer value of `a[i]`.

Given the initial state, `kq2` is initially an empty string. After appending `str(y)` to `kq2`, `kq2` will contain the string representation of `y`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x`, `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y`, `vt` is 1, and the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal; `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i]`.**
