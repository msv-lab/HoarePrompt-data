The code snippet increments `kq2` by the character at index `i` of string `a`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `kq1`) remain unchanged except for `kq2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is `kq1` + `a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2` + `a[i]`**.
