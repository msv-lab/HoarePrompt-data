Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `vt` is 1. If `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` includes the string representation of `x` and `kq2` includes the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
