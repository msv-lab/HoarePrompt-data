The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the sorted list `a`. The result is derived by determining an effective maximum value `r` and adjusting it according to the remaining value of `k` after processing the list.
