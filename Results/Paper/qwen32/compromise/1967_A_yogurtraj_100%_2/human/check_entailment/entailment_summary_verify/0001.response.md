### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary. We will verify if the program correctly calculates the maximum score by ensuring that it correctly handles the logic of equalizing card counts and using the remaining coins optimally.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` types of cards, each with a certain number of cards (`a_i`).
- We can buy up to `k` additional cards.
- We need to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and the list `a` representing the counts of cards for each type.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This helps in making the smallest counts equal first, which is a greedy strategy to maximize the number of permutations.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The variable `r` is initialized to the smallest count in `a`.
   - The variable `rem` stores the remainder of coins after processing some counts.
   - The variable `y` stores the number of remaining types of cards after processing some counts.
   - The loop iterates through the sorted list `a` and tries to equalize the counts of the cards by using the available coins `k`.
     - If the cost to make the next `i+1` counts equal to the next count in the list exceeds `k`, it calculates how many more cards can be bought to make all counts equal up to `i` and then breaks out of the loop.
     - If the cost to make the next `i+1` counts equal to the next count in the list is within `k`, it subtracts the cost from `k` and updates `r` to the next count.
   - After the loop, if `k` is not zero, it means there are still coins left to buy more cards to increase the count of the largest type of card.
   - The final result is calculated based on the final count `r` and the remaining coins `k`.

#### Verification Using Function Summary:
- The function summary indicates that the program processes each test case by sorting the list `a` and then calculating the effective maximum value `r` by using the available coins `k` to equalize the counts as much as possible.
- The final result is derived by considering the final value of `r` and the remaining coins `k`.

#### Testing with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples to ensure it produces the correct output.

**Example 1:**
- Input: `1 10\n1`
