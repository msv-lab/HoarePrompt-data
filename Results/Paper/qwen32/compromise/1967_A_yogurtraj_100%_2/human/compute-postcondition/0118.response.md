Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is 4, `r` is `a[4]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 5`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
