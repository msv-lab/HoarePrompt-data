Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is `k - (n-1) * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0. If `k` is not equal to 0, `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `r` is `a[n-1]`.**
