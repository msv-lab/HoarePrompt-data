The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop. According to the `for` loop statement, `i` ranges from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by `1`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is 4.**
