The code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, so `i + 1` is 5. The value of `k` is not specified, so `rem` will be `k % 5`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is 4, `r` is `a[4] + k // 5`, `rem` is `k % 5`.**
