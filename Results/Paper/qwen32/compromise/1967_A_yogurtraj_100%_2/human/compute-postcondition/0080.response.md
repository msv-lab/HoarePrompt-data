Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `k` is not 0, `r` is `a[n - 1]` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` if the loop breaks, `rem` is 0 or `k % (i + 1)` if the loop breaks, `y` is 0 or `n - 1 - i` if the loop breaks, and `k` retains its non-zero value after all iterations.**
