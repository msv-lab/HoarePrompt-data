The code snippet `y = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `y`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**
