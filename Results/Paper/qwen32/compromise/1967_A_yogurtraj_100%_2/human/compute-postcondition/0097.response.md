The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. The values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, and the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer input, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
