The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` assigns the value of the element in the list `a` at index `i + 1` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `r` will be assigned the value of `a[3]`.

The variables `t`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, `i`, and `k` are mentioned in the initial state, but only `r` is affected by the given code snippet. The value of `k` is mentioned to be decreased by `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, but this operation is not part of the provided code snippet and thus does not affect the output state based on the given information.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is either 0 or `n - 2`, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, and `r` is `a[3]`.**
