The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted as it is already greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 1**
