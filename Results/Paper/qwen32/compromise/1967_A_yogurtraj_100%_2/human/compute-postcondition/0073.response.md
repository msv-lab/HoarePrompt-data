The code snippet `y = n - 1 - i` calculates the value of `y` based on the current values of `n` and `i`. Given that `n` is at least 4 and `i` is 3, the value of `y` will be `n - 4`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 3, `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`, `rem` is `k % 4`, `y` is `n - 4`.**
