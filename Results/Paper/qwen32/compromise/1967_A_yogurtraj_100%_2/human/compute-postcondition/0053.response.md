The code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)` and assigns it to `rem`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `rem`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Additionally, `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
