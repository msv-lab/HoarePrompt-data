The code snippet `rem = k % (i + 1)` calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged, and `rem` is introduced with a specific value based on the calculation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is 3, `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`, `rem` is `k % 4`.**
