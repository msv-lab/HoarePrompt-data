The code snippet provided sets the variable `rem` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `k`, `r`, `y`) are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the integer input for the number of elements in the list `a`, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer input, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0 or `n - 1 - i` if the loop breaks.**
