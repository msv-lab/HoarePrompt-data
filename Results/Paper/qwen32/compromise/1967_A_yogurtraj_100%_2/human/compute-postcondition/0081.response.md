The value of `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n`. The other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `k` is not 0, `r` is now `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0 or `k % (i + 1)` if the loop breaks, `y` is 0 or `n - 1 - i` if the loop breaks, and `k` retains its non-zero value after all iterations.
