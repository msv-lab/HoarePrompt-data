Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the original input string, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `data` starting from index 2, `cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `ans` is updated by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to its previous value if `v[i]` >= 3, `i` is 0. If `v[i]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged.**
