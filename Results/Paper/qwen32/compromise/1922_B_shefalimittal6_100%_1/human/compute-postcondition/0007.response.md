The code `n = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `n` by converting the string at the index `idx` in the `data` list to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `idx` is 1, `n` will be assigned the integer value of `data[1]`. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5` must still hold true after this assignment.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the original input string, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list**.
