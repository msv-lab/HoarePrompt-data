Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1`, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `2n + 3`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element is the count of the corresponding integer read from `data`, `cnt` is `0`, `ans` is `0`, `n` is a positive integer derived from `data[n + 2]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if v[i] >= 2:
        ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
    if v[i] >= 3:
        ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
    cnt += v[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1`, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 3` elements where `data[n + 2]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is `2n + 3`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element is the count of the corresponding integer read from `data`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `n` is a positive integer, and `i` is `0`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to `3`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least `0`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where `0 <= a_i <= n`, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 3` elements where `data[n + 2]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is `2n + 3`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element is the count of the corresponding integer read from `data`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `1`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[0] + v[1]`. If `v[i] >= 3`, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least `0`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where `0 <= a_i <= n`, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 3` elements where `data[n + 2]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is `2n + 3`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element is the count of the corresponding integer read from `data`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `2`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`. If `v[2] >= 3`, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
