Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n; `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the original input string; `idx` is 1; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    for _ in range(n):
        x = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v[x] += 1
    cnt = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if v[i] >= 2:
            ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
        if v[i] >= 3:
            ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
        cnt += v[i]
    results.append(str(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the original input string, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `data` starting from index 2, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for each `i` where `v[i] >= 2` and `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for each `i` where `v[i] >= 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 3` elements where `data[n + 2]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is `2n + 3`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and the string representation of `ans` again, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element is the count of the corresponding integer read from `data`, `cnt` is `sum(v)`, `ans` is the accumulated sum from all iterations of the loop, `n` is a positive integer, and `i` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings with at least n + 3 elements where `data[n + 2]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is 3n + 4, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` three times, `v` is a list of n + 1 zeros with `v[x]` incremented according to the values in `data` from index 2n + 4 to 3n + 3, `cnt` is the sum of all `v[i]` from `i = 0` to `i = n`, `ans` is the sum of contributions from each `v[i]` that meets the conditions inside the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is n.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
