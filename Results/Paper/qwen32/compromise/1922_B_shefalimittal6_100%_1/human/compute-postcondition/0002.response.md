The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `idx` to 0. It does not affect any other variables or the state of the input data. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `idx` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 <= a_i <= n; `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the original `input` string; `idx` is 0.**
