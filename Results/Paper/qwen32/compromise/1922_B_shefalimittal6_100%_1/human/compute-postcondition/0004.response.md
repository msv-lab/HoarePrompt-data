Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n; `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the original input string; `idx` is 1.**

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so it now holds the value 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
