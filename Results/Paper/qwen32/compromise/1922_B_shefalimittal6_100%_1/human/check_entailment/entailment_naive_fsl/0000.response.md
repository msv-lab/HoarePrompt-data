Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The current implementation seems to be counting combinations of sticks based on their lengths, but it does not incorporate the triangle inequality theorem, which is necessary to ensure that three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Specifically, for sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)), the following must hold true: \(a + b > c\).

The provided code does not check this condition. It only counts combinations of sticks based on their frequency, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements. 

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
- The lengths of the sticks are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^3 = 8\).
- To form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. However, \(2 + 4 \leq 8\), so these sticks cannot form a triangle.
- The provided code would count this combination as a valid set of sticks, leading to an incorrect result.

Thus, the program is **incorrect** as it does not properly implement the logic required to check the triangle inequality theorem.
