You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

    #State: t is 0; idx is 1 + t * (n + 1); results is a list containing the string representation of ans for each of the t iterations.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: (an empty string)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the frequency of each integer in the list and outputs this value for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The current implementation seems to be counting combinations of sticks based on their lengths, but it does not incorporate the triangle inequality theorem, which is necessary to ensure that three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Specifically, for sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)), the following must hold true: \(a + b > c\).

The provided code does not check this condition. It only counts combinations of sticks based on their frequency, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements. 

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
- The lengths of the sticks are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^3 = 8\).
- To form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. However, \(2 + 4 \leq 8\), so these sticks cannot form a triangle.
- The provided code would count this combination as a valid set of sticks, leading to an incorrect result.

Thus, the program is **incorrect** as it does not properly implement the logic required to check the triangle inequality theorem.
