The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates `int(input())` times, so the state that needs to be adjusted is the input that will be converted to an integer and used as the range for the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, we need to ensure that the input to the loop is `t`. This is because the loop will execute `t` times based on the input.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, the input to the loop is `t`**
