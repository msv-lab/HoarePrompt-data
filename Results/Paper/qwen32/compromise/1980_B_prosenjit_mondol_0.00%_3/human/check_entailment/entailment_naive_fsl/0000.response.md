Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the favorite cube is in a position where it might be removed or not removed depending on the exact sorting order of cubes with the same value. Specifically, the condition `elif a[k] < x` is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility that the favorite cube could be in a position that is not strictly less than `a[k]` but still within the first `k` cubes after sorting.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 2
3 3 3 3 3
```

**Explanation of the issue:**
- `n = 5`, `f = 2`, `k = 2`
- The array `a` is `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`
- The favorite cube has the value `3` and is initially at index `1` (0-based index).
- After sorting, the array remains `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
- The `k`-th cube (1-based index) is `a[1] = 3`, which is the same as the favorite cube.
- The program will output `'YES'` because `a[k] < x` is false and `a[k - 1] < x` is also false, leading to `'YES'`.
- However, the correct output should be `'MAYBE'` because the favorite cube could be any of the first `k` cubes, meaning it might be removed or not removed depending on its exact position.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.
