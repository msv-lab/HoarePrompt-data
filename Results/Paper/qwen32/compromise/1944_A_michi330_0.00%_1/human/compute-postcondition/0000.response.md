Output State: **`t` is an input integer, Each test case contains two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\). There are multiple test cases, with the first line containing the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3).**

In this state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer input by the user. The conditions and constraints on `n` and `k` for each test case remain unchanged.
