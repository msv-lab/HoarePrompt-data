Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether the sum of the elements in a specified sublist is greater than the count of elements in that sublist that are greater than 1. It outputs "YES" if the sum is greater and "NO" otherwise.**
