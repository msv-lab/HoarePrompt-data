Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program always outputs `k - 1` for every test case, regardless of the actual input values. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left in the hand depends on the distribution of card numbers and the value of `k`.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

While this specific input-output pair happens to be correct, the program will fail for other inputs. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
1 1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

However, for:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
1 1 1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

The program incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `3` for this input. The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards based on the given rules and input values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
