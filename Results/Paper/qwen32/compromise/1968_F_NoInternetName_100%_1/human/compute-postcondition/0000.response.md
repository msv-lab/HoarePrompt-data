Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `predicate` is a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value, `l` is 0, `r` is len(arr)**

In the output state, the variables `l` and `r` have been initialized. The variable `l` is set to 0, and `r` is set to the length of the list `arr`. The list `arr` and the function `predicate` remain unchanged.
