Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the winner of the game. The program only checks the parity (even or odd) of the sum of `a` and `b` and makes a decision based on that. However, the game's outcome depends on the optimal strategy of both players, which is not captured by simply checking the parity of the sum.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The current logic in the program is based on the sum of `a` and `b`. However, the game's outcome is determined by the strategy each player can employ. For example, if `a` and `b` are both 1, Bob wins, but the program would print "alice" because the sum is 2 (even).

2. **Loop Scope**: The `if-else` block is outside the loop, meaning it only considers the last test case. It should be inside the loop to evaluate each test case individually.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output should be exactly "Alice" or "Bob" without any extra spaces.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to analyze the game's strategy:
- If both `a` and `b` are equal, Bob wins because Alice will always be the one to face the situation where both wallets have 0 coins.
- If `a` and `b` are not equal, Alice can always make a move that keeps her in a winning position by ensuring Bob is left with the situation where both wallets have equal coins.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

Correctness: **False**
