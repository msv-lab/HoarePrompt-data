Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The game can be analyzed as follows:
- Alice and Bob take turns.
- Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not, and then must remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.
- Both players play optimally.

### Key Insight

The game's outcome can be determined by the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins \(a + b\):
- If \(a + b\) is even, Bob wins.
- If \(a + b\) is odd, Alice wins.

This is because the game always ends when the total number of coins reaches 0. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always be the one to make the last move, and thus Alice will be unable to make a move after that. Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will be the one to make the last move, and thus Bob will be unable to make a move after that.

### Program Analysis

Let's look at the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Indentation Error**: The `if` statement is incorrectly indented. It should be inside the loop to check each test case individually.
2. **Output Formatting**: The program prints 'bob  ' with two extra spaces, which does not match the expected output format. It should print 'Bob' without extra spaces.
3. **Variable Scope**: The variables `a` and `b` are defined inside the loop but are used outside the loop for the final `if` statement. This means only the last test case's values of `a` and `b` will be considered.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected version of the program is required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
