The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations remaining. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. Since `_` is incremented implicitly with each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is the value of `_`.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is the list of integers, and `max` is the maximum value among the minimums of consecutive pairs in the list `a`, and `_` is the current iteration index which has just finished. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1.**

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `max`) are not part of the loop head and do not change based on the loop control variable, they remain the same.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is the list of integers, and `max` is the maximum value among the minimums of consecutive pairs in the list `a`, and `_` is now the next iteration index (previously finished iteration index + 1).**
