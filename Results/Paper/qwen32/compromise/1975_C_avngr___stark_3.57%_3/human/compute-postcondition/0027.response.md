Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the current input, `i` is 2. If `min(a[2], a[1]) > max`, then `max` is updated to `min(a[2], a[1])`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
