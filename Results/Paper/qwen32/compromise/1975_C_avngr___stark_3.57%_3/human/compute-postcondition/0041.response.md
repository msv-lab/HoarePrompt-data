To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current index, and `_` was the next iteration index (which means `i` was incremented by 1).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is the list of integers.
- `max` is updated based on the condition `min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max`.

Since we are moving to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.
3. **Condition Check**: Ensure that `i` is still within the bounds of the loop, i.e., `i < n`.

Given that `n` is greater than 1 and the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`, we need to ensure that `i` does not exceed `n-1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `max` remains unchanged unless the condition `min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max` is met in this iteration.** 

However, since we are only adjusting the loop head variables (`i` and `n`), the final state is:

State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `i` is now `i + 1`.**
