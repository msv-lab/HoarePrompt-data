Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string provided by user input.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `x` is -1.
   - The function `func_1(s[0:])` returns `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The variables `s`, `n`, and `x` are defined, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The function `func_1(s[0:])` is called, but its return value (`False`) is not used or stored anywhere in the provided code snippet.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[0:])`.

Output: **YES**
