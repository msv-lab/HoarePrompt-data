In the given initial state, we have the following details:
- `s` is a string provided by user input.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `x` is -1.
- The function `func_1(s[0:])` returns `False`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(1)
```
This `print` statement is independent of the variables `s`, `n`, `x`, and the return value of `func_1(s[0:])`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **1**
