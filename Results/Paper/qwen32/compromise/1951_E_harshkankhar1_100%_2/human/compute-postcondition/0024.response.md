Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `s` is a string provided by user input.
2. `n` is the length of the string `s`.
3. `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
4. `i` is defined as the index of the first differing character, which is the same as `x`.
5. `x` is not equal to -1, meaning there is at least one character in the string different from the first character.
6. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.
7. `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
```

### Explanation:
- `s[:x + 2]` will output the substring of `s` from the beginning up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
- `s[x + 2:]` will output the substring of `s` from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of the string.

Since `x` is the index of the first character that is different from `s[0]`, `s[:x + 2]` will include the first character `s[0]` and the first differing character `s[x]` along with the character immediately following it `s[x + 1]`.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate:

- Suppose `s = "aaabbbccc"`.
- Then `n = 9`.
- The first character different from `s[0]` is `b` at index `x = 2`.
- `s[:x + 2]` would be `"aaab"`.
- `s[x + 2:]` would be `"bbccc"`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will split the string `s` into two parts at the index `x + 1` and print these two parts separated by a space.

Output: **s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] is the substring of s from the start to the character at index x + 1, and s[x + 2:] is the substring of s from the character at index x + 2 to the end)**

In a more specific format:

Output: **the substring from the start of s to the character at index x + 1, followed by a space, and then the substring from the character at index x + 2 to the end of s**
