Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is a string provided by user input.
2. `n` is the length of the string `s`.
3. `x` is -1.
4. The function `func_1(s[0:])` returns `False`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(s)` statement will output the string `s` as it is. The other variables (`n`, `x`, and the return value of `func_1`) are not used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output.

### Output:
Since `s` is the string provided by user input, the exact value of `s` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output will be the user-provided string `s`.

Output: **s (where s is the string provided by user input)**
