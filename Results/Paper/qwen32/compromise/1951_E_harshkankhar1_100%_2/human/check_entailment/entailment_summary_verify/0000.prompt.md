You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    s = input()
    (n, x) = (len(s), -1)
    if func_1(s[0:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads a string `s` from user input and checks certain conditions based on the characters in the string and the results of an external function `func_1`. It prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information depending on these conditions. The function does not return any value (it returns `None`).+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code fails to correctly partition the string into substrings that are not palindromes for certain inputs.

Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
abacaba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
3
aba cab a
```

**Actual Output of the Code:**
```
NO
```

Here's why the code fails this test case:
- The code first checks if the entire string is not a palindrome. Since "abacaba" is a palindrome, it proceeds to the next part.
- It then looks for the first character that is different from the first character of the string. In this case, it finds the character 'b' at index 1.
- The code then checks if the substring starting from index 2 to the end is not a palindrome. The substring "acaba" is a palindrome, so it proceeds to the next condition.
- Since the first different character is at index 1 (which is `x == 1`), the code incorrectly concludes that no valid partition exists and prints "NO".

This is just one example of how the code fails to correctly partition the string. There are likely other edge cases where the code does not work as expected. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

If you need further examples or a more detailed analysis, feel free to ask!
