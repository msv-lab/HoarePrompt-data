The provided Python code snippet contains a `print(1)` statement. This statement directly prints the integer `1` to the console. The value to be printed is explicitly given and does not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
- The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`), but these are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print(1)` statement is independent of the initial state and simply outputs the number `1`.

Therefore, the output of the code is:

Output: **1**
