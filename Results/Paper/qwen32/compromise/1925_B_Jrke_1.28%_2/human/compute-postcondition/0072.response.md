To determine the output, we need to break down the given initial state and understand how the variables are defined and calculated.

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`. This variable represents the number of test cases, but it is not directly used in the given code snippet. Therefore, we can ignore it for this specific print statement.

2. **Variable `x`**: It is the first integer from the input. This is a specific integer value provided as input to the program.

3. **Variable `n`**: It is the second integer from the input. This is another specific integer value provided as input to the program.

4. **Variable `k`**: It is calculated as `x // n`. This means `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, which is the largest integer `q` such that `n * q <= x`.

5. **Variable `ans`**: It is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. A divisor of `x` is a number that divides `x` without leaving a remainder. We need to find the largest such divisor that is also less than or equal to `k`.

Given the above descriptions, the print statement `print(ans)` will output the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to k)**
