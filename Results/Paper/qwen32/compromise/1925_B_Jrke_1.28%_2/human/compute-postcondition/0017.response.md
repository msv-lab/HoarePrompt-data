Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`). `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. `l` is `[1, x // i]` if `i > k`, or `[1, i, x // i]` if `i <= k`. `x % i == 0`, meaning `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, if `x // i <= k`, `l` includes `x // i` in its elements.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`, while all other variables remain as they were initially described.
