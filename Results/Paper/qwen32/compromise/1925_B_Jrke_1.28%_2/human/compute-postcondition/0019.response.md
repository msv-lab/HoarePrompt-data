To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables defined in the loop head: `i`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Let's break down the loop parameters:
- The starting value of `i` is `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`. This means if `x` is even, the loop starts at `2`, otherwise, it starts at `1`.
- The loop runs up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- The step is `2`, meaning `i` increments by `2` in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `n` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`).
- `ans` is determined based on whether `x % i == 0` and the values in list `l`.

To find the state at the start of the next iteration:
- The only variable that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the end of the last iteration, `i` had a certain value.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by `2` (as per the loop definition).

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Then, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i_prev + 2`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), and `ans` is determined based on the conditions given.

State at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be `i_prev + 2`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can represent the state as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), `ans` is determined based on the conditions given, `i` is `i_prev + 2`**

However, if we assume `i_prev` is the last value of `i` from the previous iteration, then we can express the next state as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), `ans` is determined based on the conditions given, `i` is `i + 2`**

But to be precise without assuming `i_prev`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), `ans` is determined based on the conditions given, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 2**

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can't provide a numerical value, but we can express the state as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), `ans` is determined based on the conditions given, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 2**

To provide a more concrete example, let's assume `i` was `3` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), `ans` is determined based on the conditions given, `i` is 5**

However, without the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, the most accurate representation is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), `ans` is determined based on the conditions given, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 2**

So, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), `ans` is determined based on the conditions given, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 2**
