Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, and `k` is `x // n`. If `k` equals 1, then `k` equals 1. Otherwise, there is no change to `k`. `ans` is 1. `l` is `[1]`. `x % i == 0`, meaning `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
