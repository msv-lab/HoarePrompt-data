To determine what will be printed, we need to break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Provided:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This indicates the number of test cases.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `n` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is calculated as `x // n` (integer division of `x` by `n`).
- `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Inputs and Calculation of `k`:**
   - `x` and `n` are read from the input.
   - `k` is calculated as the integer division of `x` by `n` (`k = x // n`).

2. **Finding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - To find `ans`, we need to identify all divisors of `x` and select the largest one that does not exceed `k`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the values of `x` and `n` for a concrete example:
- Suppose `x = 24` and `n = 5`.
- Calculate `k`: \( k = 24 // 5 = 4 \).
- Now, find the divisors of `x` (24): 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.
- The divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k` (which is 4) are: 1, 2, 3, 4.
- The maximum divisor among these is 4.
- Therefore, `ans` would be 4.

### General Case:
Given the above steps, the value of `ans` will always be the largest divisor of `x` that does not exceed `k`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to k)**
