Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to divide a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems with positive integer difficulties such that the sum of these difficulties is `x` and the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of these difficulties is maximized.

### Key Observations:
1. **Maximum GCD**: The maximum GCD of the difficulties can be at most `x // n` because if any difficulty is greater than `x // n`, the sum of `n` such difficulties would exceed `x`.
2. **Checking Divisors**: To maximize the GCD, we need to check if `x` can be split into `n` parts such that the GCD of these parts is a divisor of `x`. The program checks divisors of `x` to find the largest possible GCD.
3. **Efficiency**: The program efficiently checks divisors up to the square root of `x` to find the maximum GCD.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
2. **Initial GCD Calculation**: It calculates `k = x // n`. If `k == 1`, it immediately prints `1` because the only possible difficulties are all `1`, and their GCD is `1`.
3. **Finding Maximum GCD**: The program then iterates over possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:
   - If `i` is a divisor of `x` and `i <= k`, it considers `i` as a possible GCD.
   - If `x // i` is a divisor of `x` and `x // i <= k`, it considers `x // i` as a possible GCD.
   - It keeps track of the maximum GCD found.
4. **Output**: For each test case, it prints the maximum GCD found.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems. It efficiently checks divisors of `x` and ensures that the sum of the difficulties can be exactly `x` with the maximum possible GCD. The edge cases, such as when `k == 1`, are handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem description.

**Correctness: True**
