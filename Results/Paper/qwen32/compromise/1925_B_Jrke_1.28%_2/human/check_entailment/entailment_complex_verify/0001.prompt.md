You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each of the t test cases, the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to k (where k = x // n) has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n` and prints this value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to divide a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems is `x`. The goal is to maximize the balance, which is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.

### Key Observations:
1. **GCD Calculation**: The balance of the problemset is the GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems. To maximize the GCD, the difficulties of the sub-problems should be as large as possible while still summing up to `x`.
2. **Constraints**: The difficulties of the sub-problems must be positive integers and their sum must be `x`. The number of sub-problems `n` must be less than or equal to `x`.
3. **Optimal Solution**: The optimal way to maximize the GCD is to find the largest possible divisor of `x` that can be used as a base difficulty for the sub-problems. This divisor should be as large as possible while still allowing the sum of `n` such difficulties to be `x`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program iterates over possible divisors of `x` to find the largest one that can be used to divide `x` into `n` sub-problems. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
2. **Base Case**: If `k = x // n` is 1, it means that the only way to divide `x` into `n` parts is to have each part with difficulty 1, so the GCD is 1.
3. **Finding Maximum GCD**: The program iterates over possible divisors of `x` starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is even) up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:
   - If `i` is a divisor of `x` and `i <= k`, it is considered as a potential GCD.
   - If `x // i` is a divisor of `x` and `x // i <= k`, it is also considered as a potential GCD.
   - The program keeps track of the maximum GCD found.

### Correctness of the Program:
The program correctly finds the largest possible divisor of `x` that can be used as the base difficulty for the sub-problems, ensuring that the sum of the difficulties is `x` and the number of sub-problems is `n`. The program efficiently checks divisors up to the square root of `x`, which is a reasonable approach given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
