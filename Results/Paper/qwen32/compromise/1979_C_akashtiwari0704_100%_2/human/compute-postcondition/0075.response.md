The code snippet appends the string representation of the element at index `i` of the list `a` followed by a space to the string `ans`.

Given the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, the element at index `i` (which is `a[2]`) will be appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 1, `g` is 1, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are modified to `prod // a[i]` for i from 0 to `bets-1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a` list, `ans` is a string containing the first element of `a` followed by a space and then the second element of `a` followed by a space and then the third element of `a` followed by a space, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 2, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.**

In simple terms, `ans` now includes the third element of `a` followed by a space, in addition to the first two elements of `a` that were already in `ans`.
