The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `l`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Since `g` and `l` are not part of the loop head, they should remain unchanged in terms of the loop's control flow. However, their values are updated within the loop body, which is not shown here.

State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`** 

To be more specific, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`** 

Given the context, let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `x + 1`**

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize it as `i + 1` where `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration. For the sake of clarity in the context of the loop control, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` from its previous value.

State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`**

To make it more concrete, if `i` was 0 at the start and 1 at the end of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `i` should be 2, and so on.

State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`**

Given the loop control, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since we need to specify a concrete next state, let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

For the sake of a concrete example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 3**

However, without the specific value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the most accurate generalization is:

State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`**
