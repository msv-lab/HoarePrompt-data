The code provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. This means that the list `a` will now contain the integers input by the user, and its length will be equal to the number of integers provided in the input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `T`, `g`, and `bets`) are not affected by this line of code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `bets` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**
