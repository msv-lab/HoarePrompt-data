Given the code snippet and the initial state, let's break down the impact of the code on the program:

Initial State: `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`
```python
g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
```

The code modifies the value of `g` based on its current value, the value at index `i` in the list `l`, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`.

Output State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`**

In natural language: The list `l` retains its elements, `i` remains `i + 1`, and the variable `g` is updated to the result of the expression `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
