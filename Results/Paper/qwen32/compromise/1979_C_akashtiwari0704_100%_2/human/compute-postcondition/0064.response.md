The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the variable `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `sumo` will be incremented by `a[2]`.

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 1, `g` is 1, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`, and `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is `a[0] + a[1]`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of each of the first `bets` elements of `a` separated by spaces, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 2.

After executing the code snippet, `sumo` is updated to `sumo + a[2]`. Therefore, the new value of `sumo` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 1, `g` is 1, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`, and `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of each of the first `bets` elements of `a` separated by spaces, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 2.**
