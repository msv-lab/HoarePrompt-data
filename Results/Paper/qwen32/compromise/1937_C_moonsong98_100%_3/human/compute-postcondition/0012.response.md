To determine the state before the for loop starts that ensures the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `min_indices`, so we need to ensure that `min_indices` is a list with at least one element. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop iterates over `min_indices`, which means the state of `min_indices` needs to be adjusted.
2. **Condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `min_indices` contains at least one element.
3. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `min_indices` is a list with at least one element. Since `min_index` is defined as the first element of `min_indices`, we can adjust `min_indices` to contain at least one element.

Given the provided state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2.
- `max_index` is `n-1`.
- `min_indices` is a list containing all indices that are considered equal to `max_index` by `func_1`.
- `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `min_indices` has at least one element. Let's assume that `func_1` is such that it includes at least one index in `min_indices` (which is a reasonable assumption given the context).

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `min_indices` should be a list with at least one element.
- `min_index` should be the first element of `min_indices`.

Since we don't have specific details about `func_1` and its behavior, we will assume that `min_indices` will contain at least one element based on the problem statement.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is n-1, `min_indices` is a list with at least one element, `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`**
