The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is already an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and it is not equal to 2, the loop will definitely execute without needing to adjust `n`.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so there is no need to adjust its state before the loop starts.

The variables `max_index` and `min_indices` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect whether the loop executes. However, to ensure consistency with the given state, we should keep them as they are.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `max_index` is n-1; `min_indices` is a list containing the single element `max_index`**
