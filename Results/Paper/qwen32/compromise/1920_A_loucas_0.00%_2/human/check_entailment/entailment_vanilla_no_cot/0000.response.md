Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all the given constraints. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Range:**
   - The program calculates the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)`, but it does not include the endpoints. The correct range should include both `max(big)` and `min(less)` if they satisfy all constraints.
   - The program breaks after finding the first valid \( k \) and prints it, which is incorrect. It should count all valid \( k \) values within the range.

2. **Handling of "Not Equal" Constraints:**
   - The program checks if \( i \) is not in the `no` list, but it does not correctly count all valid \( k \) values.

3. **Output:**
   - The program should print the count of valid \( k \) values, not just one valid \( k \) value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for _ in range(loop):
        less = float('inf')
        big = float('-inf')
        no = set()
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for _ in range(innerLoop):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                big = max(big, x)
            elif a == 2:
                less = min(less, x)
            else:
                no.add(x)
        count = 0
        for i in range(big, less + 1):
            if i not in no:
                count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all the constraints by:
- Using `max(big)` and `min(less)` to determine the inclusive range.
- Using a set for `no` to efficiently check if a number is not equal to any of the excluded values.
- Counting all valid \( k \) values within the range and printing the count.
