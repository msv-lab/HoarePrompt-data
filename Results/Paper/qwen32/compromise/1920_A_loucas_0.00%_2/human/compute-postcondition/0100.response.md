The code snippet `innerLoop = int(input())` will change the value of `innerLoop` to the integer value provided by the user input. The values of the other variables (`num`, `iterable`, `loop`, `big`, `less`, and `no`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is 0; `iterable` is `iterable + 1`; `loop` remains unchanged; `innerLoop` is an input integer; `big` is an empty list; `less` is an empty list; `no` is an empty list.**
