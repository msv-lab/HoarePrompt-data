Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `a` are integers read from the input, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `big` is a list containing at least one integer, `less` is a list containing at least one integer such that `max(big) < min(less)`. If `i` is not in the list `no`, then `num` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `num`.**
