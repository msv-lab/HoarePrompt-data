Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is 0; `iterable` is `iterable + 1`; `loop` remains unchanged; `innerLoop` is an input integer; `big` is an empty list; `less` is an empty list; `no` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num` is 0, `iterable` is a valid integer (e.g., 0), `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `loop` remains unchanged, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the input integer `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the input integer `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` is a list containing the input integer `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is 0, `iterable` is a valid integer, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `loop` remains unchanged, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1, `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 2, and `no` is a list containing `a` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2. If `x` is not 2, `no` includes `a` regardless of the initial condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is 0, `iterable` is a valid integer, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `loop` remains unchanged, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `big` is a list containing `a` at least once (twice if `x` is 1), `less` is a list containing `a` once if `x` is not 2 or twice if `x` is 2, and `no` is a list containing `a` at least once and possibly more times if `x` is neither 1 nor 2. If `x` is not 2, `no` includes `a` regardless of the initial condition, `iterable2` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
