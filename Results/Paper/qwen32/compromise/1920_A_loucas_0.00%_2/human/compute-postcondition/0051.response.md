The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `no`. This operation does not affect the values of `num`, `iterable`, `loop`, `less`, or `big`. Therefore, the only change is that `no` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`num` is set to the first integer in the range [max(big), min(less)) that is not in `no`, or 0 if no such integer exists, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` remains unchanged, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list.**
