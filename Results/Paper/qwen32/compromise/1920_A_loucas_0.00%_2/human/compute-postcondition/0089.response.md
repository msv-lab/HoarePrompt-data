The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `max(big)`, and `min(less)`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented again, and it must still be within the range `[max(big), min(less))`.

Given the condition in the loop body, if `i` is not in the set `no`, then `num` is set to `i + 1` and we break out of the loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `num` and the loop continues. This condition does not affect the loop's iteration over `i`, so we only need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the last iteration, so for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2`.
- `max(big)` and `min(less)` remain unchanged as they define the range of the loop.

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `max(big)` is unchanged, `min(less)` is unchanged**
