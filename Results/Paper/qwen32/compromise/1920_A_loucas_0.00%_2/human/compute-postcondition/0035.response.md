The code snippet `num = i` assigns the value of `i` to `num`. The initial state specifies that `i` is not in the list `no`, but it does not specify the exact value of `i`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `num` will have the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `a` are integers read from the input, `num` is `i`, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `big` is a list containing at least one integer, `less` is a list containing at least one integer such that `max(big) < min(less)`, and `i` is not in the list `no`.**
