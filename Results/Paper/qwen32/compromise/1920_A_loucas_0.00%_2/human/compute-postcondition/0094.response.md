Based on the given initial state, let's break down the value of `num`:

- `num` is determined by finding the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in the set `no`.
- If no such value exists, `num` remains 0.

However, the exact values of `big`, `less`, and `no` are not provided, so we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `num`. We can only describe `num` based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the output of the `print(num)` statement will be:

Output: **num (where num is the first value i in the range from max(big) to min(less) - 1 that is not in the set no, or 0 if no such value exists)**
