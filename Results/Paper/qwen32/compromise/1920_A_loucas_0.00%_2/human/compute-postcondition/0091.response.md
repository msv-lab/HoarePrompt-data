The code provided is a `break` statement, which does not affect the values of any variables. The variables `i`, `max(big)`, `min(less)`, and `num` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `max(big)` is unchanged, `min(less)` is unchanged, `num` is `i + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
