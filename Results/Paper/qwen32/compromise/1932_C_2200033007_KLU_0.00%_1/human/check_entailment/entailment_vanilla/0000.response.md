Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an array `a` of length `n`, an integer `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'.
- For each command in `s`, we need to:
  1. Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m`.
  2. If the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from `a`.
  3. If the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from `a`.

### Provided Program:
The program reads the input, processes each test case, and uses a function `func_1` to compute the required remainders.

#### `func_1` Function:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `b = []`: This list is intended to store the elements of `a` in the order they are removed based on the commands in `s`.
   - `l = 0` and `r = n - 1`: These are pointers to the leftmost and rightmost elements of `a`.

2. **Processing Commands**:
   - The loop iterates over each command in `s`.
   - If the command is 'L', the leftmost element (`a[l]`) is appended to `b`, and `l` is incremented.
   - If the command is 'R', the rightmost element (`a[r]`) is appended to `b`, and `r` is decremented.

3. **Calculating Remainders**:
   - `ans = []`: This list will store the remainders of the product of elements in `b`.
   - `p = 1`: This variable is used to keep track of the product of elements.
   - The loop iterates over `b` in reverse order (since elements were appended in the order they were removed).
   - For each element `v` in reversed `b`, `p` is updated to `p * v`, and the result is appended to `ans`.
   - Finally, `reversed(ans)` is returned.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires.
   - The problem specifies that for each command, we need the remainder of the product of the current state of `a` (not `b`), not the product of the elements that were removed.

2. **Incorrect Order of Outputs**:
   - The final output should be in the order of commands, not the reverse order of commands.

### Correct Approach:
- For each command, calculate the product of the current state of `a` and take the remainder when divided by `m`.
- Update `a` by removing the leftmost or rightmost element based on the command.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it calculates the product of removed elements in reverse order instead of the product of the current state of `a`.

**Correctness: False**
