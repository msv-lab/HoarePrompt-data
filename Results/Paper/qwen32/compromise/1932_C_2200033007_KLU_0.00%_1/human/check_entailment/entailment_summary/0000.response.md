Reasoning:

The provided Python program is incorrect based on the problem description and the given execution summary. Here's why:

1. **Misinterpretation of Commands**: The function `func_1` incorrectly interprets the commands. The commands 'L' and 'R' are supposed to remove elements from the array `a` as they are processed, and the product of the remaining elements should be calculated after each command. However, the function `func_1` constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the commands, which does not reflect the actual removal of elements from `a`.

2. **Product Calculation**: The function calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order and then reverses the result to get the final output. This approach does not correctly simulate the removal of elements from the original array `a` and the calculation of the product of the remaining elements after each command.

3. **Output Requirement**: The problem requires the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` to be output at each step before any element is removed. The provided program does not achieve this.

To correct the program, we need to calculate the product of all elements in `a` initially and then update this product as elements are removed according to the commands. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    result = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    
    for command in s:
        result.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[left], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove the leftmost element
            left += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[right], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove the rightmost element
            right -= 1
    
    print(*result)
```

In this corrected version:
- We first calculate the product of all elements in `a` and take the remainder when divided by `m`.
- We then iterate through the commands, updating the product by removing the appropriate element (using modular multiplicative inverse for division in modular arithmetic).
- We append the current product (remainder) to the result list after each command.

Correctness: **False**
