Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It also accepts a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The function returns a list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of the elements in another list `b` in their original order. The list `b` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, so it is assumed to be derived from the inputs `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` in a manner not specified here. The reversed list `ans` is then returned.**
