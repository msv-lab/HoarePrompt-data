Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'; The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5; `b` is an empty list; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `r` has been assigned the value `n - 1`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
