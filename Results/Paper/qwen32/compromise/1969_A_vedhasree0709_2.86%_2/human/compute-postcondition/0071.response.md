Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `j`, `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. The code snippet `break` causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is contained within.
