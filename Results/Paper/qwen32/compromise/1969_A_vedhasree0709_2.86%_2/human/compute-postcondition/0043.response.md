Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and the current value of `l[i]` is `i + 2` and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is `i + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `i`, `n`, or `l`. It only exits the current loop or if statement. The conditions and values remain as specified in the initial state.
