Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each integer `p_i` is between 1 and `n` and not equal to `i`. The function returns the number of fixed points in the permutation `p` for each test case. A fixed point is an index `i` such that `p_i` is equal to `i`.**
