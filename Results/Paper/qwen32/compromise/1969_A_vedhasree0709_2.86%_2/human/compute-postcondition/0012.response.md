The `while` loop in the provided code will continue to execute as long as the condition `i <= n - 1` is true. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` if necessary. 

Let's break it down:

- The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently 1, `n` must be at least 2 to ensure the condition `1 <= n - 1` is true.

No other variables in the loop condition need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 2, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1**
