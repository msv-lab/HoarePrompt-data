Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is at least 2, `l` is a list of integers, and `i` is 1. If `l[1]` equals 3 and `l[2]` equals 2, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `j` or the loop/condition is not broken out of.**
