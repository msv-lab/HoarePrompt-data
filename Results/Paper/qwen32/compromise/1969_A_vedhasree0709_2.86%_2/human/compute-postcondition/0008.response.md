Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a list of integers; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been changed to 1. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
