The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`. The values of `j`, `i`, and `n` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`j` is 0 and `i` is `n`, or `j` is 1 and `i` is the index where the condition was met; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
