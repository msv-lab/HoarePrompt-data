The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range is determined by `int(input())`. This means that the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `p` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1 because the loop will run `t` times. Since `t` is already given as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
