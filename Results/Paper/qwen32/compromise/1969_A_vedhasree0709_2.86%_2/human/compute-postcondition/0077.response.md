Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, and `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `j`, `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. The program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but no other variables are affected.
