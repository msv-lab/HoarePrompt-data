In the given task, the for loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. The variables in the loop head are `num` and `arr`. The state of `arr` is already provided as a list of integers, and `num` is the variable that will take on the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration of the loop. 

The variable `k` and the dictionary `frequency_table` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. The loop will execute as long as `arr` has at least one element.

Given this, the state before the loop starts needs to ensure that `arr` has at least one integer to iterate over. The values of `k` and `frequency_table` do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 100), `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**
