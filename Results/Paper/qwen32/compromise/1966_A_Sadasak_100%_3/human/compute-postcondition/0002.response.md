Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number on a card, and `k` is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange in each operation. The length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr` and its value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.**
