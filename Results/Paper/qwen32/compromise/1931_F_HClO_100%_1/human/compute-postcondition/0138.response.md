The code snippet creates a new list `l11` that contains elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, and `l2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `t` is such that `n` is less than `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`.**
