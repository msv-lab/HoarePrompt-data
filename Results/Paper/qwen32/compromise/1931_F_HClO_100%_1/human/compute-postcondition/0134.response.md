Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `t` is such that `n` is less than `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but instructs the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `_`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
