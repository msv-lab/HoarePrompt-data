To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided information and the conditions under which it operates.

### Loop Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `n-1` iterations.
2. **Break Condition**: The loop breaks if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`.
3. **Comparison Logic**: 
   - If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`:
     - If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, and the loop breaks.
     - If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is incremented by 1.
     - If `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is incremented by 1.
4. **Variables**:
   - `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `_`, `t`, `n`, `m` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `i` increments by 1 each iteration.
   - `p1` and `p2` can be incremented based on the comparison logic.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` can be set to `i` based on the comparison logic.

### Final Output State:

The loop will iterate until either `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative. Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the loop will terminate when one of these conditions is met.

Let's assume the loop completes all `n-1` iterations without breaking due to the conditions inside the loop. This means that `idx1` and `idx2` never become non-negative simultaneously, and `i + max(p1, p2)` never equals `n - 1` during the iterations.

### Final State:

- `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `_`, `t`, `n`, `m` remain the same as the initial state.
- `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes.
- `p1` and `p2` will be determined by the comparisons made during the iterations.
- `idx1` and `idx2` will remain `-1` if they were never set to a non-negative value during the iterations.

### Output State:

Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` is the value read from the input, `m` is the value read from the input, `i` is `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` are determined by the comparisons made during the iterations, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.** 

In simpler terms, the loop completes all its iterations without finding a match that sets `idx1` and `idx2` to non-negative values, and `i` reaches `n-1`. The values of `p1` and `p2` depend on the specific comparisons made during the iterations, but `idx1` and `idx2` remain `-1`.
