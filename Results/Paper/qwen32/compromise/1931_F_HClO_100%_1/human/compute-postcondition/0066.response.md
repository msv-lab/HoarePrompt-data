The given code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `p1`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `p1` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 5, `m` is an integer read from the input (and must be at least 3 if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`), `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, and `i` is 5; `idx1` is 5; `p1` is 1.**
