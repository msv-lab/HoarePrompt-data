The code reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a1` while the rest are collected into the list `l1`. The values of `t` and `m` remain unchanged unless `m` is modified elsewhere in the code, which is not shown here.

Given that `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, and `m` retains its value if it is 1, these values are not altered by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `m` is 1, then the current value of `m` remains 1; `a1` is the first integer from the next input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line.**
