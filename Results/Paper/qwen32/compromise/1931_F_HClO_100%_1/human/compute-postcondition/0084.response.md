The code snippet `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to the variable `l`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, `l2` is a list containing elements from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`. Therefore, after the assignment, `l` will also be this same list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the next input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list containing elements from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration); `val` is an empty list; `l` is a list containing elements from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.**
