Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; if `m` equals 2, the state of the variables remains unchanged as per the if part postcondition; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as per the precondition since there is no else part.**
