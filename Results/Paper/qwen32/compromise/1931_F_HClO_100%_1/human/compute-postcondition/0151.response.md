Output State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding any elements that are equal to `a1`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0.**

Explanation: The values of `p1` and `p2` have been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
