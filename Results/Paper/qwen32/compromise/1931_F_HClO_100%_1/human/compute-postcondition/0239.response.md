To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just the variable `_`.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will iterate as long as `_` is less than `m - 2`.

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `_` is `_ + 1`
- `t` is such that `_ + 1` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged except `m` must be greater than 2
- `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged
- `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged
- `idx1` is not `-1`
- If `idx1 < idx2`, then `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` and `idx1` is less than `idx2 + 1`
- If `idx1 > idx2`, then `idx2` is `n - 2` and `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `n - 2`
- If `idx1 <= idx2`, then `m` is 1, `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (4, [5, 6, 7]), (a3, l3)]`
- `a3` is the first integer from the input
- `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the input

Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, if `_` was `_ + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `_ + 2` at the start of the next iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`_` is `_ + 2`, `t` is such that `_ + 2` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged except `m` must be greater than 2; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; If `idx1 < idx2`, then `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` and `idx1` is less than `idx2 + 1`; If `idx1 > idx2`, then `idx2` is `n - 2` and `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `n - 2`; If `idx1 <= idx2`, then `m` is 1, `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (4, [5, 6, 7]), (a3, l3)]`; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the input.**
