Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` equal to 2.
- `a1` is the first integer from the next input line.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line.
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input line.
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
- `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
- `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`.
- `idx2` is not -1.
- `p1` is 0.
- `p2` is 0.
- The loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration).
- `val` is an empty list.
- `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.

The code snippet provided is simply:
```python
print('yes')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It directly outputs the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **yes**
