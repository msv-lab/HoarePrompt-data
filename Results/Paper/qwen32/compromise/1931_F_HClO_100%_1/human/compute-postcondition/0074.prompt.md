Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; if `m` is 1, it remains 1; `a1` is the first integer from the next input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be at least 3; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer read from the input (and must be at least 3 if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`), `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `idx1` and `idx2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 5, `m` is an integer read from the input (and must be at least 3 if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`), `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`. `i` is 4. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is set to 4 and `idx2` is set to 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is set to 4; if `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx2` is set to 4. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, no changes are made to `idx1` and `idx2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 5, `m` is an integer read from the input (and must be at least 3 if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`), `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, and `i` is 5. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no additional changes are made. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is set to 5, `idx2` is set to 5, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
