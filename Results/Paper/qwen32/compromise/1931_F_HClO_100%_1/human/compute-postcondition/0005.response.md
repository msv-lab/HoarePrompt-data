Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
  - The current value of `m` is explicitly set to 1.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  print('yes')
  ```

The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'yes'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **yes**
