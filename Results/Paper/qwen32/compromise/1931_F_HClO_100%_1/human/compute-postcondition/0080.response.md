Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the next input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` is `n - 2`; `idx2` is `n - 2`; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration); `val` is an empty list. The condition `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1` is false.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `idx2` has been updated to `n - 2`. All other variables retain their previous values. The condition `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1` is no longer true because `idx2` is now `n - 2`.
