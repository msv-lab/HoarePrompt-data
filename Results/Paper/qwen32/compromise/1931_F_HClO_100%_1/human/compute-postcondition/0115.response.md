To determine the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how it modifies the state variables. The loop iterates `m - 2` times, appending tuples `(a3, l3)` to the `val` list, where `a3` is the first integer from the input line and `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the same input line.

### Loop Analysis
- **Initialization**: 
  - `val` is initially an empty list if `idx1 < idx2`, or it contains one element `(a3, l3)` if `idx1 > idx2`.
  - The loop runs `m - 2` times.

- **Loop Body**:
  - For each iteration, the loop reads a new input line, splits it into `a3` (first integer) and `l3` (remaining integers).
  - It appends the tuple `(a3, l3)` to the `val` list.

### Final State Calculation
- After `m - 2` iterations, the `val` list will contain `m - 1` tuples if `idx1 < idx2`, or `m` tuples if `idx1 > idx2`.

### Given Conditions
- The loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration).
- The initial state of `val` is described based on the condition of `idx1` and `idx2`.

### Final Output State
- Since the loop runs `m - 2` times, and assuming the initial state of `val` is correctly set up based on the conditions provided, the final `val` list will have `m - 1` elements if `idx1 < idx2`, or `m` elements if `idx1 > idx2`.

### Conclusion
The final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations is as follows:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
- `val` will contain `m - 1` elements if `idx1 < idx2`, or `m` elements if `idx1 > idx2`.

### Final Output State in Specified Format
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is at least 3, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1 >= idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration), `val` contains `m - 1` elements if `idx1 < idx2`, or `m` elements if `idx1 > idx2`, each element being a tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.**
