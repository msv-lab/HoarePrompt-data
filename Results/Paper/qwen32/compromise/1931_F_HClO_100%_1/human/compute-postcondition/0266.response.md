The code snippet modifies `l22` by filtering out any occurrences of `a1` from `l2`. Given that `l2` is initially `[13, 14, 15]`, the new `l22` will only exclude `a1` if `a1` is one of these values. Otherwise, `l22` will remain unchanged.

Since the initial state specifies that `a1` is the first integer from the input and `l2` is `[13, 14, 15]`, `l22` will be updated to exclude `a1` if `a1` is 13, 14, or 15. If `a1` is any other value, `l22` will remain `[13, 14, 15]`.

Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and `x + 1 < t`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` are the values read from the input; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx1 <= idx2`.**
