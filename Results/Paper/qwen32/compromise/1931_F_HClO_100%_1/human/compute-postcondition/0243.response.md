To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `val`, which is a list of tuples. The loop will execute if `val` contains at least one tuple.

Let's break down the conditions and required adjustments:

1. **Initialization of `val`:**
   - If `idx1 <= idx2`, then `m` is set to 1, and `val` is initialized to `[(4, [5, 6, 7])]` followed by `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`.
   - Since `m` is 1, `m - 2` is `-1`, meaning no additional tuples are added after the initial one. Therefore, `val` will be `[(4, [5, 6, 7])]`.

2. **Ensuring `val` has at least one tuple:**
   - For the loop to execute, `val` must contain at least one tuple. Given the conditions, if `idx1 <= idx2`, `val` will indeed contain one tuple.

3. **Adjustments needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `idx1 <= idx2` so that `val` is initialized with at least one tuple.
   - The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, and the conditions involving `idx1` and `idx2` for modifying lists `l1` and `l2`) do not directly affect the initialization of `val` and thus do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the necessary state adjustments for the loop to execute are:

State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx1 <= idx2`; `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7])]`**

This ensures that `val` has at least one tuple, allowing the loop to execute.
