The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. No other variables are modified by this assignment. Since `i` is specified to be 5 in the initial state, `idx2` will also be 5 after the assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 5, `m` is an integer read from the input (and must be at least 3 if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`), `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `i` is 5, and `idx2` is 5. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
