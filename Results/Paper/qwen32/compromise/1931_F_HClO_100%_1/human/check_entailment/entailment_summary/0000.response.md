### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking the consistency of the given screenshots with a potential common order of participants. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and correctness considerations:

1. **Single Screenshot Case (`m == 1`)**:
   - If only one screenshot is provided, the program immediately returns "YES" because there's no contradiction possible with just one order.
   
2. **Multiple Screenshots Case (`m > 1`)**:
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and tries to reconcile them into a consistent order.
   - It removes the first element from both lists (which should be the author of the screenshot) and compares the remaining lists.
   - If the remaining lists are not identical, it concludes that the orders are inconsistent and returns "NO".
   - If they are identical, it looks for the point where the two lists differ when the first elements are included. This point helps in determining where the author of the second screenshot should be inserted in the first list to make them consistent.
   - If the lists can be made consistent by inserting the author of the second screenshot at the correct position, it continues to check the remaining screenshots against this reconstructed list.
   - If any subsequent screenshot does not match the reconstructed list (after removing the author), it returns "NO".
   - If all screenshots are consistent with the reconstructed list, it returns "YES".

### Correctness Considerations:

- **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the edge case where only one screenshot is provided.
- **Consistency Check**: The program effectively checks for consistency between the first two screenshots and uses this to reconstruct a potential common order.
- **Generalization**: After determining a potential common order from the first two screenshots, the program generalizes this to all other screenshots, ensuring that all provided orders can be reconciled into this common order.
- **Efficiency**: The program efficiently handles up to \(2 \times 10^5\) operations per test case, which is within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a consistent order of participants that matches all provided screenshots. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
