The code snippet provided increments the value of the variable `order` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num2`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `num2` must be greater than `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `order` is increased by 1.**
