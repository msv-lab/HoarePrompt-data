You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` composed of '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it checks the second last character of the second string and prints 'No' if it is '<', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The function does not modify the input values and outputs a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses, one for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The robot needs to move from cell (1, 1) to cell (2, n). The robot moves in two steps each second:
1. It can move left, right, down, or up (but not outside the grid).
2. It moves according to the arrow in the cell it ends up in after its move.

The key observation is that to reach (2, n) from (1, 1), the robot must eventually move down to row 2 and then move right to column n. The direction of the arrows in the grid must allow for such a path.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks only the second-to-last cell in the second row (cell (2, n-1)) for an arrow pointing left (`<`). If it finds an arrow pointing left, it outputs "No", otherwise, it outputs "Yes".

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Simplistic Check**: The program only checks one specific cell (2, n-1) for an arrow pointing left. This is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach (2, n) because the path to (2, n) depends on the entire grid configuration.
2. **Ignoring the First Row**: The program does not consider the arrows in the first row at all. The robot can move between rows, and the arrows in the first row can influence the robot's ability to reach (2, n).
3. **No Path Simulation**: The program does not simulate the robot's movement through the grid to verify if a valid path exists.

### Correctness:
Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach (2, n). It fails to consider the full complexity of the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
