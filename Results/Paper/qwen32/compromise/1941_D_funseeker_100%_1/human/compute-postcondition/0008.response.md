The code snippet provided adds a tuple to the set `temp`. The tuple contains the result of the expression `(q + r) % n`. Since `q` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume it is a variable that has a specific value in the context of the program. However, the specific value of `q` is not provided, so we will describe the output state in terms of `q`.

The variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` are not affected by the code snippet. The set `temp` now contains the tuple `(q + r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`.**
