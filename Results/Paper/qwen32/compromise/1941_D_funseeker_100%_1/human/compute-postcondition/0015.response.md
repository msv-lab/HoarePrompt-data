Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the values `x` and `y`, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0' or '?'. The set `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '?', `temp` also contains the value `(q - r) % n`.**
