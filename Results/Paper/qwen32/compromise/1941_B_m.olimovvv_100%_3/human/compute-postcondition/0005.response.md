The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. This output is not dependent on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The precondition describes the state of the program and the properties of the variables, but it does not influence the string that is printed.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`, which directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **NO**
