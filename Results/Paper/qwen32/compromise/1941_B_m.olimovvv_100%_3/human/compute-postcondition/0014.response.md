Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
