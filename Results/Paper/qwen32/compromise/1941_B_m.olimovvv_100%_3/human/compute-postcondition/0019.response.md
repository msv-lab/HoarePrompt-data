The given initial state describes a set of variables and operations that seem to be part of a loop or a specific algorithm, but the `print('NO')` statement is independent of these variables and operations. The `print('NO')` statement will simply output the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, or the value of `i`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
2. The variable `a` is an integer greater than 2.
3. The list `b` is being updated in a specific way: `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, and `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged.
4. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

However, none of these variables or operations affect the `print('NO')` statement. The `print('NO')` statement is straightforward and will output 'NO' as specified.

Output: **NO**
