The code snippet `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` modifies the value of `b[i + 2]` by subtracting the value of `b[i]` from it. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `a` is an integer greater than 2.
- `b[i]` is 0.
- `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`.
- `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

After executing the code snippet:
- `b[i + 2]` will be updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`. Since `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1.**
