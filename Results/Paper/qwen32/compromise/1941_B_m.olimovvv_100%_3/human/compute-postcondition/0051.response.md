To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the transformations applied to the list `b` during each iteration of the loop. Let's break down the process:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - The loop runs for `a - 2` iterations.
   - The loop checks if `b[-2] == 0` and `b[-1] == 0` at the end to determine if it should print 'YES' or 'NO'.

2. **Loop Iteration Details**:
   - For each iteration `i` in the range `0` to `a - 3`:
     - If `b[i] < 0`, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it modifies the list `b` as follows:
       - `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2`
       - `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`
       - `b[i] -= b[i]` (which effectively sets `b[i]` to 0)

3. **Output State after the Loop**:
   - After all iterations, the values in `b` are transformed based on the above rules.
   - The loop checks if `b[-2] == 0` and `b[-1] == 0`. If both are true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`, `b[2]` is `b[2] - b[0]`.
- After 2 iterations: `b[1]` is 0, `b[2]` is `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`, `b[3]` is `b[3] - b[1]`.
- After 3 iterations: `b[2]` is 0, `b[3]` is `b[3] - 2 * b[2]`, `b[4]` is `b[4] - b[2]`.

Continuing this pattern, after `a - 2` iterations, the first `a - 2` elements of `b` will be set to 0, and the remaining elements will be adjusted accordingly based on the previous elements.

**Final Output State**:
- The first `a - 2` elements of `b` are all 0.
- The remaining elements of `b` are adjusted based on the modifications during each iteration.
- The final check is whether `b[-2]` and `b[-1]` are 0.

If `b[-2]` and `b[-1]` are both 0 after all iterations, the output will be 'YES'; otherwise, it will be 'NO'.

Output State: **The first `a - 2` elements of `b` are 0, and the final output is 'YES' if `b[-2] == 0` and `b[-1] == 0`; otherwise, it is 'NO'.**
