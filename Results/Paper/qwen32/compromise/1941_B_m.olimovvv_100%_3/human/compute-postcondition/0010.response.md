The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` effectively sets `b[i]` to 0 because any number minus itself is 0. The other elements of the array `b`, specifically `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]`, are updated according to the given rules, but these updates are not affected by the change to `b[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`.**
