Reasoning:  
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. The main issue lies in the way the operations are applied and the conditions checked.

1. **Operation Application**: The code attempts to apply the operation by modifying the elements `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]` based on the value of `b[i]`. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem. The operation should be applied iteratively, and the choice of `i` should be based on the current state of the array, not just the value of `b[i]`.

2. **Condition Checking**: After the loop, the code checks if the last two elements `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are zero. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be made zero. The intermediate elements might not be zero, and the logic should ensure that all elements are zero after applying the operations.

3. **Negative Values**: The code checks if any element becomes negative during the process. However, the operation itself does not produce negative values; it only decreases the values. The check for negative values is unnecessary and does not correctly reflect the problem constraints.

4. **Logic for Operation**: The code does not correctly simulate the operation. The operation should be applied iteratively, and the choice of `i` should be based on the current state of the array. The code should aim to reduce the array elements to zero by choosing appropriate indices `i` where the operation can be applied.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**
