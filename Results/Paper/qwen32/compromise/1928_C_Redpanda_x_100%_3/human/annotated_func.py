#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` greater than 1 and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n`.

    #State: k is a non-negative integer, n is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, and x is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n. If k equals the length of the list primes, a value of 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, k is not equal to the length of the list primes; rest is an empty list; prime is the value of primes[k]; prime_to_i is prime * prime; factors[prime] is 0; and the loop has finished executing all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate` is a recursive generator that yields all possible products of the form \( p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{e_k} \), where \( p_i \) are prime numbers and \( e_i \) are non-negative integers up to a specified limit. The function takes a single parameter `k`, which indicates the current index in the list of primes, and it yields values based on the recursive generation of these products.
