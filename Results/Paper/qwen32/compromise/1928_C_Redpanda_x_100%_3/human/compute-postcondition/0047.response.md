The given code snippet is a `yield` statement which will return the current value of `factor` and pause the function's execution, saving its state. The initial state specifies that `factor` is the next value yielded by `generate(0)`. Since the `yield` statement returns `factor`, `factor` remains unchanged after the `yield` statement is executed.

Output State: **`factor` is the next value yielded by `generate(0)` and has been returned.**
