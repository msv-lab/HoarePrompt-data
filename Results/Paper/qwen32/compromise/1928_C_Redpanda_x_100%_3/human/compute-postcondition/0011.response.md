Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list primes; `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty list; `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`; `prime_to_i` is `prime`; `factors[prime]` is 0; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Explanation: The code snippet `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i` but does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid after this statement is executed.
