The code snippet `yield factor * prime_to_i` will produce a generator output but will not change the values of the variables `k`, `n`, `x`, `rest`, `prime`, `prime_to_i`, or `factors[prime]`. The `yield` statement will return the value `factor * prime_to_i` to the caller but will not modify the state of the variables within the function.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is an empty list, `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is `prime_to_i * prime`, `factors[prime]` is 0, and a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been returned.**
