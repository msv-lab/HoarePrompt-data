The code snippet `yield 1` does not affect the variables `k`, `n`, or `x`. It yields the value `1` and pauses the function, but it does not change the state of the variables provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, and `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n. Additionally, k equals the length of the list primes. A value of 1 has been yielded.**
