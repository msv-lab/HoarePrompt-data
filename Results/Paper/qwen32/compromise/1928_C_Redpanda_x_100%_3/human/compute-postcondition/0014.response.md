Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list primes; `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty list; `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`; `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`; `factors[prime]` is `factors[prime] + 1`; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

A value equal to `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded. The values of `k`, `n`, `x`, `rest`, `prime`, `prime_to_i`, and `factors[prime]` remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
