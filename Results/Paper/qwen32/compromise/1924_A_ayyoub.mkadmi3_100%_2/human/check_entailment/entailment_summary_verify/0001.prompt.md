You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
t = int(input())
OUT = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (b, s1, s2) = func_1(s, k, n)
    if not b:
        OUT.append('No')
        i = 97
        while i <= k + 97:
            if chr(i) not in s1:
                break
            i += 1
        be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))
        OUT.append(s2 + be9i)
    else:
        OUT.append('Yes')
for i in OUT:
    print(i)

def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
    r = len(s1) // k
    return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and returns a tuple. The tuple contains a boolean indicating if the length of `s` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s` starting from a specific index, and the last character of `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**: The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s`. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this. It seems to be attempting to track characters and their removal but does not properly check for all possible subsequences.

2. **Checking Subsequences**: The main issue is that the code does not actually generate and check all possible subsequences of length `n` against `s`. Instead, it attempts to build a simplified version of this check, which is insufficient.

3. **Generating Missing Subsequences**: When the function determines that not all subsequences are present, it tries to generate a missing subsequence but does so incorrectly. It simply finds the first character not in `s1` and repeats it, which does not guarantee that this will be a missing subsequence.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle several edge cases, such as when `n` is large relative to `k`, or when `s` contains repeated characters in a way that makes certain subsequences impossible.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the failure of the program:

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
3 2 6
aababb
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
aaa
```

**Explanation of Counterexample:**
- All possible strings of length 3 using 'a' and 'b' are: aaa, aab, aba, abb, baa, bab, bba, bbb.
- The string "aababb" does not contain "aaa", "aba", "abb", "bab", "bba", or "bbb" as subsequences.
- The program should output "NO" followed by any of these missing subsequences, such as "aaa".

However, the provided program might incorrectly output "YES" or an incorrect subsequence because it does not properly check for all possible subsequences.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and fails to meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.
