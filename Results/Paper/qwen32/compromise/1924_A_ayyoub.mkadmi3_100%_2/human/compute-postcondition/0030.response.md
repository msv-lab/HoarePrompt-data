Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` and `n`. It returns a tuple containing three elements: (1) a boolean indicating whether the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, (2) a substring of `s` starting from index `r * k` to the end, where `r` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement but can be inferred as the quotient of integer division of the length of `s` by `k`, and (3) the last character of `s`.**
