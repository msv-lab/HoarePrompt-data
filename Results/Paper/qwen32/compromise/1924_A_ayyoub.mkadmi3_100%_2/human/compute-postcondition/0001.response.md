The given code snippet initializes a new variable `s2` as an empty string. This does not affect the existing variables `s`, `k`, `n`, `m`, or `s1`. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, the length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000, and `s1` is an empty string; `s2` is an empty string.**
