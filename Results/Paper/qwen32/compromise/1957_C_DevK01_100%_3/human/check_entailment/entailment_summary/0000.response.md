### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves in a game involving white and black rooks. The key aspects of the problem are:

1. **Game Rules:**
   - Players take turns placing rooks on an n x n chessboard.
   - A rook can only be placed in a position that is not attacked by any other rook (i.e., no two rooks in the same row or column).
   - The player places a white rook, and the computer mirrors the move by placing a black rook at the mirrored position (r, c) -> (c, r).
   - If r = c, the computer skips its turn.
   - The game continues until no more valid moves are possible.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations modulo 10^9 + 7.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each valid move reduces the number of available positions for future moves.
   - If a rook is placed at (r, c) with r != c, both row r and column c (and also row c and column r) are no longer available, reducing the effective size of the board by 2.
   - If a rook is placed at (r, r), only row r and column r are no longer available, reducing the effective size of the board by 1.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then processes the `k` moves, updating the size of the board `n` based on whether the move was on the diagonal (r == c) or not.
   - The function `func_1(n)` computes the number of possible configurations for the remaining board size `n` using dynamic programming.

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` initializes a dynamic programming table `dp` with base cases `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`.
   - It then iteratively computes `dp[i]` for `i` from 2 to `n` using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the combinatorial nature of placing non-attacking rooks on a board, considering the recursive structure of the problem.

5. **Execution Summary:**
   - The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the number of configurations for a given `n` using the specified recursive formula modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after the given moves, taking into account the rules of the game and using dynamic programming to efficiently compute the result. The execution summary supports this conclusion.

**Correctness: True**
