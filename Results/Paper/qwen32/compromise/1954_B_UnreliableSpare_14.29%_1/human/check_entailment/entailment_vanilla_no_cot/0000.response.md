Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Here are the issues:

1. The program incorrectly uses `Decimal('Infinity')` to initialize `ans`. While this is not incorrect, it is unnecessary and can be replaced with a large integer or `float('inf')`.

2. The program checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same) and prints `-1` if true. This part is correct.

3. However, the logic for calculating `ans` (the minimum number of elements to remove) is flawed. The program only considers the longest contiguous subsequence starting from the first element and does not correctly find the minimum number of elements to remove in all cases.

4. The program does not consider cases where the minimum number of elements to remove might involve breaking the pattern in other parts of the array.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible segments of the array to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to disrupt the "beautiful" property. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_beautiful(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr) - 1):
        if arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1] and arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            return True
    return False

def min_removals_to_break_beauty(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if len(set(arr)) == 1:
        return -1
    
    min_removals = n
    for i in range(n):
        new_arr = arr[:i] + arr[i+1:]
        if not is_beautiful(new_arr):
            min_removals = min(min_removals, 1)
            break
    
    # Try removing more than one element if necessary
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            new_arr = arr[:i] + arr[i+1:j] + arr[j+1:]
            if not is_beautiful(new_arr):
                min_removals = min(min_removals, 2)
                break
        else:
            continue
        break
    
    # If no removal of 1 or 2 elements works, we need to remove more
    if min_removals == n:
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                for k in range(j+1, n):
                    new_arr = arr[:i] + arr[i+1:j] + arr[j+1:k] + arr[k+1:]
                    if not is_beautiful(new_arr):
                        min_removals = min(min_removals, 3)
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            else:
                continue
            break
    
    return min_removals

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min_removals_to_break_beauty(arr))
```

This version of the program correctly checks different scenarios for removing elements to break the beautiful property of the array.
