Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the code and provide a counterexample.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is intended to store the minimum length of a contiguous segment of identical elements. However, the current implementation does not correctly identify and handle all such segments.
   - The code initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and updates it with the length of segments of identical elements. However, it fails to correctly identify when a segment ends and a new one begins.

2. **Handling of Identical Elements:**
   - The code checks if all elements are identical at the beginning and returns `-1` if they are. This part is correct.
   - However, the logic for calculating the minimum segment length is flawed. The code does not correctly identify all segments of identical elements and does not handle cases where multiple segments of different lengths coexist.

### Counterexample:

Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
7
1 2 2 1 2 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The array `[1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]` is beautiful.
- To make it stop being beautiful, we can remove two elements, for example, the two middle `2`s, resulting in `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
1
```

The program incorrectly outputs `1` for this case, indicating that it does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle cases where multiple segments of identical elements exist and does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
