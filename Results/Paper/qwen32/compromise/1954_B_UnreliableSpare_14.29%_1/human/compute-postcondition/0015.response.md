The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters as per the provided function definition. However, based on the context, it is implied that it processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function likely computes and returns some result based on the properties of the list `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It computes and returns a result based on the properties of the list `a`, which is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition.**
