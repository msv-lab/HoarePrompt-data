The `print(-1)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables (`ans`, `val`, `cnt`, `flag`, or `arr`) as described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Let's break down the context provided:

- `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. However, the value of `ans` is not used in the `print` statement.
- `val` remains `arr[0]`. Again, the value of `val` is not used in the `print` statement.
- `cnt` remains unchanged. The value of `cnt` is not used in the `print` statement.
- `flag` is true. The value of `flag` is not used in the `print` statement.
- `arr` is a list, but its specific contents are not relevant to the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is `print(-1)`, it will output the integer `-1`, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **-1**
