arr is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer in each inner list is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), representing the number of piles in the game. The next n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represent the initial number of stones in each of the n piles. The total number of piles across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
