Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
    
    1
    
    1000000000

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

# Program:
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
c = 1
while t > 0:
    n = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    r = func_1(arr)
    print(r)
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    if arr[0] != 1:
        return 'Alice'
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        A = not A
    if not_c:
        A = not A
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer `n` (number of piles) followed by `n` integers (initial number of stones in each pile). The function returns 'Alice' if the first element `t` is not equal to 1, or if a specific condition based on the uniqueness and consecutive differences of elements in the test case is met. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.
