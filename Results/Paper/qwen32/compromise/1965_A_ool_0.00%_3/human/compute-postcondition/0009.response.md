Postcondition: **`A` will be either `True` or `False` depending on the number of times it was toggled. `not_c` is `True`, indicating that all differences between consecutive elements in `set_` are â‰¤ 1. The values of `arr`, `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. The loop has not encountered any differences greater than 1, so it continues to execute.**
