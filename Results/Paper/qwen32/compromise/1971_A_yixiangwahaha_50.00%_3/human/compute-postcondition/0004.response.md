To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `x` and `y` based on the input provided in each iteration.

The loop runs 10 times, and in each iteration, it:
1. Takes a string input, splits it into two parts, and converts them to integers.
2. Appends the first integer to the list `x`.
3. Appends the second integer to the list `y`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact input values, we can describe the output state in a general form. After 10 iterations, `x` and `y` will each contain 10 integers, which are the first and second integers from each of the 10 input strings, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input integer, `x` is a list of 10 integers, `y` is a list of 10 integers.**
