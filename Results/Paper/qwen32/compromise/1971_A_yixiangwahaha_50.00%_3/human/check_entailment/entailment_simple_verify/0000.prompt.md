You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: `t` is a string representing the input integer, `x` is a list of 10 integers, `y` is a list of 10 integers.
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: `t` is a string representing the input integer, `x` is a list of 10 integers, `y` is a list of 10 integers.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the number of test cases specified by the input `t`. The program assumes there will always be exactly 10 test cases, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The problem description states that the number of test cases can be between 1 and 100, inclusive. Therefore, the program should use the value of `t` to determine the number of iterations for reading the test cases and processing them.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
t = input()
x = []
y = []
for i in range(10):  # This should be range(int(t)) to handle the actual number of test cases
    xylist = input().split(' ')
    x.append(int(xylist[0]))
    y.append(int(xylist[1]))
for i in range(10):  # This should also be range(int(t))
    if x[i] < y[i]:
        print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
    else:
        print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
```

To fix this, the code should be modified to use `int(t)` in the range functions:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Convert t to an integer
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(t):  # Use t to determine the number of test cases
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(t):  # Use t to determine the number of test cases
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], y[i])  # Removed unnecessary space
        else:
            print(y[i], x[i])  # Removed unnecessary space
```

With these changes, the program will correctly handle any number of test cases between 1 and 100, inclusive.
