The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `root`. The loop will execute if `root` is at least 2, because the range function `range(2, root + 1)` requires `root + 1` to be greater than 2 for the loop to start. This means `root` must be at least 2.

Let's break it down:

- `i` is the loop variable and it starts at 2, so we don't need to adjust its initial state before the loop starts.
- `root` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and for the loop to execute, `root` must be at least 2.

Given that `root` is calculated based on `n`, we need to ensure that `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is at least 2. This implies that `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 1. However, since the problem states `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^6`, `n` already satisfies this condition.

Thus, we only need to ensure that `root` is at least 2, which is already guaranteed by the problem constraints on `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^6; `ans` is equal to `n`; `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` and must be at least 2**
