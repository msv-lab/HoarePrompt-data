To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, we need to understand the effect of the loop on the variable `ans`. The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = root` (inclusive), where `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. In each iteration, the variable `cnt` is set to `i * i`, and `ans` is incremented by `(n + i) // cnt`.

Let's break down the loop's effect:

1. The loop starts with `i = 2` and goes up to `root`.
2. For each `i`, `cnt` is calculated as `i * i`.
3. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to it.

The final value of `ans` after the loop is the sum of the initial value of `ans` (which is `n`) and the sum of `(n + i) // cnt` for all `i` from `2` to `root`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` (the number of test cases) remains unchanged.
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is initially `n` and is updated by the loop.
- `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` and remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^6; `ans` is the result of `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2)); `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.**
