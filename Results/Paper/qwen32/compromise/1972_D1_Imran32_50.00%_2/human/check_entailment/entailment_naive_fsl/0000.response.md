Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem described. The code appears to be attempting to solve a different problem or has a logical error in the implementation.

The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the given code does not properly address these conditions. Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. The function `func_1()` is incorrectly named and does not take the parameters `n` and `m` correctly.
2. The variable `k` is used instead of `m` in the input parsing.
3. The logic inside the loop does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To demonstrate the incorrectness, let's consider a simple test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
- \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\)
- \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\)
- \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\)

The provided code does not produce the correct output for this test case or any other test cases that I can think of. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Incorrect Output for the Test Case:**
The code will not produce the correct output for the given test case, indicating that the logic is flawed.
