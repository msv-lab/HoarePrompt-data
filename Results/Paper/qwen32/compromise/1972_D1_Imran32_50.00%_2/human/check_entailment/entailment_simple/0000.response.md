### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve a problem where we need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve this problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Function Call and Parameters**:
   - The main loop calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the line `n, k = map(int, input().split())` suggests that the function is expecting two parameters \(n\) and \(k\). However, the problem description specifies \(n\) and \(m\), not \(n\) and \(k\).

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` is unrelated to the problem. It calculates a value `ans` based on some mathematical operations involving `n` and `i` but does not consider `m` or the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The formula used in the loop `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not address the problem's requirement.

3. **Lack of \(m\) Consideration**:
   - The program does not iterate over possible values of \(b\) (which should be up to \(m\)) and does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program is clearly incorrect as it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
