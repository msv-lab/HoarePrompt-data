The code `o = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `o`. The values of `i`, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is the value of `input()`, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in `a` to integers, `o` is a list of substrings from the new input line.**
