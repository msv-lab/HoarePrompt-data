Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is the value of `input()`, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in `a` to integers, `o` is a list of substrings from the new input line, `n` is the first element of `b`, `f` is the second element of `b`, `k` is the third element of `b`, `fav` is `o[f - 1]`. If `k` is equal to `n`, the state of the variables remains as described. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.**

In simple terms: The variable `fav` is assigned the value of the substring at index `f - 1` from the list `o`. All other variables remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
