Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **i**: Set to 2.
2. **l**: A list of unique elements from `o` sorted in descending order and must have at least one element.
3. **t**: Remains unchanged (its value is not provided, but it doesn't affect the `print` statement).
4. **a**: The value of `input()`, which means it will be whatever the user inputs.
5. **b**: A list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in `a` to integers.
6. **o**: A list of substrings from the new input line sorted in descending order.
7. **n**: The first element of `b`.
8. **f**: The second element of `b`.
9. **k**: The third element of `b` minus the count of `l[0]` in `o` minus the count of `l[1]` in `o` minus the count of `l[2]` in `o`.
10. **dic**: A dictionary with keys as elements from `o` and values as their respective counts in `o`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```
This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. 

### Variables and Their Values:
- The value of `a`, `b`, `o`, `l`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `dic` all depend on the user input and the sorting and processing of that input, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- The variable `t` is mentioned but not used.
- The variable `i` is set to 2 but not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or the user input, the output will be the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
