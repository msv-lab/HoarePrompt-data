The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, and `k` are described in the initial state, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values are irrelevant to the output of this specific `print` statement.

The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
