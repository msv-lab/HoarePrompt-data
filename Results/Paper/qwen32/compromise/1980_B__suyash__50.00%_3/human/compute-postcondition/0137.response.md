Postcondition: **`i` is `len(l)`, `t` is greater than `len(l)`, `a` is the value of the new `input()`, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the previous `a` to integers, `o` is a list of substrings from the new input line sorted in descending order, `n` is the first element of `b`, `f` is the second element of `b`, `dic` is a dictionary with keys as elements from `o` and values as their respective counts in `o`, `l` is a list of unique elements from `o` sorted in descending order, `k` is the third element of `b`, `fav` is `o[f - 1]`. If the index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1`, the program continues with these conditions. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.**
