Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `f` and `k` are additional integers, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
