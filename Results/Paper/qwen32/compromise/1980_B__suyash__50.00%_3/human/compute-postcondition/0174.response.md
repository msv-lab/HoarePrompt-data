To determine what will be printed by the `print('MAYBE')` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the given Python code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`i`**: `i` is set to `len(l) - 1`, which means it points to the last index of the list `l`.
2. **`t`**: `t` is greater than `len(l)`, but its exact value is not relevant to the `print` statement.
3. **`a`**: `a` is the value of a new input, which is a string.
4. **`b`**: `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting space-separated values from the string `a` to integers.
5. **`o`**: `o` is a list of substrings from a new input line, sorted in descending order, and must have at least one substring.
6. **`n`**: `n` is the first element of `b`.
7. **`f`**: `f` is the second element of `b`.
8. **`dic`**: `dic` is a dictionary with keys as elements from `o` and values as their respective counts in `o`.
9. **`l`**: `l` is a list of unique elements from `o`, sorted in descending order.
10. **`fav`**: `fav` is `o[f - 1]`, which means it is the `f`-th element from the list `o` (1-based index).
11. **`k`**: The value of `k` depends on the condition `if fav != l[i]`:
    - If `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`, `k` is calculated as `b[2] - 2 * dic[l[len(l)]] - dic[l[i]]`.
    - If `fav` is equal to `l[i]`, `k` is calculated as `b[2] - 2 * dic[l[len(l)]] - dic[l[i]] - dic[l[i]]`.
    - In both cases, if `k` is less than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. However, this does not affect the `print('MAYBE')` statement directly.

### Code Execution:
The `print('MAYBE')` statement is executed regardless of the values of `k` and the conditions related to it. It simply prints the string "MAYBE".

### Conclusion:
The `print('MAYBE')` statement will output the string "MAYBE" without any conditions or dependencies on the values of `k` or any other variables.

Output: **MAYBE**
