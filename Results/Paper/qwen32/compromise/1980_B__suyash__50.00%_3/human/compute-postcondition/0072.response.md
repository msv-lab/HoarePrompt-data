The code assigns the value of `o[f - 1]` to a new variable `fav`. The variables `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged unless `k` is equal to `n`, which does not affect the assignment of `fav`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is the value of `input()`, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in `a` to integers, `o` is a list of substrings from the new input line, `n` is the first element of `b`, `f` is the second element of `b`, `k` is the third element of `b`. If `k` is equal to `n`, the state of the variables remains as described. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. `fav` is `o[f - 1]`.**
