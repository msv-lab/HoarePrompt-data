To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and is at least 2.
- `j` is calculated as `n // 2 - 1`.
- `k` is initially not defined in the problem statement, but it is mentioned that `k` is `k + 1`. This suggests that `k` is being incremented in a loop or some iterative process, but its initial value is not provided. For the sake of this explanation, we will assume `k` starts at 0 (common in loops).
- `count` is incremented by 1 if `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]`. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(count * 2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `count`**: The problem states that `count` is incremented or reset based on certain conditions. However, the initial value of `count` is not specified. For the purpose of this explanation, we'll consider the worst-case scenario where `count` could be any value based on the conditions provided.
2. **Conditions for `count`**:
   - If `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]`, `count` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.
3. **The Print Statement**:
   - The print statement will output `count * 2`.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, the value of `count` depends on the characters in the list `s` and the value of `k`. Since we don't have the specific list `s` and the exact value of `k`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `count`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `count`.

Output: **count * 2 (where count is incremented by 1 if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j], otherwise count is set to 0)**
