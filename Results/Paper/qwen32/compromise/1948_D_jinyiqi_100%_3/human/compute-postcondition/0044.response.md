Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 1. If `s[k]` is a question mark or `s[k + j]` is a question mark or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0.**
