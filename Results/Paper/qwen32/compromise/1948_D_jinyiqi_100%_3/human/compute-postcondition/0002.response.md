The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and the range parameters. The loop will execute if the range `(n // 2, 0, -1)` generates at least one value. This means `n // 2` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Let's break it down:
- `j` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and determines the range of the loop.
- The range `(n // 2, 0, -1)` will generate values if `n // 2` is greater than 0.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 2 (since `n // 2` must be greater than 0).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2**
