The code snippet `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a list of characters for each of the `t` test cases, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The total length of all lists `s` across all test cases does not exceed 5000. The value of `t` and the specific contents of `s` are not changed by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a list of characters, where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark; `n` is the length of the list `s`.**
