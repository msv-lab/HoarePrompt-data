### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring after replacing question marks with lowercase Latin letters. The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it processes a string `s` to determine the maximum length of a tandem repeat.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The string `s` is converted into a list of characters.
   - The program iterates over possible lengths of the first half of a tandem repeat, starting from `n // 2` (half the length of the string) down to `1`.
   - For each possible length `j`, it checks all possible starting positions `k` of the first half of the tandem repeat.
   - For each position `k`, it checks if the characters at positions `k` and `k + j` are either identical or one of them is a question mark. If so, it increments a `count`.
   - If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, and the program prints `2 * j` and exits the function for that test case.

3. **Handling No Tandem Repeat:**
   - If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, the program prints `0`.

### Correctness Analysis:

The program's logic is correct in terms of identifying the longest possible tandem repeat substring after replacing question marks. The approach of checking possible lengths of the first half of a tandem repeat and verifying the conditions is sound.

However, there is a critical issue in the program: the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code snippet. The function call `func_1()` in the main loop will result in a `NameError` because `func_1()` is not defined anywhere in the code.

To make the program correct, the function `func_1()` should be properly defined and included in the code snippet. The provided `func_1()` definition seems to be the correct implementation of the logic, but it needs to be properly integrated into the program.

### Conclusion:

The logic of `func_1()` is correct, but the program is incomplete due to the missing function definition. Therefore, the program as given is not executable and thus not correct in its current form.

**Correctness: False**
