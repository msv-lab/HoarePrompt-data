Output State: **`nabors` is `nabors + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers read from input, `bb` is a list of integers read from input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `cnt_aa` after removing the counts that are in `D`.**

In simpler terms, `E` now holds the counts of integers from `cnt_aa` that are not present in `D`, which is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. All other variables retain their initial state values.
