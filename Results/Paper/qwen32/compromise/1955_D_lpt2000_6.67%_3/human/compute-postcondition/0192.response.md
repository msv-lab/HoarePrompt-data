Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers and two integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it calculates how many times a sliding window of size `m` over the first list has at least `k` common elements with the second list. It prints the count of such occurrences for each test case.**
