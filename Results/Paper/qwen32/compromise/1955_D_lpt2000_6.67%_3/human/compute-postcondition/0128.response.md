The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state of `nabors` is `nabors + 1`, which means it has already been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Output State: **`nabors` is `nabors + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

This output state reflects that the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` have been set to the integers provided in the input, and `nabors` retains its incremented value.
