Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6. `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^6. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `nabors` is an integer read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                C[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                D[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        tot = sum(D.values())
        fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, `aa` is a list of integers read from the input with at least `n` elements, `bb` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` after all iterations, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` after all iterations, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` after all iterations, `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D` after the final iteration, `fnd` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nabors` is `nabors - (n - m_initial)`, `m` is `n - 1`, `cnt_aa` counts occurrences of all elements in `aa`, `D`, `E`, and `C` are updated based on the final `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `tot` is the sum of the values in the final `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nabors` is `nabors + (n - m)`, `D` is the final intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` after all iterations, `E` is the final state of `cnt_aa` after removing the counts that are in `D`, `C` is the final state of `cnt_bb` after removing the counts that are in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, and `fnd` is `1 + (number_of_iterations_where_tot_ge_k)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
