Postcondition: **`n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` is `m + 1`, `nabors` is `nabors - 1`, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `aa` is a new list of integers read from the input, `bb` is a new list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m + 1]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with the count of `out_aa` decreased by 1, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` with the count of `out_aa` decremented by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise unchanged, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` with the count of `out_aa` increased by 1 if `E[out_aa] <= 0`, otherwise unchanged, `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D` after the final iteration, and `fnd` is 2 if `tot >= k`, otherwise `fnd` is 1.**
