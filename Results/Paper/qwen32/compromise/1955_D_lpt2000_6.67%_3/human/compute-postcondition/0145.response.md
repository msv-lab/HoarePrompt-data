Postcondition: **`nabors` is `nabors + 1`, `n` is an input integer such that `n >= m`, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers read from input with at least `max(m, n - m)` elements, `bb` is a list of integers read from input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with `D[out_aa]` decremented by 1, `E` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `cnt_aa` after removing the counts that are in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `cnt_bb` after removing the counts that are in `D` and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was 0, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D` minus 1, `fnd` is `1` if `tot >= k` else `0`, and `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0 or equal to 0 if it was 1. Additionally, `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0 if the if condition was true, otherwise `E[out_aa]` is 0.**
