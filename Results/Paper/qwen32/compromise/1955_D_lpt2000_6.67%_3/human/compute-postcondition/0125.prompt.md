Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is `nabors - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `aa` is a new list of integers read from the input, `bb` is a new list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` after the operation, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` after the operation, `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D` after the final iteration, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is less than the length of `aa`, `nabors` is `nabors - 1`, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `aa` is a new list of integers read from the input, `bb` is a new list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` after the operation, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` after the operation, `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D` after the final iteration, and `fnd` is 2 if `tot >= k`, otherwise `fnd` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` is `m + 1`, `nabors` is `nabors - 1`, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `aa` is a new list of integers read from the input, `bb` is a new list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m + 1]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`, `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D`, `fnd` is 3 if `tot >= k`, otherwise `fnd` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than `m + 2`; `m` is `m + 2`; `nabors` is `nabors - 1`; `k` is the third integer read from the input; `aa` is a new list of integers read from the input; `bb` is a new list of integers read from the input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m + 2]`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`; `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D` (recalculated); `fnd` is 4 if `tot >= k`, otherwise `fnd` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
