Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is equal to the number of iterations, `num` is `i` if `i` is not in `no`, otherwise `num` remains 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `big` is a list containing at least one element (e.g., `[1]`), `less` is a list containing at least one element with a value greater than the maximum value in `big` (e.g., `[2]`), and `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2. If `i` is not in `no`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
