Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. For each test case, it finds and prints the smallest integer `k` that satisfies all the given constraints. The constraints can require `k` to be greater than or equal to a value, less than or equal to a value, or not equal to a value.**
