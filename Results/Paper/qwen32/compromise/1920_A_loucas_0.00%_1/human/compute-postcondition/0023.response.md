Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `iterable2` is `iterable2 + 1`. If `x` is 1, `less` is an empty list, `big` contains the value of `a`, and `no` contains `[a]`. If `x` is 2, `less` contains the value of `a`, and both `big` and `no` contain `[a]`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, and `no` contains `[a, a]`.**
