Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from input, `a` is the second integer from input. If `x` is 1, `less` is an empty list, `big` contains the value of `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` contains the value of `a`, and both `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, both `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` contains the value of `a`.**
