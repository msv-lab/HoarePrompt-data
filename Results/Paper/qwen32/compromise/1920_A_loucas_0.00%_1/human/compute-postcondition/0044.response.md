Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is equal to the number of iterations, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `big` is a list containing at least one element (e.g., `[1]`), `less` is a list containing at least one element with a value greater than the maximum value in `big` (e.g., `[2, 3]`), and `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2. `i` is `max(big) + 1`, `num` is `max(big) + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
