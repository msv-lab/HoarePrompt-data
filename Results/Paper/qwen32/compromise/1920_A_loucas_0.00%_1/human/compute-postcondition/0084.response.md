Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 1`, `big` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 1, `less` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 2, and `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2`, with the condition that `max(big) < min(less)`. If `i` is not an element of `no`, then `num` is set to `i` and the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is an element of `no`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
