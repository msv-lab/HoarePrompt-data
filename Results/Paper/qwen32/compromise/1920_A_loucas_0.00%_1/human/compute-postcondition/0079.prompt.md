Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is equal to the previous value of `innerLoop`, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list, `iterable` is the previous value of `innerLoop + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is equal to the previous value of `innerLoop`, `iterable` is the previous value of `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is 0, `iterable` is the previous value of `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` twice, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is 1, `iterable` is the previous value of `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` three times, and `less` and `no` are lists containing the value of `a` once. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` twice, and `big` and `no` are lists containing the value of `a` once. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` twice, and `big` and `less` are lists containing the value of `a` once.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
