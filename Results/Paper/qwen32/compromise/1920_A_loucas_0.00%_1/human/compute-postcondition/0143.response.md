Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` lines of constraints. Each constraint is defined by two integers `a` and `x`, where `a` indicates the type of constraint (1 for `k >= x`, 2 for `k <= x`, and 3 for `k != x`). The function returns the smallest integer `k` that satisfies all the constraints for each test case.**
