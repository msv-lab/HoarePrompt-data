The code snippet assigns two integer values to the variables `x` and `a` by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer. The initial state of all other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`loop` must be greater than 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from input, `a` is the second integer from input.**
