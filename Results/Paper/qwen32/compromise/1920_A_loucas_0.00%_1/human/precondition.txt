t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. constraints is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. Each test case starts with an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, followed by n pairs of integers (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. a denotes the type of constraint: if a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x; if a=2, k must be less than or equal to x; if a=3, k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case.
