The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided, and the constraints on `t` remain valid. The variables `n` and `k` and their constraints are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676.**
