Let's break down the given information and determine the output step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676.
- `n` is an integer provided by the input.
- `k` is an integer provided by the input and is equal to 1.
- `s` is a string of `k` consecutive lowercase letters starting from 'a'. Since `k` is 1, `s` is simply "a".

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(n * s)
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Understanding `n * s`:**
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `s` is the string "a".
   - In Python, multiplying a string by an integer `n` results in the string being repeated `n` times. For example, `"a" * 3` results in `"aaa"`.

2. **Output Determination:**
   - The expression `n * s` will produce a string consisting of the character 'a' repeated `n` times.
   - Therefore, the output will be a string of 'a' characters, with the length of the string equal to the value of `n`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **a repeated n times (where n is the provided integer input)**
