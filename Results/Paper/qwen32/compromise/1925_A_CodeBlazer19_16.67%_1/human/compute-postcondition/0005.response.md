The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Given that `s` is initially an empty string, after this operation, `s` will contain exactly one character, which is `chr(j)`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676; `n` is an integer provided by the input; `k` must be at least 0; `s` is a string containing the character `chr(j)`**.
