The code snippet provided initializes an empty string variable `s`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `t`, `n`, and `k`, except that `s` is now an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `s` is an empty string**.
