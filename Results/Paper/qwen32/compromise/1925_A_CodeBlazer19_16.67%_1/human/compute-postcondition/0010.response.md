To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it modifies the variables.

The loop iterates over a range starting from 97 up to `k + 97`. In each iteration, it appends the ASCII character corresponding to the current value of `j` to the string `s`.

Here's a breakdown of the loop:

- The loop variable `j` starts at 97 (which is the ASCII value for 'a').
- The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `k + 97`.
- In each iteration, `s` is updated by appending the character represented by `chr(j)`.

The final value of `s` will be a string of consecutive lowercase letters starting from 'a', up to the letter represented by the ASCII value of `k + 96`.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, after the loop finishes all its iterations, the output state will be:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `k` remains unchanged as it defines the range of the loop.
- `s` will be a string of `k` consecutive lowercase letters starting from 'a'.

For example, if `k` is 3, `s` will be "abc". If `k` is 5, `s` will be "abcde".

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676; `n` is an integer provided by the input; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `s` is a string of `k` consecutive lowercase letters starting from 'a'.**
