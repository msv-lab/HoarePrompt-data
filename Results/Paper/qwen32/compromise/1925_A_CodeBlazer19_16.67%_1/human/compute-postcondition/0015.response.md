Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676; `n` is an integer provided by the input; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `s` is a string of `k` consecutive lowercase letters starting from 'a'. If `k` is equal to 1, then `s` is "a". Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 1, and `s` is a string of `k` consecutive lowercase letters starting from 'a'.**
