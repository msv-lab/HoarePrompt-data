The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `t` must be greater than 4.

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, `n` is the first integer provided by the input, `k` is the second integer provided by the input, `s` is a string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, and `i` is 5**
