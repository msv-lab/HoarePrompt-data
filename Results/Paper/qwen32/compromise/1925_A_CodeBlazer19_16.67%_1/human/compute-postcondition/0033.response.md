The code snippet `s = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `s`, overwriting its previous value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `s` is an empty string, and `i` is 5.**
