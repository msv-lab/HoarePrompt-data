### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided program, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We begin with a fully connected graph of \( n \) islands, meaning there are \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) bridges.
- Dominater can destroy at most \( k \) bridges.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit starting from island 1.

#### Key Observations:
1. If \( k = 0 \), no bridges are destroyed, and Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.
2. If Dominater can destroy enough bridges to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, Everule can only visit island 1. This happens when \( k \ge n-1 \).
3. If \( 0 < k < n-1 \), Dominater cannot completely disconnect island 1 from all other islands, but can disconnect it from some of them. However, as long as \( k < n-1 \), there will still be a path from island 1 to some other islands.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program logic is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```
Let's break down the logic:
- The condition `n - k <= 1` is equivalent to `k >= n-1`.
  - If `k >= n-1`, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can only visit island 1.
  - If `k < n-1`, Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.

The logic in the program correctly captures the above observations:
- When \( k \ge n-1 \) (i.e., `n - k <= 1`), the output is 1, meaning Everule can only visit island 1.
- When \( k < n-1 \) (i.e., `n - k > 1`), the output is \( n \), meaning Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm the state of the program:
- For each test case, the output will be \( n \) if \( n - k \le 1 \); otherwise, the output will be 1.
- This aligns with the correct logic derived from the problem analysis.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
