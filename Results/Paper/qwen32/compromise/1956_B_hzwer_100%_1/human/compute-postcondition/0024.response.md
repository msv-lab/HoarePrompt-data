The code snippet resets the `cnt` list to a new list of `n + 1` zeros, where `n` is the integer value of `t`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the integer value of `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.**
