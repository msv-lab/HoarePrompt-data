Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. Each integer in the list `a` is between 1 and `n` and appears at most twice. The function returns the count of integers that appear exactly once in the list `a` for each test case.**
