The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. 

Given the initial state, `n` is already defined as the integer value of `t`. Therefore, executing this line of code will not change the value of `n` since it is already set to the integer value of `t`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the integer value of `t`; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers; `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.**
