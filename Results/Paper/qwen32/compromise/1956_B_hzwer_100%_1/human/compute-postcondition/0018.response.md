The code snippet `ans += max(0, x - 1)` updates the value of `ans` by adding `max(0, x - 1)` to its current value. Here's the breakdown:

- `x` is the next element in the list `cnt`.
- `ans` is initially defined as `max(0, x - 1)` plus its previous value.

After executing the line, `ans` will be updated to include the additional `max(0, x - 1)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the integer value of `t`; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers; `x` is the next element in `cnt`; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and `max(0, x - 1)`.**
