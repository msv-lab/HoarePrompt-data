Reasoning:

The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Selection of Elements Based on Commands**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to select elements from the array `a` based on the commands in `s`. If the command is 'L', it should select the leftmost element and remove it. If the command is 'R', it should select the rightmost element and remove it.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not actually remove elements from `a` after processing each command. Instead, it creates a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands but does not modify `a` in place. This means that the product calculation is incorrect because it does not reflect the state of `a` after each removal.

2. **Incorrect Product Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order and appends these products to `ans`. However, this does not correspond to the product of the current state of `a` after each command.
   - The product should be calculated based on the remaining elements of `a` after each command is processed, not on a list `b` that is constructed independently of the command processing.

3. **Ignoring the Modulo Operation**:
   - The problem statement requires taking the remainder of the product when divided by `m` after each command. However, the provided code does not perform this modulo operation during the product calculation.

4. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The final output should be the remainders of the products of the current state of `a` after each command. The provided code does not produce this output correctly due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
