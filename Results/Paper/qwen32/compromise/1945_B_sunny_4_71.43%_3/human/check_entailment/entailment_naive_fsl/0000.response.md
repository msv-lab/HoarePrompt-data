Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program simply calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m` and sums them up. However, this approach does not account for the overlap in visibility times of fireworks from both installations.

For example, consider the input `a = 2`, `b = 2`, and `m = 4`. According to the problem statement, fireworks from both installations will overlap in visibility. The fireworks launched at times 0, 2, and 4 from both installations will be visible in the sky at the same time. Thus, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously should be 5 (3 from the first installation and 3 from the second installation, minus the overlap at times 0, 2, and 4, which are counted twice).

However, the given program will output `6` (3 + 3) for this input, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and then account for the overlaps using the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        A = (m // a) + 1
        B = (m // b) + 1
        LCM = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        AB = (m // LCM) + 1
        print(A + B - AB)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation and subtracts the overlaps to get the correct maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
