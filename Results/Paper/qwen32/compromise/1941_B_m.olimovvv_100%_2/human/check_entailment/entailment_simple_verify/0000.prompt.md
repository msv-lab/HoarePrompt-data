You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_j satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
    #State: A sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' for each test case, with at least the third test case resulting in 'YES'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Loop and Indexing**:
   - The loop `for i in range(0, a - 2):` is incorrect because it should start from index 1 (second element) and go up to `a - 2` (second last element) as per the problem description.
   - The operation `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` are incorrect because they do not follow the described operation. Instead, they should be `b[i - 1] -= 1`, `b[i] -= 2`, and `b[i + 1] -= 1`.

2. **Incorrect Termination Condition**:
   - The condition `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:` is not sufficient to determine if all elements can be zero. It only checks the last two elements, but the operation can affect any elements in the array.

3. **Negative Values**:
   - The check `if b[i] < 0:` is incorrect because the problem does not specify that elements can become negative. The operation should ensure that no negative values are introduced, but the logic should focus on making all elements zero.

4. **Logic to Make Elements Zero**:
   - The logic to make elements zero is not correctly implemented. The program does not correctly simulate the operation and does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

The correct output should be `YES`, but the provided program does not correctly handle this case because of the incorrect logic.

### Correct Implementation Example:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even, which is a necessary condition
        if sum(b) % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Try to make all elements zero
        for i in range(1, a - 1):
            if b[i] >= 2 and b[i - 1] >= 1 and b[i + 1] >= 1:
                b[i] -= 2
                b[i - 1] -= 1
                b[i + 1] -= 1
        
        # Check if all elements are zero
        if all(x == 0 for x in b):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the operations are applied correctly and checks if all elements can be made zero. It also includes a necessary condition that the sum of the array must be even for it to be possible to make all elements zero.
