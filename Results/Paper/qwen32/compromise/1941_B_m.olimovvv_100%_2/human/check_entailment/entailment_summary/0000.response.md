### Reasoning:

The given Python program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and processing the array according to the described operations. However, there are some critical issues with the logic used in the program.

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**:
    - The loop iterates from `0` to `a - 3` (inclusive), meaning it stops two elements before the end of the array. This is because `a - 2` would make `i + 2` the last index of the array, and any further operations would be out of bounds.

2. **Incorrect Operation Logic**:
    - The program modifies the array elements in a way that doesn't align with the problem statement. Specifically, it subtracts `b[i] * 2` from `b[i + 1]` and `b[i]` from `b[i + 2]`, and then sets `b[i]` to zero. This logic does not match the operation described, which involves subtracting `1` from `b[i - 1]`, `2` from `b[i]`, and `1` from `b[i + 1]`.

3. **Failure to Check Validity**:
    - The program does not correctly check if the operations can be performed validly. For example, it does not ensure that the elements being subtracted from are non-negative before performing the operations.

4. **Incorrect Termination Condition**:
    - The program checks if the last two elements are zero after processing the array. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the entire array can be made zero using the allowed operations.

### Correctness:
Given the issues outlined above, the provided program is not correct. It does not accurately implement the logic required to determine if the array can be transformed to all zeros using the specified operations.

**Correctness: False**
