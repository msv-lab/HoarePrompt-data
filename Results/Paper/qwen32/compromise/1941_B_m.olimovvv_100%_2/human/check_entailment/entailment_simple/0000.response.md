Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. However, there are several issues in the implementation that make it incorrect:

1. The variable `a` is incorrectly assigned the value of `int(input())`, which should be the length of the list `b`. Instead, it is used as the length of the list in the for loop, which is correct in the code but the variable name is misleading. It should be `n` instead of `a`.
   
2. The logic for reducing the array elements is flawed. The operation described in the problem statement involves reducing three consecutive elements in a specific way, but the code does not correctly implement this. Specifically, the code incorrectly assumes that it can reduce `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]` by `b[i] * 2` and `b[i]` respectively, and then set `b[i]` to zero. This does not match the problem's operation, which involves reducing `b[i-1]`, `b[i]`, and `b[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

3. The code does not handle the case where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros correctly. The check `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0` is not sufficient to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros. There could be negative values or other inconsistencies in the array that are not checked.

4. The code does not handle the case where the array is already all zeros, which should result in "YES".

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
