The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within. This does not affect the values of the variables `a` and `i` directly. The precondition that `a` is greater than `i + 2` remains valid, and the value of `i` is already defined as `i + 1` in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
