Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an integer greater than 2; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input; The current element `b[i]` is less than 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the current element `b[i]` is still less than 0.
