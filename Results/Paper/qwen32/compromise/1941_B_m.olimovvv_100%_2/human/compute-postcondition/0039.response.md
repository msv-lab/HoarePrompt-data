The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which does not affect the values of any variables. It only exits the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `a`, `i`, and the elements of `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`, `b[2]` is `b[2] - b[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
