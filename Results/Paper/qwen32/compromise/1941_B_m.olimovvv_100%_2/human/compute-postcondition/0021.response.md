Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an integer greater than 2; `b[i]` is 0; `b[i + 1]` is unchanged; `b[i + 2]` is unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now the next value that satisfies `i < a - 2`. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
