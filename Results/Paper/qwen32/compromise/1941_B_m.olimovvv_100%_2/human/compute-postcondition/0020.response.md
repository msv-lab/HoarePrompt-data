The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in. This does not affect the values of the variables directly. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop or if statement is terminated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an integer greater than 2; `b[i]` is 0; `b[i + 1]` is unchanged; `b[i + 2]` is unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now the next value that satisfies `i < a - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
