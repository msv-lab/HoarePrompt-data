The code snippet `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the value of `b[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `b[1]` is updated to `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and the condition for breaking out of the loop (if `b[0]` is less than 0) is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `b[1]` is `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`.**
