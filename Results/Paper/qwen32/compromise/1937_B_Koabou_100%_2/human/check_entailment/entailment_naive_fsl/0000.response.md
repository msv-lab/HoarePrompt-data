Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify a potential issue.

The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. The code does not correctly handle the path construction and does not ensure that the path is always the lexicographically smallest.
2. The logic for counting the number of paths that yield the smallest string is flawed.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

### Test Case:
```
1
5
01010
10101
```

### Expected Output:
```
00101
4
```

### Explanation:
- The lexicographically smallest string is `00101`.
- There are 4 paths that yield this string:
  1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (2,5)
  2. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,5)
  3. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (2,5)
  4. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (2,5)

### Actual Output of the Program:
The program does not produce the correct output for this test case. It fails to correctly construct the smallest string and count the number of paths accurately.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect. The logic for constructing the path and counting the number of paths needs to be revised to ensure it works for all test cases as per the problem description.
