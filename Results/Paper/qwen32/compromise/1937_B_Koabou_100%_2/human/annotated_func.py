#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the grid. The next two lines contain binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the 2 × n grid, respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `a` is a list containing two binary strings, each of length `n`, representing the top and bottom rows of the 2 × `n` grid, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` and `x` is `n - 1`. `y` is the last updated value of `y` during the loop.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`, `x` is `n - 1`, `y` is the last updated value of `y` during the loop, `t` is 1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: a[0] + a[1][n - 1] (where a[0] is the first element of list a, a[1] is a list, and n is the length of a[1])
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a 2 × n grid represented by two binary strings of length n. For each test case, it prints a modified string derived from the top and bottom rows and a value of 1.
