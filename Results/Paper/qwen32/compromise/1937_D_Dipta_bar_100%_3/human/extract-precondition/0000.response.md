Precondition: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the directions in each cell of a one-dimensional grid. The length of s, denoted as n, satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5. The function will be called multiple times with different strings s, and the total length of all strings s across all test cases does not exceed 5 ⋅ 10^5.**
