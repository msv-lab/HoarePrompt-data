You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    ><<
    
    4
    
    <<<<
    
    6
    
    <><<<>

Output

    3 6 5 
    1 2 3 4 
    1 4 7 10 8 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the main problems:

1. **Function Definition and Usage**: The function `func_1(s)` is defined but never actually used correctly. Instead, the code directly calls `func_1(s)` without handling its return value or output format properly. The function `func_1(s)` should be designed to return the results for each query and then printed in the main loop.

2. **Logic for Pinball Movement**: The logic within `func_1(s)` is complex and seems to be attempting to optimize the calculation of the number of steps for each pinball by using precomputed arrays `A` and `B`. However, the logic is not straightforward and may contain errors or edge cases that are not handled correctly.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as:
   - A grid with all '<' or all '>'.
   - A grid where the pinball might immediately leave the grid (e.g., a single character grid with '>' or '<').

4. **Output Formatting**: The code uses `print()` statements without proper formatting, which may lead to incorrect output formatting as required by the problem description.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
><<
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 6 5
```

The provided code might not handle this test case correctly due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix the program, one would need to ensure that:
- The function `func_1(s)` correctly computes the number of steps for each pinball and returns the results.
- The main loop correctly handles the input and output formatting.
- The logic within `func_1(s)` is correct and handles all edge cases properly.
