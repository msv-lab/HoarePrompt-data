To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the loop step-by-step. The loop iterates over the string `s` from the end to the beginning, checking for '<' characters. When a '<' is found, it calculates a value based on the indices of previously found '<' characters and appends this value to list `B`. It also keeps track of the indices of '<' characters in `idx_B`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `s` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.
   - `B` starts as an empty list.
   - `idx_B` starts as an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `n` times, with `j` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `i` is calculated as `n - 1 - j`, which means `i` starts at `n-1` and decrements to `0`.
   - If `s[i]` is a '<', the following steps occur:
     - If `idx_B` is empty (i.e., this is the first '<' found), `B` is appended with `0`.
     - Otherwise, a value `x` is calculated as the last element of `B` plus the product of the difference between the last index in `idx_B` and the current index `i`, and the length of `idx_B`. This value `x` is then appended to `B`.
     - The current index `i` is appended to `idx_B`.

3. **Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `B` will contain the cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '<' characters.
   - `idx_B` will contain the indices of all '<' characters found in `s` from the end to the beginning.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose `s = ">>>><<><"` and `n = 8`.

- Initial State:
  - `s = ">>>><<><"`
  - `n = 8`
  - `A` (unchanged)
  - `idx_A` (unchanged)
  - `B = []`
  - `idx_B = []`

- Loop Execution:
  - `j = 0`, `i = 7`, `s[7] = '>'` (no action)
  - `j = 1`, `i = 6`, `s[6] = '>'` (no action)
  - `j = 2`, `i = 5`, `s[5] = '>'` (no action)
  - `j = 3`, `i = 4`, `s[4] = '<'`
    - `idx_B` is empty, so `B.append(0)` → `B = [0]`
    - `idx_B.append(4)` → `idx_B = [4]`
  - `j = 4`, `i = 3`, `s[3] = '>'` (no action)
  - `j = 5`, `i = 2`, `s[2] = '<'`
    - `idx_B` is not empty, so `x = B[-1] + (idx_B[-1] - i) * len(idx_B) = 0 + (4 - 2) * 1 = 2`
    - `B.append(2)` → `B = [0, 2]`
    - `idx_B.append(2)` → `idx_B = [4, 2]`
  - `j = 6`, `i = 1`, `s[1] = '>'` (no action)
  - `j = 7`, `i = 0`, `s[0] = '>'` (no action)

- Final Output State:
  - `s = ">>>><<><"`
  - `n = 8`
  - `A` (unchanged)
  - `idx_A` (unchanged)
  - `B = [0, 2]`
  - `idx_B = [4, 2]`

Output State: **s remains unchanged; n remains unchanged; A contains the cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '>' characters; idx_A contains the indices of '>' characters; B = [0, 2]; idx_B = [4, 2].**
