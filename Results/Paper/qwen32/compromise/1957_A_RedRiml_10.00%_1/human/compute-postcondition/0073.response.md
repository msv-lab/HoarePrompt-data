The only variable in the loop head is `j` and the iterable is `pl`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has taken on some value from the list `pl`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be updated to the next value in `pl`.

State: **`d[j]` is an integer. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged. `j` is the next value in `pl`.** 

However, to be more precise, let's denote the current value of `j` as `j_current`. The next value of `j` would be the subsequent element in the list `pl` after `j_current`. Since we don't know the exact structure of `pl` or the current position of `j_current` within it, we can represent the next value of `j` as `j_next`.

State: **`d[j_next]` is an integer. If `d[j_next]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged. `j` is `j_next`.**
