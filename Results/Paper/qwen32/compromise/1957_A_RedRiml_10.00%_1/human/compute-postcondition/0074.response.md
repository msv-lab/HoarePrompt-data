Output State: **`d[j_next]` is an integer. If `d[j_next]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is increased by 1. `j` is `j_next`.**

Explanation: The value of `shapes` is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition involving `d[j_next]`. Therefore, if `d[j_next]` was originally greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` would have been increased by 1 due to the initial condition and then by another 1 from the given code, making it an increase of 2 in total. If `d[j_next]` was less than 3, `shapes` would simply be increased by 1 from the given code. The value of `j` remains `j_next`.
