The given code snippet increments the count of the integer `i` in the dictionary `d`. If `i` was not already a key in `d`, it will be added with a value of 1. If `i` was already a key, its value will be incremented by 1.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes due to the code snippet is the dictionary `d`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `pl` is a list that may contain `i` as its last element if `i` was not already in `pl` and now `pl` includes the value of `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` following its previous value.**
