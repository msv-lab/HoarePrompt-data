The code snippet `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` to `1`. This means if `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is overwritten to `1`. If `i` was not a key in `d`, it is added with the value `1`.

Given the initial state, `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by `1`. However, the code snippet `d[i] = 1` directly assigns `1` to `d[i]`, regardless of its previous value.

Therefore, the new state of `d` is that it contains the key `i` with the value `1`. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `pl` is a list that may contain `i` as its last element if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary containing the key `i` with the value `1`; `i` is the next element in `palka` following its previous value.**
