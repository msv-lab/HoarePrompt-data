Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `shapes` is 0, `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer in `palka`.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `shapes` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the count of integer `j` in the dictionary `d` is less than 3 or greater than or equal to 3, respectively. `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer, `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must contain at least one integer, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer in `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `shapes` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the count of integer `j_next` in the dictionary `d` was initially less than 3 or greater than or equal to 3, respectively; `w` has been decreased by 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer; `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must contain at least one integer; `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer in `palka`; `j` is `pl[k+1]` where `j` was `pl[k]` in the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `shapes` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether the count of integer `j_next` in the dictionary `d` was initially less than 3 or greater than or equal to 3, respectively; `w` has been decreased by 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer; `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must contain at least one integer; `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer in `palka`; `j` is the next element in `pl` after the current `j`. If `d[j] >= 3`, then `shapes` is set to 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
