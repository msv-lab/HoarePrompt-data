To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes the list `pl` and the dictionary `d`.

The loop iterates over each unique element `j` in the list `pl`, which contains all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared. For each element `j`, it checks if the count of `j` in the dictionary `d` (which tracks the frequency of each element in `palka`) is greater than or equal to 3. If so, it increments the variable `shapes` by 1.

After the loop has processed all elements in `pl`, the variable `shapes` will hold the total count of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.

### Final Output State:
- `t`: Remains unchanged (integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- `n`: Remains unchanged (integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`: Remains unchanged (list of `n` integers where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100).
- `w`: Remains unchanged (input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1).
- `ln`: Remains unchanged (input integer).
- `palka`: Remains unchanged (list of integers read from the input).
- `pl`: Remains unchanged (list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared).
- `d`: Remains unchanged (dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`).
- `shapes`: This variable will be the final count of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.

### Human-readable Description:
The final output state is the same as the initial state except for the variable `shapes`. The value of `shapes` will reflect the number of unique elements in the list `palka` that appear at least three times.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`; `shapes` is the count of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.**
