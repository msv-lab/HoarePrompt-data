Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` and `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`.**

Explanation: The variable `pl` has been reassigned to an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
