To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and understand the components involved:

1. **`palka`**: This is a list of integers from the input.
2. **`pl`**: This is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
3. **`d`**: This is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from `palka` and the values are their respective counts in `palka`.
4. **`shapes`**: This variable holds the total number of unique integers in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`.

Given these definitions, the value of `shapes` is determined by counting how many unique integers in `pl` appear at least 3 times in `d`.

Since the specific values of `palka`, `pl`, and `d` are not provided, we can only describe `shapes` in terms of these definitions.

### Explanation:
- `pl` contains unique integers from `palka`.
- `d` contains the counts of these unique integers.
- `shapes` is the count of integers in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(shapes)` statement will output the number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `d`.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the number of unique integers in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`)**
