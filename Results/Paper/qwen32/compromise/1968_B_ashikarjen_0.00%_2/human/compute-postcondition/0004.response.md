The provided code snippet initializes a variable `j` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `k` is 0; `j` is 0.**
