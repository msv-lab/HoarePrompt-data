To determine the final output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates. The loop increments `j` as long as `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`. Since `i` is fixed at 0, the loop essentially searches for the first occurrence of `a[0]` in the string `b`.

Given the information from the output states after the first 3 iterations, we understand that:
- After 1 iteration, `j` is 1, implying `b[0]` was not equal to `a[0]`.
- After 2 iterations, `j` is 2, implying `b[1]` was also not equal to `a[0]`.
- After 3 iterations, `j` is 3, implying `b[2]` was not equal to `a[0]`.

The loop will continue to increment `j` until either `j` reaches `m` or `b[j]` equals `a[0]`.

Thus, the final state of `j` will be:
- `m` if `a[0]` is not found in `b` within the first `m` characters.
- The index of the first occurrence of `a[0]` in `b` if it is found within the first `m` characters.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a non-empty binary string input; `b` is a non-empty binary string input; `i` is 0; `j` is the index of the first occurrence of `a[0]` in `b` if it exists within the first `m` characters, otherwise `j` is `m`.**

In simpler terms: The loop will stop either when it finds the first occurrence of `a[0]` in `b` (setting `j` to that index) or when it has checked all characters in `b` up to `m` (setting `j` to `m`).
