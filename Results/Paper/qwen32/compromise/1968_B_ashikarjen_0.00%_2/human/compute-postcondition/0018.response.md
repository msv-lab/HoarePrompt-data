Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is set to 1 and `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0 and `j` is set to `m` because no such `j` exists where `b[j] == a[i]` and `0 ≤ j < m`.**
