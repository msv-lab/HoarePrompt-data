Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a non-empty binary string input; `b` is a non-empty binary string input; `i` is 0; `j` is `m` because the first occurrence of `a[0]` in `b` does not exist within the first `m` characters.**
