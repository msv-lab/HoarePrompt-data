To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables `j`, `m`, `b`, and `a[i]` as they are the ones mentioned in the loop head condition `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `j`:** This is the index variable for string `b`. For the loop to start, `j` must be less than `m`. Right before the loop, `j` is not mentioned, so we can assume it is typically initialized to 0 for such loops.

2. **Variable `m`:** This is the length of string `b`. Since `j` is initialized to 0 and `j < m` is the condition, `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

3. **Variable `b`:** This is the binary string. The condition `b[j] != a[i]` requires that the character at index `j` in string `b` is not equal to the character at index `i` in string `a`. Since `j` is 0, `b[0]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

4. **Variable `a[i]`:** This is the character at index `i` in string `a`. The condition `b[j] != a[i]` requires that `a[i]` is different from `b[0]`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before the loop, we need to ensure that `a[i]` is valid. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the initial value of `i` before the increment must be such that `a[i]` is a valid character in string `a`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `j` should be initialized to 0.
- `m` should be greater than 0.
- `b[0]` should not be equal to `a[i]`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 before the loop, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to a value such that `a[i]` is a valid character in string `a` and `b[0] != a[i]`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `i` is 0 (before increment); `j` is 0; `b[0]` is not equal to `a[1]`**.

However, since `i` is incremented by 1 before the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be -1 initially so that after incrementing, `i` is 0, and we can check `a[0]` against `b[0]`.

So the final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `i` is -1 (before increment); `j` is 0; `b[0]` is not equal to `a[0]`**.
