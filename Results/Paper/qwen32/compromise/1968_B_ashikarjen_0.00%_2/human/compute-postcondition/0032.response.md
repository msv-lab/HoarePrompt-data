Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `i` is -1. If `j` is less than `m`, then `j` is now less than `m` plus 1 and `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains `m` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
