To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`. Here, `j` and `m` are the only variables directly involved in the loop condition. The variable `i` is not mentioned in the loop condition, so we do not need to adjust it.

1. **Variable `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `j` must be less than `m`. Since `j` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 1.

2. **Variable `m`:**
   - The variable `m` is already given to be in the range 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - We need to ensure that `m` is greater than `j` (which is currently 1). So, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

3. **Variable `b[j]` and `a[i]`:**
   - The condition `b[j] != a[i]` must be true for the loop to continue.
   - Since `i` is not in the loop condition, we do not need to adjust `i`. However, we need to ensure that `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` for the current `j` (which is 1) and some `i`.
   - Given that `b[0] != a[0]`, we can assume that `a[i]` for the current `i` is not equal to `b[1]` to satisfy the condition `b[j] != a[i]`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `m`. Specifically, `j` should remain 1 (as it is already), and `m` should be at least 2. The condition `b[j] != a[i]` should naturally hold given the problem constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `m` must be at least 2; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input such that `b[0] != a[0]`; `k` is 0; `j` is 1**
