### Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m`, representing the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Prefix Length**:
   - The function initializes two pointers: `k` to count the length of the maximum prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` to traverse through string `b`.
   - It iterates through each character in string `a` using a for loop.
   - For each character `a[i]` in string `a`, it uses a while loop to find the first occurrence of `a[i]` in string `b` starting from index `j`.
   - If `a[i]` is found in `b` (i.e., `j < m`), it increments `k` and moves the pointer `j` to the next position in `b`.
   - If `a[i]` is not found in `b` (i.e., `j == m`), it breaks out of the loop as no further characters of `a` can form a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all characters of `a` or breaking early, the function prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the function with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `n=5`, `m=4`, `a="10011"`, `b="1110"`
   - Process: The function correctly identifies that the prefix "10" of `a` is a subsequence of `b` but "100" is not. Thus, `k=2`.
   - Output: `2`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `n=3`, `m=3`, `a="100"`, `b="110"`
   - Process: The function identifies that the prefix "10" of `a` is a subsequence of `b`. Thus, `k=2`.
   - Output: `2`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `n=1`, `m=3`, `a="1"`, `b="111"`
   - Process: The function identifies that the prefix "1" of `a` is a subsequence of `b`. Thus, `k=1`.
   - Output: `1`

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `n=4`, `m=4`, `a="1011"`, `b="1111"`
   - Process: The function identifies that the prefix "101" of `a` is a subsequence of `b`. Thus, `k=1`.
   - Output: `1`

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `n=3`, `m=5`, `a="100"`, `b="11010"`
   - Process: The function identifies that the entire string `a` is a subsequence of `b`. Thus, `k=3`.
   - Output: `3`

6. **Test Case 6**:
   - Input: `n=3`, `m=1`, `a="100"`, `b="0"`
   - Process: The function identifies that no characters of `a` are in `b`. Thus, `k=0`.
   - Output: `0`

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the function is confirmed.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
