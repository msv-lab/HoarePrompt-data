To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `n` is an integer.
- `m` is 0.
- `x` is unchanged (its value is not relevant for this particular print statement).
- `ans` is a set.
- If 0 is in `ans`, then `ans` contains the integer `n`. Otherwise, `ans` does not contain 0.

The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the number of elements in the set `ans`.

There are two possible scenarios for the set `ans` based on the condition provided:

1. **0 is in `ans`**: 
   - In this case, `ans` contains at least the integer 0.
   - Additionally, according to the condition, `ans` also contains the integer `n`.
   - Therefore, `ans` contains at least two elements: 0 and `n`.
   - The length of `ans` will be at least 2.

2. **0 is not in `ans`**:
   - In this case, `ans` does not contain the integer 0.
   - Since there is no other information provided about the contents of `ans`, we can only conclude that `ans` is empty or contains elements other than 0 and `n`.
   - However, the condition explicitly states that if 0 is not in `ans`, then `ans` does not contain `n` either.
   - Therefore, `ans` must be empty.
   - The length of `ans` will be 0.

Given the condition, the only concrete information we have is that `ans` either contains exactly two elements (0 and `n`) or it is empty. Therefore, the possible values for `len(ans)` are 0 or 2.

However, since the problem does not provide additional information to determine whether 0 is in `ans` or not, we must consider both possibilities.

Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is either 0 or 2 based on whether 0 is in the set ans or not)**
