The given code snippet initializes an empty set named `temp`. This action does not affect the values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`). Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the addition of the `temp` set.

Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains all computed values `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` based on the value of `c`, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as an integer), and `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string), `temp` is an empty set.**
