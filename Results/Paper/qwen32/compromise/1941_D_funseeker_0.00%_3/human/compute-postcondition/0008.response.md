The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. This element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are returned by `func_3()`, and `m` must be greater than 0. The variable `ans` is a set containing `x`. The variable `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, and `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]` and is either '0' or '?'. The variable `temp` is initially an empty set.

After executing the code, `temp` will contain the new element `(q + r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]` and `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n`.**
