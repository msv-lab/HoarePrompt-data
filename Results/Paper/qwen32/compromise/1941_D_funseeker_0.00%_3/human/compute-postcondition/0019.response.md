Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing at least one more element besides `x`, `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set. `q` is `q_next`, where `q_next` is the next element in `ans` other than the current `q`. `temp` now includes `(q + r) % n`.**

In natural language: The value of `temp` has been updated to include `(q + r) % n`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
