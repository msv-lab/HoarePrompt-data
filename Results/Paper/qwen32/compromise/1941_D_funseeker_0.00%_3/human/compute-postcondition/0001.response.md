The given Python code snippet creates a set `ans` containing the single element `x`. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this operation. The output state will reflect the updated value of `ans` and retain the values of `n` and `m` as they were initially obtained from `func_3()`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `ans` is a set containing `x`.**
