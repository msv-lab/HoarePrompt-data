The only variable in the loop head is `q`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `ans`. If `ans` contains more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element in `ans`. At the end of the last iteration, `q` was the last element in `ans`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must contain at least one more element that `q` has not yet taken.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing at least one more element besides `x`, `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**
