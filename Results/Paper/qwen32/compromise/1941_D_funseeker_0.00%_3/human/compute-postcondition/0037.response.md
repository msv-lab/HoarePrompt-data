The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. The values of `n`, `q`, and `r` are used in this calculation. The other variables (`m`, `x`, `ans`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is still greater than 0, `x` and `ans` are sets containing at least one value, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]`, `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, `temp` now contains an additional element `(q + r) % n`.**
