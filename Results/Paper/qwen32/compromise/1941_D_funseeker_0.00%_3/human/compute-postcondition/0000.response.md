The code snippet provided assigns new values to `n`, `m`, and `x` by calling the function `func_3()`. This means the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are overwritten by whatever values `func_3()` returns. The preconditions on the new values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are not specified, so we can only assume they will be whatever `func_3()` outputs.

Since the function `func_3()` is not defined, we can't determine the exact new values of `n`, `m`, and `x`. However, we can state that after the function call, `n`, `m`, and `x` will hold the values returned by `func_3()`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.**
