Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]`.**

In this output state, `r` has been converted to an integer from the first element of the string split returned by `func_1()`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `c` remain unchanged from the initial state.
