Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Reading Functions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line from the standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Reads an integer from the standard input.
   - `func_3()`: Reads a line from the standard input, splits it by whitespace, and converts each split part into an integer, returning the list of integers.

2. **Main Function (`func_4`)**:
   - The function starts by reading three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` which represent the number of players, the number of throws, and the starting player, respectively.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible positions the ball could be in after each throw.
   - For each of the `m` throws, the function reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction:
     - If the direction is `'0'` (clockwise) or `'?'` (unknown), it adds the new position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp` for each current position `q` in `ans`.
     - If the direction is `'1'` (counterclockwise) or `'?'` (unknown), it adds the new position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp` for each current position `q` in `ans`.
   - After processing each throw, the set `ans` is updated to be `temp`.
   - After all throws, the function checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` if it is. This is a bit of a workaround to handle the modulo operation correctly for positions.
   - Finally, the function prints the number of possible positions and the sorted list of those positions.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the circular nature of the problem using modulo operations.
   - The program correctly handles the unknown direction by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise possibilities.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the modulo operation might result in `0` by converting it to `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the number of possible players who could have the ball and their sorted indices, which matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the specified cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
