The function accepts three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` where `n` is a positive integer, and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there is any position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES'. If no such position exists after checking all positions, it returns 'NO'.
