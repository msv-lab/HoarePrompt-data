Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and its function summaries to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

For a string to match a template:
- If the template character is lowercase, the corresponding string character must be the same.
- If the template character is uppercase, the corresponding string character must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Function `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**:
   - This function iterates over each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - It checks if `a[i]` is different from `c[i]` and `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`.
   - If such a position is found, it returns `'YES'`, indicating that a template exists where `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not.
   - If no such position is found after the loop, it returns `'NO'`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness of the Provided Program:

#### Evaluation of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` checks if there exists a position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
- If such a position is found, it means we can construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), ensuring `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template while `c[i]` does not.
- If no such position is found, it means for every position `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or both) are the same as `c[i]`, making it impossible to construct a template that satisfies the conditions for all positions.

#### Validation with Examples:
- **First Test Case**:
  - `a = 'a'`, `b = 'b'`, `c = 'c'`
  - At position `0`, `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]`.
  - Therefore, a template `t = 'C'` can be constructed, and the function correctly returns `'YES'`.

- **Second Test Case**:
  - `a = 'aa'`, `b = 'bb'`, `c = 'aa'`
  - At position `0`, `a[0] == c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]`.
  - At position `1`, `a[1] == c[1]` and `b[1] != c[1]`.
  - There is no position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
  - Therefore, no template can be constructed, and the function correctly returns `'NO'`.

- **Third Test Case**:
  - `a = 'mathforces'`, `b = 'luckforces'`, `c = 'adhoccoder'`
  - At position `0`, `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]`.
  - Therefore, a template `t` can be constructed where `t[0]` is the uppercase version of `a[0]` or `b[0]`, and the function correctly returns `'YES'`.

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - `a = 'acc'`, `b = 'abd'`, `c = 'abc'`
  - At position `0`, `a[0] == c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]`.
  - At position `1`, `a[1] == b[1]` and `a[1] != c[1]`.
  - At position `2`, `a[2] != b[2]` and `a[2] == c[2]`.
  - There is no position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
  - Therefore, no template can be constructed, and the function correctly returns `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. The function `func_1` effectively checks for the necessary condition by ensuring that for at least one position, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Final: **True**
