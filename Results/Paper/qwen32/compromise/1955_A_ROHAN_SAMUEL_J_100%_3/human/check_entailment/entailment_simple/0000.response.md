### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to handle multiple test cases where Maxim needs to buy a certain number of yogurts (n) at the minimum cost, given the regular price (a) and the promotion price (b) for two yogurts. 

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts).

2. **Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2` is true), the program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying yogurts individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the cost is `n // 2 * b` (cost for pairs of yogurts) plus `a` (cost for the extra yogurt).
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2` is false), the program again checks if `2 * a < b`.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying yogurts individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the cost is `n // 2 * b` (cost for pairs of yogurts).

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the minimum cost.

Let's verify the logic with the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a (10) > b (9)`, the cost is `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
  
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a (10) > b (9)`, the cost is `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
  
- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a (10) < b (11)`, the cost is `a * n = 3 * 5 = 15`.
  
- **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a (10) < b (11)`, the cost is `a * n = 4 * 5 = 20`.

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case as per the example outputs.

### Conclusion:
The program logic is correct and matches the problem requirements.
