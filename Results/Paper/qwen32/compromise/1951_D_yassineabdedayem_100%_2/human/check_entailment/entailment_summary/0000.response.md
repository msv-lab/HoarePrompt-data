### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem requires Bob to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program provided only handles a few specific cases and does not fully address the problem:

1. **Case 1**: If `n == k`, the program correctly outputs "YES", `1`, and `1`. This is because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying one jewel at a price of 1 coin each.
2. **Case 2**: If `n + 2 > k * 2`, the program outputs "YES", `2`, and prices `(n - k + 1, 1)`. This is a bit more complex and requires verification:
   - Alice will buy `1` jewel at the first stall at a price of `(n - k + 1)`, leaving her with `k - 1` coins.
   - Then, Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels at the second stall at a price of `1` each, spending the remaining `k - 1` coins.
   - This results in Alice buying exactly `k` jewels.
3. **Remaining Cases**: The program outputs "NO" for all other cases, which is not necessarily correct. There are many other configurations of stalls and prices that could result in Alice buying exactly `k` jewels.

The provided program does not cover all possible scenarios and configurations of stalls and prices. The program's logic is limited and does not guarantee that the solution is correct for all valid inputs.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program is not correct for all possible inputs as it does not explore all possible configurations of stalls and prices. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
