**Reasoning:**

The provided program attempts to determine if it's possible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins by setting up stalls with specific prices. However, the logic in the program is incomplete and incorrect for the problem requirements. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Case 1: `n == k`**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `n` equals `k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.

2. **Case 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if `n + 2 > k * 2`, it's possible to buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up two stalls. The prices chosen (`n - k + 1` and `1`) do not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all cases. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the program would output "YES" with prices `8` and `1`. Alice would buy 1 jewel at the first stall (spending 8 coins) and 2 jewels at the second stall (spending 2 coins), totaling 3 jewels, which is correct for this specific case. However, this approach is not generalizable and does not work for all values of `n` and `k`.

3. **General Case**
   - The program does not handle the general case where `n` is significantly larger than `k` or where `n + 2 <= k * 2`. The logic to determine if it's possible to buy exactly `k` jewels with up to 60 stalls is missing. A correct approach would involve setting up stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels by using a greedy strategy.

**Conclusion:**

The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels for arbitrary values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
