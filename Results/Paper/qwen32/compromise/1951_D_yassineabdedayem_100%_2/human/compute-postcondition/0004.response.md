Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins, and outputs "YES" along with the number of coins spent and the number of coins left if possible, otherwise it outputs "NO".**
