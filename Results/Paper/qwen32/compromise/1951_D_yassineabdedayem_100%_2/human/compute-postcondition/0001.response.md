The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is just a throwaway variable used for iteration, the only state that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, so for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given that `t` is an input integer, and the problem states that each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `k`, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The values of `n` and `k` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, only the logic inside the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
