Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers with length `n`, `i` is the current value of i plus 1, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing all the unique values from `w` that have a count greater than 0, `j` is 1, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`**

In natural language, the value of `res` has been updated by adding the result of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
