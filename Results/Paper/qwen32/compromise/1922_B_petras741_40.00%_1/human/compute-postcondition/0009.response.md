The code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Given the initial state, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros. After executing the code, the value at the index `w[j]` in `q` will be 1 (assuming it was 0 before, which is the case for all indices initially).

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer with a value greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[j]]` which is 1.**
