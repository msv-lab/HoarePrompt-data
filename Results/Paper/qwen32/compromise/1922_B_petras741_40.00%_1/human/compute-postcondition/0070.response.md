Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1` if `n` was less than 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with the element at index `w[j]` incremented by `n` for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is an empty list, `eta_ln`, `rho`, `res` are unchanged or not defined if `n` is less than 3, `j` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes an empty list `eta`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
