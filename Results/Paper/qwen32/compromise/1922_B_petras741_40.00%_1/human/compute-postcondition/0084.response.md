Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1` if `n` was less than 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with the element at index `w[j]` incremented by `n` for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing all `j` (0 ≤ j ≤ n) where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is equal to 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, `res` are unchanged or not defined if `n` is less than 3, and `j` is `n + 1`.**
