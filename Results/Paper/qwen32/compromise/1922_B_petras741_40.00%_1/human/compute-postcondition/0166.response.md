Let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `buffer` is an empty list.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1.
- `n` is less than 3.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(0)
```

**Analysis:**
The print statement `print(0)` is straightforward. It prints the integer `0` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, and `i` because the print statement does not reference any of these variables.

**Output:**
Output: **0**
