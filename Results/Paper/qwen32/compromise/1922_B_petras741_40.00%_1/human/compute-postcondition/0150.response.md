The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. According to the loop statement, `j` iterates from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `eta_ln` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `buffer` is an empty list.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `w` is a list of integers with length `n`.
- `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1.
- `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`.
- `eta` is a list containing all the unique values from `w` that have a count greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `eta_ln` must be greater than 1.
- `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]]`.
- `res` is `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.

Since `j` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 2.
