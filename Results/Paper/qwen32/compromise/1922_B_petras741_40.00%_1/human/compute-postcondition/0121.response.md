Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `n` must be greater than `j + 1`
- `j` is `j + 1`

Code Snippet:
```python
q[w[j]] += 1
```

Explanation:
- The code accesses the list `q` using the index `w[j]` and increments the value at that index by 1.
- The value of `j` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, so `j` is now `j + 1`.
- The value of `n` remains as it is, but it must still be greater than the new value of `j`, which is `j + 1 + 1` or `j + 2`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `j + 2`, `j` is `j + 1`, and the value at `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.**

Natural language explanation:
- The value of `j` is now `j + 1` as per the initial state.
- The condition `n` must be greater than `j + 2` still holds true.
- The value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` has been incremented by 1.
