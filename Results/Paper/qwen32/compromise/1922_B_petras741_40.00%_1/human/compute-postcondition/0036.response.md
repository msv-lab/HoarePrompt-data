The code snippet `rho += q[eta[j]]` increments the value of `rho` by the value of `q[eta[j]]`.

Given the initial state:
- `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`
- `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0
- `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `w`

After executing the code snippet, `rho` is updated to its previous value plus `q[eta[j]]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `buffer` is an empty list; `n` is an input integer with a value greater than or equal to 3; `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `w`; `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0; `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` and must be greater than 1; `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]]`; `res` is updated to `res + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.**
