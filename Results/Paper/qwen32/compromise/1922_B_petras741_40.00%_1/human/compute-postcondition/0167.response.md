Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, then `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list of unique values from `w` that have a count greater than 0, `j` is updated to either `n` if `eta_ln` equals 1, or `eta_ln` otherwise, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` equals 1, or the sum of all `q[eta[k]]` for `k` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` otherwise, and `res` is the sum of all contributions from each `eta[j]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` if `eta_ln` does not equal 1. If `n` is less than 3, then no additional changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `j`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`.**
