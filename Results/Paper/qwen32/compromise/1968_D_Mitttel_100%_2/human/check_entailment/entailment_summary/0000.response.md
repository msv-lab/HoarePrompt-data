### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the problem description in detail to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjustments**:
   - The program adjusts the permutation and array indices to be 0-based by subtracting 1 from each element in `p` and `a`.

3. **Scoring Calculation**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - The function uses a loop to traverse the permutation, updating the cumulative score `cur` and checking if the current score plus the remaining turns multiplied by the current array value exceeds the maximum score `mx` seen so far.
   - The loop continues until a position is revisited or `k` turns are completed.

4. **Comparison of Scores**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates the maximum score for both Bodya and Sasha using the `func_1` function.
   - It then compares the scores and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

### Analysis of the Execution Summary:

- The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the `func_1` function. It calculates the maximum possible score a player can achieve by either staying or moving according to the permutation, considering the remaining turns.
- The function ensures that it does not revisit a position and continues until `k` turns are completed or a cycle is detected.
- The comparison of scores and the output logic are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It accurately calculates the maximum scores for both players and determines the winner based on these scores.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
