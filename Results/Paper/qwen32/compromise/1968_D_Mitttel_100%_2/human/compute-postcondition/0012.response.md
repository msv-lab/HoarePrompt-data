The code snippet updates the value of `mx` by comparing its current value with `cur + k * a[s]`. Since `cur` is initially set to `a[s]`, the expression `cur + k * a[s]` becomes `a[s] + k * a[s]` which simplifies to `a[s] * (k + 1)`. The variable `mx` will take the maximum value between its current value and `a[s] * (k + 1)`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is `p[P_S]` and `s` is not equal to `P_B`, `k` is at least 1, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * (k + 1)`, `cur` is `a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and the integer at index `s` is 1 and all other integers are 0.**
