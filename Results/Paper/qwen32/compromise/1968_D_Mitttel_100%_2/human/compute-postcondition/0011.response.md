Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is `p[P_S]` and `s` is not equal to `P_B`, `k` is at least 1, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `cur` is `a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and the integer at index `s` is 1 and all other integers are 0.**

In simpler terms, the value at index `s` in the `vis` list has been updated to 1, indicating that the element `s` has been visited. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
