The code snippet `cur += a[s]` increments the value of `cur` by the value of `a[s]`. Given the initial state, `cur` is initially set to `2 * a[s]`.

Let's update `cur`:
- Initially, `cur` is `2 * a[s]`.
- After the code executes, `cur` becomes `2 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[s]`.

The other variables (`a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `mx`, and `vis`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is `p[p[P_S]]` and `s` is not equal to `P_B`, `k` is at least 1, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * (k + 1)` and `cur + k * a[s]`, `cur` is `3 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and the integer at index `s` is 1 and all other integers are 0.**
