### Reasoning:

The provided program appears to be attempting to solve the problem as described, but there are several issues with its logic:

1. **Incorrect Insertion and Removal Logic**:
   - The program attempts to insert elements from `b` into `a` and remove the last element of `a` when `b[j] < a[i]`. However, the insertion logic is flawed. The line `a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]` does not correctly simulate the insertion and sorting process as described in the problem statement. Instead, it incorrectly places `b[j]` at index `i` and shifts the rest of the list, which is not the same as inserting `b[j]` and then sorting the list.
   - The removal of the last element of `a` is correct, but it should be done after the insertion and sorting.

2. **Logic for Counting New Problems**:
   - The program increments `cnt` every time it inserts an element from `b` into `a`, which is correct. However, due to the flawed insertion logic, the count may not reflect the actual minimum number of new problems needed.

3. **Sorting Requirement**:
   - The problem specifies that after each insertion, the list `a` should be sorted in non-decreasing order. The provided program does not sort `a` after each insertion and removal operation.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is not used in the provided program and appears to be a leftover or a misunderstanding of the problem requirements. It sorts the entire list in descending order, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the insertion and sorting logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
