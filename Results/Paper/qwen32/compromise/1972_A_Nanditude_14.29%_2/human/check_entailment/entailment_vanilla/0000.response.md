Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding:
- We have two lists, `a` and `b`, both of length `n`, representing the current difficulties and the expected difficulties of `n` problems, respectively.
- Both lists are initially sorted in non-decreasing order.
- We need to make sure that `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i` by inserting new problems and removing the most difficult one after each insertion.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of new problems that need to be inserted.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the list `a`, and the list `b`.

2. **Logic:**
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems inserted.
   - It uses two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through the lists `a` and `b`.
   - The logic is supposed to ensure that `a[i] <= b[i]` by comparing elements from both lists:
     - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current expected difficulty is less than the current actual difficulty, so it should insert a problem with difficulty `b[j]` and remove the most difficult problem from `a`.
     - It increments the counter `cnt` and moves both pointers `i` and `j` to the next element.
     - If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current actual difficulty is already within the expected difficulty, so it just moves to the next problem in both lists.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all problems in a test case, it prints the counter `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of new problems inserted.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
- The program does not sort the list `a` after inserting a new problem with difficulty `b[j]`. The problem statement clearly specifies that after inserting a new problem, the list `a` should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The line `a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]` does not correctly simulate the insertion and removal of the most difficult problem. It simply replaces the `i`-th element of `a` with `b[j]`, which does not match the problem's requirement.
- The function `func_1(arr)` is defined but never used in the program.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
