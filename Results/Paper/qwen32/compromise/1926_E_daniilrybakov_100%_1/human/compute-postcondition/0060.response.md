The code snippet `s = 0` sets the variable `s` to 0. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `t`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), `t` is `t - 1`**.
