In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer input value such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate through the range of `t`, and it does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The only variable in the loop head is `t`. The loop will execute if and only if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is provided as an input value such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), it is guaranteed that `t` will be at least 1, and thus the loop will execute.

The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned in the state before the loop starts, but they are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. They can remain as they are.

Thus, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute based on the provided loop head variables.

State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
