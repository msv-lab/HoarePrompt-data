To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition. The `while` loop condition is `while n:` which means the loop will continue as long as `n` is not zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is `n // 2`
- `k` is an input integer
- `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`
- `m` is 2
- `t` is `t - 1`

The only variable in the loop head is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero after the previous iteration.

Since `n` is updated to `n // 2` in the previous iteration, for `n` to be non-zero in the current iteration, it must have been greater than 1 in the previous iteration (because `1 // 2` results in 0).

Thus, the state at the end of the previous iteration should be such that `n` was greater than 1 before it was halved.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1 before it was halved, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 2, `t` is `t - 1`**
