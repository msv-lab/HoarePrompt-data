The code snippet `x = (n + 1) // 2` reassigns the value of `x` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Given that `x` was initially defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, reassigning it to the same expression does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `x` remains `(n + 1) // 2`.

Since the value of `x` does not change, and no other variables are affected, the output state remains the same as the initial state for `x`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `2 * x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
