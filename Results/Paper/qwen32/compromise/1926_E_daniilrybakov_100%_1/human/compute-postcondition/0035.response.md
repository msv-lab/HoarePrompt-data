Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is a non-zero integer, specifically `n` is the integer division of the original `n` by 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\); `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Natural Language: The value of `n` is updated to be the result of integer division of its original value by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
