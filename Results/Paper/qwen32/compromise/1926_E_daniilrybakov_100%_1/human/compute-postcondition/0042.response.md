The code snippet `x = (n + 1) // 2` reassigns the value of `x` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `x` was already defined as `(n + 1) // 2` in the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `x`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` must be a non-zero integer; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\); `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 2; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
