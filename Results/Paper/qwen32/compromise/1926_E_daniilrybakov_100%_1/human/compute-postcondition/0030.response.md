The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` was initially 0, but this value is overwritten by the input. The value of `k` is also read from the input and replaces its initial value of an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), but since `n` is now set by the input, `k` will be between 1 and the newly assigned `n`.

The values of `t`, `s`, and `m` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `s` is the cumulative sum at the point of termination, `m` is the power of 2 corresponding to the number of iterations.**
