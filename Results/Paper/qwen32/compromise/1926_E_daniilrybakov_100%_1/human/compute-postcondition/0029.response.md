The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. However, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since the loop iterates `t` times, at the start of each iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 until it reaches 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` is 0
- `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `s` is the cumulative sum at the point of termination
- `m` is the power of 2 corresponding to the number of iterations

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1. The other variables `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is the cumulative sum at the point of termination, `m` is the power of 2 corresponding to the number of iterations**
