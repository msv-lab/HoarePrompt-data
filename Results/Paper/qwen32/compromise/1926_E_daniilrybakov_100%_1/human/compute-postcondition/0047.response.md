Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is now `n // 2`; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq k \leq \text{original } n\); `s` is `original n + 1`; `m` is 4; `x` is `(original n + 1) // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been updated to 4 because it was multiplied by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
