The code snippet provided takes input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer input value, but it is not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, `t` remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
