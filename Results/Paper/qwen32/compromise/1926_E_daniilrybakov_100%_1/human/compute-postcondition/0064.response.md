The code `n //= 2` modifies the value of `n` by performing integer division by 2. Given the initial state, `n` is a non-zero integer. After the operation, `n` will be half of its original value, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Output State: **`n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

In natural language: `n` is now half of its original value, rounded down to the nearest integer. The values of `k`, `s`, `m`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged.
