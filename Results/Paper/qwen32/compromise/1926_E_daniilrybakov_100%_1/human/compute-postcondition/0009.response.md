Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s < k` and `k <= s + x`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
