The code snippet provided initializes a variable `s` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is 0.**
