Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card Vladislav lays down according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the program's approach:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads `n` (the total number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to find).
3. **Binary Search Approach**: The program uses a binary search-like method to determine the k-th card:
   - It initializes `s` (a counter for the number of cards laid down so far) to 0 and `m` (a multiplier to determine the sequence of cards) to 1.
   - It calculates the number of odd-numbered cards that can be laid down in the current sequence (`x`), which is `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - It then checks if the k-th card falls within the range of cards that can be laid down in the current sequence (`s < k <= s + x`). If it does, the loop breaks.
   - If not, it updates `s` by adding `x` (since these cards are laid down) and doubles `m` to move to the next sequence (cards that are multiples of the next integer).
4. **Determine the k-th Card**: Once the loop breaks, the program calculates the k-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`, which correctly identifies the card based on the sequence and position.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and correctly outputs the k-th card for each test case, making it a correct solution to the problem.
