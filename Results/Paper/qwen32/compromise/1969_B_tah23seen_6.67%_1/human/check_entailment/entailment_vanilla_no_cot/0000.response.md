Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the allowed cyclic shifts. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not account for all necessary operations to achieve the sorted order. Specifically, it only swaps '1's with '0's when they are adjacent and does not consider the cost of shifting larger substrings that might be necessary to bring all '0's to the front or all '1's to the end.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to calculate the cost of moving all '1's to the end or all '0's to the beginning, considering the minimal number of cyclic shifts required. This involves more complex logic than what is implemented in the given code.
