### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
- The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
- We aim to minimize the total cost of sorting the string.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a binary string, and processes each string using the `func_1` function.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Initialization**:
  - Converts the input string `sChar` into a list `s`.
  - Initializes `left` to 0, `right` to 1, and `cost` to 0.
  
- **Main Loop**:
  - Continues as long as `left <= right`, `right < len(s)`, and `left < len(s)`.
  - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', it swaps these characters and adds `right - left + 1` to the cost.
  - Advances `right` until it finds a '0'.
  - Advances `left` until it finds a '1'.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation logic is flawed. The program only swaps '1's with '0's directly adjacent to each other and adds the cost based on the distance between them. However, this does not necessarily yield the minimum cost for sorting the entire string.
   
2. **Sorting Strategy**:
   - The strategy of swapping adjacent '1's and '0's does not guarantee a fully sorted string. It might leave some '1's and '0's out of order, especially in more complex strings.
   
3. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop condition `left <= right` can lead to infinite loops or incorrect behavior. For example, if `left` and `right` do not move correctly, the loop might not terminate as expected.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where there are multiple '1's and '0's that need to be rearranged in a specific order to achieve a sorted string.

#### Verification Using Function Summary:
The function summary states that `func_1` calculates the total cost required to rearrange each string such that all '0's come before all '1's. However, the implementation does not correctly achieve this due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues and the analysis of the function's behavior, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string as per the problem requirements.

**Final: False**
