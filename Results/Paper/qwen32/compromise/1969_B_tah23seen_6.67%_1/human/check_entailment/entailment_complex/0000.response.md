### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the binary string and swapping '0's and '1's to achieve a sorted configuration. However, there are several issues with the logic that make the solution incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Swapping Logic**: The code tries to swap elements directly when it encounters a '0' after a '1', but it does not correctly handle the cost calculation or the actual rearrangement of the string. The cost calculation assumes that every swap involves the entire substring between `left` and `right`, which is not accurate. The cost should reflect the minimal number of operations needed to move the '0' to the correct position, not the length of the substring.

2. **Inefficient Handling of Multiple '0's and '1's**: The code uses nested loops to find the next '0' and '1' to swap, which can be inefficient and does not guarantee the minimum cost. It should aim to move each '0' to the earliest possible position without unnecessary swaps.

3. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost is calculated as `right - left + 1`, which is not the correct way to compute the cost of moving a single '0' to its correct position. The cost should be the distance moved by the '0'.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases well, such as strings that are already sorted or strings with all '0's or all '1's.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the provided program is not correct for the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is:

**Correctness: False**
