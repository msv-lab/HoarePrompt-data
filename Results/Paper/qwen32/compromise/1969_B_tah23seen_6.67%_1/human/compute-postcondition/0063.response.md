The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`right`, `s`, and `cost`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`right` is the smallest index such that `right >= len(s)` or `s[right] == '0'`; `left` is 2; `s[1]` is not `'1'`; `s` and `cost` remain unchanged unless the swap condition is met outside the loop.**
