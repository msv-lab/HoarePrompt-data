The value of `right` is incremented by 1. Given that `right` was initially 2, it is now 3. The other variables (`sChar`, `s`, `left`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order, with `s[1]` being '1' and `s[2]` being '1'; `left` is 0; `right` is 3 and len(s) > 2.**
