To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `right < len(s)` - This ensures that `right` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
2. `s[right] != '0'` - This ensures that the character at index `right` in `s` is not '0'.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`.
- `right` is the index of the first '1' in `s` plus 1.
- `s` must contain at least one '1'.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that both conditions in the loop head are satisfied.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition `right < len(s)`**: 
   - Currently, `right` is set to `left + 1`. For this condition to be true, `left + 1` must be less than the length of `s`. Therefore, `s` must have at least two characters starting from the first '1'.
   
2. **Condition `s[right] != '0'`**:
   - Since `right` is `left + 1`, the character at index `right` should not be '0'. This means the character immediately following the first '1' in `s` should not be '0'.

### Adjustments:
- To ensure `right < len(s)`, `s` must have at least two characters starting from the first '1'. This means the string `s` should have at least one more character after the first '1'.
- To ensure `s[right] != '0'`, the character at index `right` (which is `left + 1`) should be something other than '0'. Given that we want the loop to continue, let's assume it should be '1' (since '1' is a valid character that would allow the loop to continue).

### Final State:
- `left` remains the index of the first '1' in `s`.
- `right` remains `left + 1`.
- The character at index `right` in `s` should be '1' to satisfy `s[right] != '0'`.
- `s` must have at least two characters starting from the first '1'.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`; `right` is `left + 1`; `s[right]` is '1'; `s` must have at least two characters starting from the first '1'**
