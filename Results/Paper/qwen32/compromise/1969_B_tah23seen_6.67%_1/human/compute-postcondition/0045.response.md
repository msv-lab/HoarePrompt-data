To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

```
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `left < len(s)`
2. `s[left] != '1'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `left` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not '1', incremented by 1.

This means that at the end of the previous iteration, `s[left - 1]` was not '1', but `s[left]` could either be '1' or out of bounds (if `left` equals `len(s)`).

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that:
- `left` is still within the bounds of the string `s` (`left < len(s)`).
- The character at index `left` in `s` is not '1' (`s[left] != '1'`).

Since `left` has already been incremented by 1 from the index of the first non-'1' character, we need to adjust the state such that `s[left]` is not '1'. We do not need to change `left` itself because it is already incremented correctly based on the problem description.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `s[left]` is not '1'.

State: **`left` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not '1', incremented by 1, and `s[left]` is not '1'**.
