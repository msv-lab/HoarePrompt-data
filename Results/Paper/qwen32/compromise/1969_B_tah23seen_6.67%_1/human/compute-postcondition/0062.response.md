To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as:
1. `left` is less than the length of the string `s`.
2. The character at index `left` in the string `s` is not `'1'`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `right` is the smallest index such that `right >= len(s)` or `s[right] == '0'`.
- `left` is 1.
- `s` and `cost` remain unchanged unless the swap condition is met outside the loop.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that:
1. `left` is still less than `len(s)`.
2. `s[left]` is not `'1'`.

Since `left` is currently 1, we need to ensure that:
- `len(s)` is greater than 1 (so `left < len(s)` holds true).
- `s[1]` is not `'1'`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `s[1]` is not `'1'`.

State: **`right` is the smallest index such that `right >= len(s)` or `s[right] == '0'`, `left` is 1, `s[1]` is not `'1'`, `s` and `cost` remain unchanged unless the swap condition is met outside the loop.**
