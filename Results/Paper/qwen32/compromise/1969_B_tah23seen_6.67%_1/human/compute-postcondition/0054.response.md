To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```python
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `right < len(s)`
2. `s[right] != '0'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `right` is a valid index such that `s[right + 1]` is not '0'.

Let's analyze what needs to be adjusted:

1. **Condition `right < len(s)`**: 
   - Since `right` is a valid index, it must already satisfy `right < len(s)`. No adjustment is needed here.

2. **Condition `s[right] != '0'`**:
   - The problem states that `s[right + 1]` is not '0', but this doesn't directly help us with `s[right]`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `s[right]` must not be '0'. 

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not provide information about the value of `s[right]`, we need to ensure that `s[right]` is explicitly set to a value that is not '0'.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `s[right]` is not '0'.

State: **`right` is a valid index such that `s[right + 1]` is not '0' and `s[right]` is not '0'**
