To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1**: `left < len(s)`
   - This condition ensures that the index `left` is within the bounds of the string `s`.

2. **Condition 2**: `s[left] != '1'`
   - This condition ensures that the character at index `left` in the string `s` is not '1'.

### Given State:
- `right` is the smallest index such that `right >= len(s)` or `s[right] == '0'`.
- `left` remains the same.
- `s` and `cost` remain unchanged unless the swap condition is met outside the loop.

### Required Adjustments:
- **Adjusting `left`**:
  - To satisfy `left < len(s)`, `left` must be a valid index within the string `s`. Therefore, `left` should be set to a value between `0` and `len(s) - 1`.
  - To satisfy `s[left] != '1'`, the character at index `left` in `s` should not be '1'. We need to ensure that `s[left]` is some character other than '1'.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `left` needs to be adjusted to a valid index where the character is not '1'.
- Since `right` is already defined as the smallest index such that `right >= len(s)` or `s[right] == '0'`, we can infer that there might be a '0' in the string `s` at index `right`. However, we need to ensure `left` points to a character that is not '1'.

### Final State:
- We can set `left` to `0` (assuming `s` is non-empty and `s[0]` is not '1'). If `s[0]` is '1', we need to find the next index where `s[left]` is not '1'.

Given the constraints and without knowing the exact content of `s`, let's assume the simplest case where `s[0]` is not '1':

State: **`right` is the smallest index such that `right >= len(s)` or `s[right] == '0'`, `left` is 0, `s` and `cost` remain unchanged unless the swap condition is met outside the loop**

If `s[0]` could potentially be '1', we need to ensure `left` points to the next character that is not '1'. However, based on the given information and assuming the simplest scenario:

State: **`right` is the smallest index such that `right >= len(s)` or `s[right] == '0'`, `left` is 0, `s` and `cost` remain unchanged unless the swap condition is met outside the loop**

If `s[0]` is '1', we would need more specific information about `s` to determine the correct `left` value. For now, assuming `s[0]` is not '1':

State: **`right` is the smallest index such that `right >= len(s)` or `s[right] == '0'`, `left` is 0, `s` and `cost` remain unchanged unless the swap condition is met outside the loop**
