To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```
while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
```

Let's break down each condition:

1. `left <= right`: 
   - Initially, `left` is 0 and `right` is 1. This condition is already satisfied.

2. `right < len(s)`:
   - `right` is 1. For this condition to be true, `len(s)` must be greater than 1.

3. `left < len(s)`:
   - `left` is 0. For this condition to be true, `len(s)` must be greater than 0. Since `right < len(s)` already ensures `len(s) > 1`, this condition is automatically satisfied.

From the above analysis, the only condition that needs to be ensured is that `len(s) > 1`. Given that `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order, and `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` has a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `s` will have a length greater than 1 as long as `sChar` contains at least one string.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed beyond ensuring that `sChar` contains at least one string. Since the problem statement guarantees that `sChar` is a list of strings with specified properties, we can assume that `sChar` contains at least one string, making `len(s) > 1`.

Thus, the state remains unchanged except for the implicit requirement that `sChar` contains at least one string.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order; `left` is 0; `cost` is 0; `right` is 1.**
