You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a list of strings where each string s consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string s satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in sChar does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: `s` is sorted with all '0's before all '1's, `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '1' exists, `right` is the length of `s` if no '0' exists, and `cost` is the total accumulated cost of swaps.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total accumulated cost of swaps, which is represented by the variable `cost`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `sChar`, which is a list of strings where each string consists only of '0's and '1's, and the length of each string is between 2 and 2 * 10^5. The total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function calculates and returns the total accumulated cost of swaps needed to achieve a specific configuration of '0's and '1's in the strings.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total accumulated cost of swaps, which is represented by the variable `cost`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
