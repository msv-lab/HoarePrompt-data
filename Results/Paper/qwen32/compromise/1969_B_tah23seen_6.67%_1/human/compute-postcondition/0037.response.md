The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `right` is initially `left + 1`. After the increment, `right` becomes `left + 2`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`; `right` is `left + 2`; `s[right]` is '1'; `s` must have at least two characters starting from the first '1'**.
