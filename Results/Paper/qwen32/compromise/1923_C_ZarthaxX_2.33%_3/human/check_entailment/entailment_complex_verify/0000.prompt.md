You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. c is a list of n integers where each integer c_i is such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]

        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: - `ones[i]` will hold the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list up to the `i-1` index.
    #   - `sum[i]` will hold the cumulative sum of `nums` list up to the `i-1` index, with each element decreased by 1.

    #Let's formalize this understanding in the output state format:
    #
    #Output State:
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `ones[i]` will hold the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list up to the `i-1` index. `sum[i]` will hold the cumulative sum of `nums` list up to the `i-1` index, with each element decreased by 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, the function determines if a specific condition is met within the sublist `c[l_i-1:r_i]` and prints 'YES' if the condition is satisfied, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining if a subarray is "good" is flawed.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `sumInRange` and `onesInRange`:**
   - The variable `sum` is used to store cumulative sums with a specific adjustment (`nums[i - 1] - 1`). This adjustment is not justified based on the problem requirements.
   - The logic for `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` does not correctly reflect the conditions for a "good" subarray.

2. **Incorrect Condition for "Good" Subarray:**
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is not derived from the problem's requirements and does not accurately check if the subarray can have a corresponding array `b` that meets the conditions.
   - Specifically, the condition does not ensure that `a_i != b_i` for every index `i` and that `b_i > 0`.

### Counterexample:

Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 1
2 3 4
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
- The subarray is `[2, 3, 4]`.
- A possible array `b` could be `[1, 2, 3]` which satisfies:
  - \(\sum a_i = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9\)
  - \(\sum b_i = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)
  - Adjust `b` to `[1, 2, 5]` to make \(\sum b_i = 8\) and then adjust further to `[1, 3, 5]` to make \(\sum b_i = 9\)
  - \(a_i \neq b_i\) for every index `i`
  - \(b_i > 0\) for every index `i`

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly determines that the subarray `[2, 3, 4]` is not "good" because of the flawed logic in the condition check.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. The condition used to determine if a subarray is "good" is incorrect and does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
