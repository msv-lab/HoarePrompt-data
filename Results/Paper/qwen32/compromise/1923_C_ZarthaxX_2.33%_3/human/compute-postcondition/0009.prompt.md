You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. c is a list of n integers where each integer c_i is such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: - `ones[i]` will hold the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list up to the `i-1` index.
    #   - `sum[i]` will hold the cumulative sum of `nums` list up to the `i-1` index, with each element decreased by 1.
    #
    #Let's formalize this understanding in the output state format:
    #
    #Output State:
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `ones[i]` will hold the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list up to the `i-1` index. `sum[i]` will hold the cumulative sum of `nums` list up to the `i-1` index, with each element decreased by 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function processes these queries and returns the result for each query.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
