You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    xxxxy
    
    co

    mwistht

    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the last input string, `a` is a set of unique characters from the last input string, `b` is the last input string sorted in ascending order, `c` is the last input string sorted in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if all characters are the same. If they are, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES' and then prints the string in sorted order, either ascending or descending, depending on whether the original string is already in ascending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Rearrange the characters of `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`, or report that it's impossible.
- Multiple answers are possible if there are several valid rearrangements.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads a string `s`. It then checks if all characters in the string are the same by converting the string to a set and checking its length. If the length of the set is 1, it means all characters are the same, and it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and provides a rearranged string.

The rearrangement strategy is to sort the string in ascending and descending order and print the one that is not equal to the original string.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Sorting Strategy**: The program uses sorting to create a rearranged string. However, it does not guarantee that the rearranged string is different from the original string in all cases. For example, consider the string "aabbaa". Sorting it in ascending order gives "aabbaa" again, which is the same as the original string.

### Example Case:
Let's consider the string "aabbaa":
- Original string: "aabbaa"
- Sorted in ascending order: "aabbaa" (same as original)
- Sorted in descending order: "bbaaaa" (different from original)

In this case, the program correctly identifies that a rearrangement is possible and prints "YES" followed by "bbaaaa".

However, let's consider another case:
- Original string: "abcabc"
- Sorted in ascending order: "aabbcc" (different from original)
- Sorted in descending order: "ccbaab" (different from original)

In this case, the program will print "YES" followed by "aabbcc" or "ccbaab", both of which are correct.

### Conclusion:
The program handles cases where all characters are the same correctly by printing "NO". However, it does not handle all cases where a rearrangement is possible correctly because it relies solely on sorting, which might not always produce a different string.

### Incorrect Case:
Consider the string "aaaabbbb":
- Original string: "aaaabbbb"
- Sorted in ascending order: "aaaabbbb" (same as original)
- Sorted in descending order: "bbbbaaaa" (different from original)

In this case, the program will print "YES" followed by "bbbbaaaa", which is correct. However, the program does not handle cases where sorting in ascending order does not produce a different string correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not handle all cases where a rearrangement is possible correctly. Specifically, when the sorted version of the string in ascending order is the same as the original string, the program should still be able to provide a different rearrangement. The current implementation does not guarantee this for all possible inputs.
