You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if all characters are the same. If they are, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES' and then prints the string in sorted order, either ascending or descending, depending on whether the original string is already in ascending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to rearrange the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` such that `r` is not equal to `s`. If such a rearrangement is not possible, the program should output "NO". Otherwise, it should output "YES" followed by one possible rearrangement.

### Key Points:
1. **Single Character Strings:** If the string `s` consists of only one character, any rearrangement will be the same as the original string. Hence, the output should be "NO".
2. **Strings with Multiple Characters:** If the string `s` has more than one unique character, it's always possible to rearrange the characters to form a new string `r` that is different from `s`. 

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. **Input Reading:** It reads the number of test cases `n` and then for each test case, it reads the string `s`.
2. **Set Creation:** It creates a set `a` from the characters of `s`. The length of this set indicates the number of unique characters in `s`.
3. **Single Character Check:** If the length of `a` is 1 (i.e., all characters in `s` are the same), it prints "NO".
4. **Multiple Character Case:** If the length of `a` is greater than 1, it prints "YES" and then attempts to find a rearrangement:
    - It sorts the string `s` in ascending order to get `b`.
    - It sorts the string `s` in descending order to get `c`.
    - It checks if the original string `s` is equal to the sorted version `b`. If it is, it prints the reverse sorted version `c`. Otherwise, it prints the sorted version `b`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Single Character Strings:** If `s` has only one unique character, the program correctly outputs "NO".
- **Multiple Character Strings:** The program correctly outputs "YES" and a rearranged string `r` that is different from `s`. Since it sorts the string in two different orders (ascending and descending), at least one of these will be different from the original string `s` unless all characters are the same.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly handles the requirements of the problem for all valid input cases.

Correctness: **True**
