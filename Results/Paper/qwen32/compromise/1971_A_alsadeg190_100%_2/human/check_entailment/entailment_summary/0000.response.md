Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly implements the problem's requirements. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, compares them, and prints the smaller integer followed by the larger integer. This matches the expected behavior as described in the problem statement and the example provided.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as intended, reading and processing each test case correctly and outputting the minimum and maximum values as required.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
