### Reasoning:

To determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them, we need to analyze the possible cuts and the resulting rectangles.

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - Bob can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically.
   - If he cuts horizontally, he divides the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of sizes `(a, x)` and `(a, b-x)` where `0 < x < b`.
   - If he cuts vertically, he divides the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of sizes `(x, b)` and `(a-x, b)` where `0 < x < a`.

2. **Forming Another Rectangle:**
   - After cutting, Bob can rearrange the two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.
   - For the new rectangle to be different from the original one, the dimensions of the new rectangle should not be the same as the original rectangle, even after accounting for 90-degree rotations.

3. **Key Observation:**
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
     - For example, if `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of sizes `(a/2, b)` and `(a/2, b)`. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `(a, b/2)`.
     - Similarly, if `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of sizes `(a, b/2)` and `(a, b/2)`. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `(a/2, b)`.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only possible cuts result in smaller rectangles of odd dimensions, and rearranging these will not form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it prints "Yes", indicating that another rectangle can be formed.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "No", indicating that another rectangle cannot be formed.

This logic aligns with the key observation made above.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the analysis.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
