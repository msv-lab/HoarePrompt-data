### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The key observation is that if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, then the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of integer dimensions, and these can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

Here's the detailed reasoning:
1. **Even Dimension Case**: If \(a\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\). Similarly, if \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\). In both cases, these smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
2. **Odd Dimension Case**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the rectangle can only be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \(\frac{a-1}{2} \times b\) and \(1 \times b\) (or \(a \times \frac{b-1}{2}\) and \(a \times 1\)). These smaller rectangles cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle because the only possible rectangles formed would be of dimensions \(a \times b\) (after rotating and rearranging), which is the same as the original rectangle.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines if it is possible to form a different rectangle based on the given conditions.
