You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and for each test case, the program prints 'Yes' if at least one of the integers `a` or `b` is even, otherwise it prints 'No'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them, we need to analyze the possible cuts and the resulting rectangles.

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - Bob can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically.
   - If he cuts horizontally, he divides the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of sizes `(a, x)` and `(a, b-x)` where `0 < x < b`.
   - If he cuts vertically, he divides the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of sizes `(x, b)` and `(a-x, b)` where `0 < x < a`.

2. **Forming Another Rectangle:**
   - After cutting, Bob can rearrange the two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.
   - For the new rectangle to be different from the original one, the dimensions of the new rectangle should not be the same as the original rectangle, even after accounting for 90-degree rotations.

3. **Key Observation:**
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
     - For example, if `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of sizes `(a/2, b)` and `(a/2, b)`. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `(a, b/2)`.
     - Similarly, if `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of sizes `(a, b/2)` and `(a, b/2)`. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `(a/2, b)`.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only possible cuts result in smaller rectangles of odd dimensions, and rearranging these will not form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it prints "Yes", indicating that another rectangle can be formed.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "No", indicating that another rectangle cannot be formed.

This logic aligns with the key observation made above.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the analysis.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
