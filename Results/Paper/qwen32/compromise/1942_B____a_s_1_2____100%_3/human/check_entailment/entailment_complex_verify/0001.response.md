### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each element `a_i` in the given array `a`, the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` holds.
- `MEX` of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to construct the permutation `p` by iterating from the end of the array `a` to the beginning. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `p` is initialized as an array of `-1` of length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`. This is a reasonable starting point because `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not in the constructed part of `p`.

2. **Iterating Backwards**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = n-1` to `i = 0`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.

#### Correctness Verification:
- The key idea here is to ensure that `mex` correctly represents the smallest non-negative integer not in the constructed part of `p` at each step.
- By iterating backwards, the code ensures that when calculating `p[i]`, `mex` is already the smallest non-negative integer not in `p[i+1]` to `p[n-1]`.
- The update of `mex` ensures that it remains valid for the next iteration.

#### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` which matches the expected output.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` which matches the expected output.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `p = [2, 0, 1]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [2, 0, 1]` which matches the expected output.

#### Challenges to the Original Assessment:
- The key aspect to verify is whether the `mex` is correctly maintained and whether the constructed `p` meets the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- The annotated code and the original assessment seem to correctly reason about the logic and provide accurate calculations for the examples given.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for the given array `a` based on the problem description. The annotations and calculations provided in the original assessment are accurate, and the examples verify the correctness of the implementation.

Final: **True**
