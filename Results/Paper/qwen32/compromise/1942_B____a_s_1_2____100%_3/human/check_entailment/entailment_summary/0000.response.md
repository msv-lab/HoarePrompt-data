### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to construct a permutation `p` based on the array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program iterates through the array `a` in reverse order and calculates each element of `p` as `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the minimum non-negative integer not yet used in `p`. The `mex` is updated to the minimum value between the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]` to ensure that `mex` remains the smallest unused integer.

However, the logic in the program is flawed. The `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in `p` up to that point. The current implementation updates `mex` based on the value of `p[i]` after it has been calculated, which does not guarantee that `mex` is the smallest unused integer for the next iteration.

Let's consider the first test case from the example:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
- The program calculates `p` as `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` by iterating in reverse and using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.

Upon closer inspection:
- For `i = 4`, `mex = 5`, `a[4] = 2`, so `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`. Now, `mex` should be updated to the smallest unused integer, which is `0`.
- For `i = 3`, `mex = 0`, `a[3] = 1`, so `p[3] = 0 - 1 = -1`. This is incorrect because `-1` is not a valid value for `p` and `mex` should be adjusted to `1` after `p[4]` was set to `3`.
- The program's logic fails to correctly maintain the `mex` value for each step, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the permutation `p` for all valid inputs, as demonstrated by the flawed logic in maintaining the `mex` value.
