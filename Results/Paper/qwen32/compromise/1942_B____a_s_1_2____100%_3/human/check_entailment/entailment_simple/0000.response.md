Reasoning: 

The given program attempts to construct a permutation `p` based on the array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order, starting with `mex` initialized to `n`, and calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`. After each calculation, it updates `mex` to be the minimum value between the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

However, there is a flaw in this approach. The program does not ensure that the values assigned to `p` are unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`, which is a requirement for `p` to be a valid permutation. The reverse iteration and the way `mex` is updated can lead to incorrect values for `p`, especially when the values in `a` are negative or large.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to construct `p` in a way that ensures all elements of `p` are unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`. A correct approach would involve maintaining a set of available numbers (from `0` to `n-1`) and assigning the smallest available number to `p[i]` based on the value of `a[i]`.

Given the provided program does not handle these constraints properly, it is likely to produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
