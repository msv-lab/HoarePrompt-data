The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` is now the integer inputted by the user, and it replaces the previous value of `n`. The other variables, `t`, `a`, `p`, and `mex`, are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where `p[i] = n - a[i]` for each `i`; `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`. The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.**
