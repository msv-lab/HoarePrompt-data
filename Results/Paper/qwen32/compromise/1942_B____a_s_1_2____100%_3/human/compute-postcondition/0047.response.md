Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of `n` elements where each element `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` after the loop completes; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` across all iterations of the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- The variable `n` remains the same, indicating the number of elements in the list `a`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged as it was obtained from the input.
- The list `p` is fully populated where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` starting from the last element to the first.
- The variable `mex` holds the smallest value encountered during the computation of `mex - a[i]` throughout all iterations of the loop.
