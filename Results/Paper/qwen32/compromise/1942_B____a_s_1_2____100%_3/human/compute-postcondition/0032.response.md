To determine what will be printed by the `print(*p)` statement, we need to carefully understand the given initial state and the computations involved.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 1\).
3. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
4. `p` is a list where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
5. `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `a`.

### Steps to Compute `p`:
1. **Determine `mex`:**
   - `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the list `a`.
   - For example, if `a = [0, 1, 3]`, then `mex = 2` because 2 is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `a`.

2. **Compute `p`:**
   - For each element `a[i]` in the list `a`, compute `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - For example, if `a = [0, 1, 3]` and `mex = 2`, then:
     - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 2 - 0 = 2`
     - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`
     - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 2 - 3 = -1`
   - Therefore, `p = [2, 1, -1]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

### Description of Output:
- `p` is a list where each element is computed as `mex - a[i]` for each \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
- The exact numerical values of `p` depend on the specific values of `a` and the computed `mex`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **p (where p is a list of integers computed as mex - a[i] for each i from 0 to n-1)**

This description is precise and adheres to the format specified, providing a clear understanding of what will be printed based on the initial state.
