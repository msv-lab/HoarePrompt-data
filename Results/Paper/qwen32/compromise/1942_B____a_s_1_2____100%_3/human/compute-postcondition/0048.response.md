To determine what will be printed by the `print(*p)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the transformation that each variable undergoes.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p` is a list of `n` elements where each element `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` after the loop completes.
- `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` across all iterations of the loop.

### Key Points to Understand:
1. **`a` List**: This is a list of integers provided as input.
2. **`mex` Calculation**: `mex` is calculated such that it is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`. This is a common problem in competitive programming and is often referred to as the "minimum excluded value" or "mex".
3. **`p` List Construction**: Each element `p[i]` in the list `p` is computed as `mex - a[i]`. This means that `p` is a transformation of the list `a` based on the `mex` value.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Determine `mex`**:
   - `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the list `a`.
   - For example, if `a = [0, 1, 3]`, then `mex = 2` because 2 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list.
2. **Construct `p`**:
   - For each element `a[i]` in `a`, compute `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
   - This means that `p` is a list where each element is the difference between `mex` and the corresponding element in `a`.

### Example Calculation:
Given `a = [0, 1, 3]`:
- `mex = 2` (since 2 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list).
- `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 2 - 0 = 2`
- `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`
- `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 2 - 3 = -1`
- Therefore, `p = [2, 1, -1]`.

### General Case:
For any list `a`, the value of `mex` is determined by the smallest non-negative integer not in `a`. Each element `p[i]` in `p` is then calculated as `mex - a[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p`, where each element is computed as `mex - a[i]`.

### Final Output:
Output: **p (where p is a list of n elements where each element p[i] is mex - a[i], and mex is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list a)**
