The code snippet provided assigns the value of `n` to the variable `mex`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times; `mex` is `n`.**
