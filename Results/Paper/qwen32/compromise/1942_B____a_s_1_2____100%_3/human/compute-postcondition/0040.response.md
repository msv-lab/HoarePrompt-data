The code snippet `mex = min(mex, p[i])` updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `p[i]`. Given that `mex` was initially `n` and `p[i]` is `n - a[i]`, the new value of `mex` will be the smaller of `n` and `n - a[i]`.

Since `a[i]` is an integer from the list `a` and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n - a[i]` could be less than, equal to, or greater than `n`. However, because `a[i]` is an integer, `n - a[i]` will be at most `n` (when `a[i]` is 0) and at least `n - (maximum value in `a`)`. Therefore, `mex` will be updated to `n - a[i]` if `n - a[i]` is smaller than `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`.**
