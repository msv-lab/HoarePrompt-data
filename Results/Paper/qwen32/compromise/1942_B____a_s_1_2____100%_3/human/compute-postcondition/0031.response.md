Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; the loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop complete, the variable `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 10,000. The variable `n` remains the same integer value representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is unchanged and contains the input integers. The list `p` is fully populated such that each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` for all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `mex` is updated to be the smallest value of `mex - a[i]` across all iterations. The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1, indicating the loop has finished executing all iterations.
