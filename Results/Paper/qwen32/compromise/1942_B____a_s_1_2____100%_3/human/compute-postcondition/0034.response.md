The provided code snippet only contains the line `n = int(input())`. This line reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is already an integer such that `n >= 1`. The execution of this line will override the previous value of `n` with the new input value.

All other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, `mex`, and the loop variable `_`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; the loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.**
