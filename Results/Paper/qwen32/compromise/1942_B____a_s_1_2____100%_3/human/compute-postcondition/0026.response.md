The code snippet `p[i] = mex - a[i]` updates the `i`-th element of the list `p` to be the value of `mex - a[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, `p[0]` will be updated to `mex - a[0]`.

The value of `mex` is defined as `min(n, n - a[i])`. Since `i` is 0, `mex` becomes `min(n, n - a[0])`.

Therefore, `p[0]` will be `min(n, n - a[0]) - a[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the 0-th element is `min(n, n - a[0]) - a[0]` and all other elements are -1; `mex` is `min(n, n - a[0])`; `i` is 0**.
