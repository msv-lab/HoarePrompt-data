The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters (`n - 1`, `-1`, `-1`). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range `(n - 1, -1, -1)` will generate at least one value (which is `n - 1`) if `n` is greater than 0.

The state of `t`, `a`, and `p` does not affect the execution of the loop, and `mex` is also not directly related to the loop's execution in terms of the loop head.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to `n - 1` according to the range, so it does not need to be set manually before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `-1`; `mex` is `n`**
