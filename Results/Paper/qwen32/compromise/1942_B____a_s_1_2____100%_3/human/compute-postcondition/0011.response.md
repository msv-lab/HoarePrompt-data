The code snippet `mex = min(mex, p[i])` updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Given the initial conditions, `mex` is initially set to the minimum of `n` and `p[i]`. After executing the code, `mex` will be the minimum of its previous value and `p[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list where `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is the minimum of the previous `mex` and `p[i]`, `i` is 1.**
