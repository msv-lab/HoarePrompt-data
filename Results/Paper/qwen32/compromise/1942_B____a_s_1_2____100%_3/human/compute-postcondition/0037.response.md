The value of `mex` is explicitly set to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `-1`; `mex` is `n`; the loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.**
