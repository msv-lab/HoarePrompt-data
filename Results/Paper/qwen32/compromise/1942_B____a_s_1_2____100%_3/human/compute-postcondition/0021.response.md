The value of `mex` is reassigned to be equal to `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `p`, and the loop variable `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of -1's with length `n`; `mex` is `n`; the loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.**
