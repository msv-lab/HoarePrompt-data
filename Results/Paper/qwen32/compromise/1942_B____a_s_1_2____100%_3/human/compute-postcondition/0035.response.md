The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `a` by reading a new input string, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and then storing these integers in the list `a`. 

Since the input `n` (the number of integers) and the original list `a` are not used in this code snippet, their values remain unchanged. The loop variable `_` being incremented by 1 is also not affected by this code snippet as it is not mentioned in the provided code.

The output state is that `a` is now a new list of integers obtained from the input, while `n`, `p`, `mex`, and `t` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; the loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.**
