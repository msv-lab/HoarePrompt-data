The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a conventional variable name for a loop counter that we don't plan to use) and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is typically not something we need to set before the loop starts, as it is initialized within the loop. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment is actually needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

However, if we strictly adhere to the requirement to adjust states of objects in the loop head and ensure the loop executes, we can confirm that `t` is already in a valid state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
