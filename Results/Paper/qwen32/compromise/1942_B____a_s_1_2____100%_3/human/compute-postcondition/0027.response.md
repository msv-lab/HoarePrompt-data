The code snippet `mex = min(mex, p[i])` will update the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `p[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, `p[i]` is `p[0]`, which is `min(n, n - a[0]) - a[0]`.

Since `mex` is initially set to `min(n, n - a[0])`, the new value of `mex` will be the minimum of `min(n, n - a[0])` and `min(n, n - a[0]) - a[0]`. 

Because `min(n, n - a[0]) - a[0]` is always less than or equal to `min(n, n - a[0])` (since subtracting a non-negative number from a non-negative number results in a non-negative number that is less than or equal to the original), the new value of `mex` will be `min(n, n - a[0]) - a[0]`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the 0-th element is `min(n, n - a[0]) - a[0]` and all other elements are -1; `mex` is `min(n, n - a[0]) - a[0]`; `i` is 0**.
