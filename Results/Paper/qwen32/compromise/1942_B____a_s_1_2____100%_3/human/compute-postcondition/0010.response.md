The code snippet updates the value of `p[i]` based on the new formula `mex - a[i]`. Given the initial state, `p[i]` was previously defined as `n - a[i]`. Now, `p[i]` is recalculated to be `mex - a[i]`.

Since `mex` is defined as the minimum of `n` and any `p[i]`, and `p[i]` is being recalculated, we need to consider the new value of `p[i]` after the assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list where `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `p[i]`, `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `p[i]` has been updated to `mex - a[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values or definitions.
