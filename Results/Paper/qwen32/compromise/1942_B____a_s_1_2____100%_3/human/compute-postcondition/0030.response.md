Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the 0-th element is `min(n, n - a[0]) - a[0]` and the 1-st element is `mex - a[1]`, and all other elements are -1; `mex` is `min(mex, p[i])`; `i` is 1**.

Natural Language: The value of `mex` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value of `p[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
