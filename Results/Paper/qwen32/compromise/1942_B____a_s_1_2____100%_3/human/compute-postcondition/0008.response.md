The code snippet `mex = min(mex, p[i])` updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `p` is a list where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]`
- `mex` is `n`

After executing `mex = min(mex, p[i])`:
- The value of `mex` will be the smaller value between its current value (`n`) and `p[i]`.

Since `p[i]` is defined as `n - a[i]`, and `a[i]` is an integer from the list `a`, `p[i]` will be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `mex` will be updated to `p[i]` if `p[i]` is less than `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `p[i]`.**
