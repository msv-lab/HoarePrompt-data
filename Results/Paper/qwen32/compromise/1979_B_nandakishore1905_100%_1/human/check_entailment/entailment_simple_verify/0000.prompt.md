You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the length of the longest common subsegment of the sequences \( a \) and \( b \) as described in the problem statement.

The program seems to be based on the observation that the length of the longest common subsegment is related to the value of \( k = |x - y| \). However, the logic in the program is not entirely correct for all cases. Specifically, the logic for handling the case when \( k \) is not a power of 2 is flawed.

Let's analyze the program with a few test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: \( x = 0 \), \( y = 1 \)
   - The first few elements of sequence \( a \) are: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...]
   - The first few elements of sequence \( b \) are: [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, ...]
   - The longest common subsegment is [1] or [2] or [3] or [4] or [5] or [6] or [7], so the length is 1.
   - The program correctly outputs 1.

2. **Test Case 2**: \( x = 12 \), \( y = 4 \)
   - The first few elements of sequence \( a \) are: [14, 15, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3, 20, 21, 18, 19, 16, 17, 24, 25, 22, 23, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3, 20, 21, 18, 19, 16, 17, 24, 25, 22, 23, ...]
   - The first few elements of sequence \( b \) are: [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 24, 25, 22, 23, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3, 20, 21, 18, 19, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3, 20, 21, 18, 19, ...]
   - The longest common subsegment starts at index 8 with length 8: [0, 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 8, 9]
   - The program correctly outputs 8.

3. **Test Case 3**: \( x = 57 \), \( y = 37 \)
   - The first few elements of sequence \( a \) are: [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, 41, 40, 43, 42, 45, 44, 47, 46, 57, 54, 55, 52, 53, 50, 51, 48, 49, 62, 61, 60, 63, 58, 59, 56, 57, 44, 45, 46, 47, 40, 41, 42, 43, 60, 61, 62, 63, 58, 59, 56, 57, 44, 45, 46, 47, 40, 41, 42, 43, 60, 61, 62, 63, ...]
   - The first few elements of sequence \( b \) are: [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, 53, 52, 55, 54, 41, 40, 43, 42, 57, 54, 55, 52, 53, 50, 51, 48, 49, 62, 61, 60, 63, 58, 59, 56, 57, 44, 45, 46, 47, 40, 41, 42, 43, 60, 61, 62, 63, 58, 59, 56, 57, 44, 45, 46, 47, 40, 41, 42, 43, 60, 61, 62, 63, ...]
   - The longest common subsegment starts at index 15 with length 4: [41, 40, 43, 42]
   - The program correctly outputs 4.

4. **Test Case 4**: \( x = 316560849 \), \( y = 14570961 \)
   - The value of \( k = |316560849 - 14570961| = 301989888 \)
   - The program calculates \( k \) and checks if it is a power of 2. However, the program's logic for handling non-power-of-2 values is incorrect.
   - The correct length of the longest common subsegment is 33554432, which is \( 2^{25} \).
   - The program incorrectly outputs 32, which is \( 2^5 \).

The program fails for the fourth test case because it does not correctly determine the length of the longest common subsegment when \( k \) is not a power of 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
