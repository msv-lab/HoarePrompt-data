You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves two infinite sequences defined as:
- \( a_n = n \oplus x \)
- \( b_n = n \oplus y \)

The task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment of these two sequences.

### Key Insight
A key insight is that \( a_i = b_j \) if and only if \( i \oplus x = j \oplus y \), which simplifies to \( i \oplus j = x \oplus y \). Let's denote \( k = x \oplus y \). The problem reduces to finding the longest subsegment where \( i \oplus j = k \).

### Observations
1. **If \( k \) is a power of 2:** The longest common subsegment is of length \( k \).
2. **If \( k \) is odd:** The longest common subsegment is of length 1.
3. **If \( k \) is even and not a power of 2:** The longest common subsegment is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \).

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to implement this logic with the following steps:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the integers \( x \) and \( y \).
3. Compute \( k = |x - y| \).
4. Check if \( k \) is a power of 2 using the condition \( k \& (k - 1) == 0 \).
5. If \( k \) is odd, print 1.
6. Otherwise, find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) and print it.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Calculation of \( k \):** The program calculates \( k \) as \( |x - y| \) instead of \( x \oplus y \). This is a critical error because the problem requires the XOR operation, not the absolute difference.
2. **Handling Even \( k \):** The logic for handling even \( k \) that are not powers of 2 is unnecessarily complex and incorrect. It attempts to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) but does so in a convoluted manner.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
