Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
- For each of the `t` test cases, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \( 0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9 \).
- `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input.
- `k` is 8.
- `k` is even and not a power of 2 (this is redundant because 8 is a power of 2, but we'll proceed with the given information).
- `l` is '11'.
- `p` is 2.
- `q` is 2.
- `f` is 1.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(f)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(f)` statement will print the value of the variable `f`. According to the initial state, the variable `f` is explicitly given the value 1.

### Output:
Output: **1**
