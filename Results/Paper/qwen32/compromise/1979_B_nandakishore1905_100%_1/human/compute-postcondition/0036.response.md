The `print(1)` statement in the given code snippet will simply print the integer `1`. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` do not affect the output of this particular print statement because the statement is hardcoded to print the number `1`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:
1. The variable `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. The variable `i` is the current iteration number + 1.
3. The variable `n` is the first integer from the input.
4. The variable `m` is the second integer from the input.
5. The variable `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

None of these variables are used in the `print(1)` statement, so their specific values do not influence the output.

Output: **1**
