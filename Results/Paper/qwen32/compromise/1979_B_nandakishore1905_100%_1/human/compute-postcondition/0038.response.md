The code snippet `p = len(l)` calculates the length of the string `l`, which is the binary representation of `k` (the absolute difference between `n` and `m`). This means `p` will hold the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `p`. The value of `p` is directly dependent on the value of `l`, which in turn depends on the values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.**
