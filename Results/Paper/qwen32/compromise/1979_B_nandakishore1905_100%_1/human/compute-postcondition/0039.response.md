The code snippet assigns `q` the value of `2` raised to the power of `p - 1`. Given that `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k` (the absolute difference between `n` and `m`), the value of `q` is calculated based on this length.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`.**
