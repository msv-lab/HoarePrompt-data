The value of `f` is assigned the result of `k - q`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`, `f` is `k - q`.**
