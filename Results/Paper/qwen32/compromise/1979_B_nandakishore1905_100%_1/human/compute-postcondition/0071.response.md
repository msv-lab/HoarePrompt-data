Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 2, `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `f` is not a power of two**

Explanation: The variable `p` is reassigned to the length of the string `l`, which is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix. All other variables remain unchanged.
