Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. All other variables retain their initial states as described.
