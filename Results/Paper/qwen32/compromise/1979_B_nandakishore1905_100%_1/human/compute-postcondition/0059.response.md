Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 1, `n` and `m` are integers, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of two, the state remains as described. If `k` is not a power of two, `l` is the binary representation of `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix and has exactly one '1' bit, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1` and is equal to `f`, and `f` is a power of two. If `k` is odd, the state remains as described.**

To clarify, the postcondition describes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. If `k` is a power of two, no additional variables like `l`, `p`, or `q` are introduced. If `k` is not a power of two, these variables are defined as specified, and `f` is a power of two. If `k` is odd, no changes are made beyond the iteration number `i` being incremented.
