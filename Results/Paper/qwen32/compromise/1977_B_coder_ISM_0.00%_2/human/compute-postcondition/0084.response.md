The value of `x` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `length`, `flag`, and `nalla`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with either 30 elements where no consecutive elements are `'1'` or 31 elements where the 31st element is `'1'` and no other consecutive elements are `'1'`, `length` is either 30 or 31, and `flag` is either 0 or not 0, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`**.
