Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or `'0'` for the first 30 elements. If the 30th bit of `x` is set, `s` contains an additional `'1'` at the end. Otherwise, `s` contains an additional `'0'` at the end. `i` is 30.**
