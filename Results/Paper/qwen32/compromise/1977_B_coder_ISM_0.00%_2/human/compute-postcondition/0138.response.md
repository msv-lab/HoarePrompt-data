Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is either '1', '0', or '-1', `length` remains 30, `nalla` remains unchanged, `i` is 2. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[2]` was '0', then `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged. If `flag` was 0 and `s[2]` and `s[3]` were both '1', then `flag` remains 0; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.**
