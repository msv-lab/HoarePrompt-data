Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is 1, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list of 30 strings, each either `'1'` or `'0'`. The `i`-th element of `s` is `'1'` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, otherwise it is `'0'`. `i` is 0. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not `'1'`.**
