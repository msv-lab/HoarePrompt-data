Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is either '1', '0', or '-1' depending on the initial conditions. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then `s` is modified such that the second string is '1' and the rest are either '1', '0', or '-1', `length` remains 30, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `i` is 1, and `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, `s`, `length`, `nalla`, `i`, and `flag` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions.**
