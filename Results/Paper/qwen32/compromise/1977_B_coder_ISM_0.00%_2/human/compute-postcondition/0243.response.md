Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `flag` is 0 if `s[29]` is `'0'` or if the else part is taken, otherwise `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'1'`, `s` is a list of 30 strings where if `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i-1]` is set to `'-1'` and all other `s[k]` for `k != i-1` are `'0'` unless `s[j] == '-1'` and `s[j - 1] == '1'` for `j != i`, in which case `s[j-1]` is `'-1'` and all other `s[k]` for `k != i-1` and `k != j` are `'0'`. `length` is at least 2, `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i-1]` is set to `'-1'` and all other `s[k]` for `k != i-1` are `'0'`, otherwise `s` remains unchanged.**
