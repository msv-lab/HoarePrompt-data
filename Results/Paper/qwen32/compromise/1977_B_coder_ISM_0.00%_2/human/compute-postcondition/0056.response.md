Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 2. If `flag` is 0 and `s[2]` is `'1'` and `s[3]` is `'1'`, then `s[2]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1 and `s[2]` was originally `'0'`, then `s[2]` is set to `'1'` and `flag` remains 1. In all other cases, the state of `s` and `flag` remains as described in the precondition.**
