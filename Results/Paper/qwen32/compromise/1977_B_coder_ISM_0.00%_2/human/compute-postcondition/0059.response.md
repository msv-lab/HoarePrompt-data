Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 30 elements where no consecutive elements are `'1'` except `s[29]` which is now `'1'`, `length` is 30, `flag` is 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `s[29]` has been changed to `'1'`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
