Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the string '0', `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or not 0, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`. The `i`-th bit of `x` is 0.**

Natural Language: The list `s` now contains the string '0'. All other variables retain their initial values.
