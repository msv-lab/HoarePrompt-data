Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `nalla` is `t` (indicating all test cases have been processed), `x` is the input integer from the last test case, `s` is a list of 30 or 31 strings with no consecutive `'1'` and `'-1'` pairs, `length` is 30 or 31 based on the value of `flag` from the last test case, and `flag` is 0 or 1 based on the last test case's processing.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, all `t` test cases have been processed. The variable `nalla` will have the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has run for each test case. The variable `x` will hold the value of the input integer from the last test case. The list `s` will contain either 30 or 31 elements, with no consecutive `'1'` and `'-1'` pairs. The `length` variable will be either 30 or 31, reflecting the number of elements in `s`. Finally, `flag` will be either 0 or 1, reflecting the state at the end of processing the last test case.
