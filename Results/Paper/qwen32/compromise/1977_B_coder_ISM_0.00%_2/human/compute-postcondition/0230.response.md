Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `flag` is 0 if `s[29]` is `'0'` or if the else part is taken, otherwise `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'1'`. `s` is a list of 30 strings where each `'1'` that was part of a consecutive pair of `'1'`s has been replaced by `'-1'`, the next `'0'` after such a pair has been replaced by `'1'`, and all other `'1'`s that are not part of such pairs remain `'1'`. If `flag` is not 0, the 31st string in `s` is `'1'` and `length` is 31, otherwise `length` is 30.**
