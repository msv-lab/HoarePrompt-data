Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each being either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not, and `length` is 30; `flag` is 1, `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is `'0'`.**
