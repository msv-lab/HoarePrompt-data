Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, and `s` is ['0']. Additionally, the `i`th bit of `x` is 0.**

The list `s` now contains a single element '0'. All other variables retain their initial values.
