Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list of 30 strings. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[1]` is `'0'`, then `flag` is now 0 and `s[0]` is `'0'`. If `flag` was initially 0 and `s[1] == s[2] == '1'`, then `s[1]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s[0]` is `'0'` if `flag` was 1, or `'1'` if the 0-th bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the 0-th bit of `x` is not set, and `s[1]` is `'0'` if `flag` was initially 1 and `s[1]` was `'0'`, otherwise `'1'`. If `flag` is initially 1 and `s[2]` is `'0'`, then `flag` becomes 0 and `s[2]` is set to `'1'`. If `flag` was 0 and `s[2] == s[3] == '1'`, then `s[2]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. All other `s[j]` for `j` from 3 to 29 remain either `'1'` or `'0'`.**
