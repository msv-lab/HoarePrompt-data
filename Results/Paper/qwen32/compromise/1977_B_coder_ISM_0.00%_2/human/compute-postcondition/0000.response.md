The code snippet reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10,000. After the execution of the code, `t` will hold the value of the integer input. The precondition about the range of `t` remains valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < 2^30.**
