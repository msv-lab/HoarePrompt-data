Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list of 30 strings, each either `'1'` or `'0'`. The `i`-th element of `s` is `'1'` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, otherwise it is `'0'`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all 30 iterations, the list `s` will contain 30 elements, where each element is either `'1'` or `'0'`. These elements represent the binary representation of the integer `x`, with the least significant bit (rightmost) at the beginning of the list and the most significant bit (leftmost) at the end. The other variables (`t`, `flag`, `nalla`, and `length`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
