Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings, each either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit (from 0 to 29) of `x` is set or not, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or not 0, and `nalla` is `nalla + 1`.**

In simple terms, after the loop completes all 30 iterations, the list `s` will contain 30 elements, each representing whether the corresponding bit (from the 0th to the 29th bit) of the integer `x` is set (1) or not set (0). The variables `t`, `length`, `flag`, and `nalla` remain unchanged except that `nalla` is incremented by 1.
