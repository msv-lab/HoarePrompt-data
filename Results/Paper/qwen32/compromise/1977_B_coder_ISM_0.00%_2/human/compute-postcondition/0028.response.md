Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each being either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not, except `s[0]` is `'1'` if `flag` was 0 and `s[0]` was originally `'0'`. `s[i]` is now `'-1'`. `flag` is 0, `i` is 0, `s[i + 1]` is `'1'`.**

In natural language: The value of `s[i]` has been changed to `'-1'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, except `s[0]` which might have been changed to `'1'` if `flag` was 0 and `s[0]` was originally `'0'`.
