### Reasoning:

The given program aims to find an integer `y` (where `1 â‰¤ y < x`) that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y`. The function `func_1(x)` iterates from `x-1` down to `2` and checks for the largest `y` that satisfies the condition `2 * y >= x` if `x % y == 0`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works and whether it correctly finds the optimal `y`:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `max_val` to `1`. This variable is intended to store the largest proper divisor of `x` that is less than `x/2` or `1` if `x` is a prime number.

2. **Loop**: The function iterates from `x-1` to `2` (inclusive) in descending order. For each `y`, it checks:
   - If `x % y == 0`, meaning `y` is a divisor of `x`.
   - If `2 * y >= x`, it immediately returns `y` because this condition ensures that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized. Since `gcd(x, y) = y` when `y` is a divisor, `gcd(x, y) + y` becomes `2 * y`, which is maximized when `2 * y` is as close to `x` as possible without exceeding it.
   - If `2 * y < x`, it updates `max_val` to `y` and continues the loop.

3. **Return**: If no `y` satisfies `2 * y >= x`, the function returns `max_val`, which is the largest proper divisor of `x` that is less than `x/2`, or `1` if `x` is a prime number.

### Analysis of the Example Outputs:

Let's verify the function with the provided example inputs:

- **Input**: `x = 10`
  - Divisors: `1, 2, 5, 10`
  - `y = 5` satisfies `2 * y = 10 >= x`, so it is returned.
  - Output: `5`

- **Input**: `x = 7`
  - Divisors: `1, 7`
  - No `y` satisfies `2 * y >= x`, so the largest proper divisor less than `x/2` is returned, which is `1`.
  - Output: `6` (Note: The given output is `6`, which is the second-largest proper divisor and actually maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` in this case, but the function as written would return `1`)

- **Input**: `x = 21`
  - Divisors: `1, 3, 7, 21`
  - `y = 18` is not a divisor, but `y = 18` is the second-largest number less than `21` and maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` in this case.
  - Output: `18` (Note: The given output is `18`, which is not a divisor but maximizes the expression. The function would need to be adjusted to handle this case correctly.)

- **Input**: `x = 100`
  - Divisors: `1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100`
  - `y = 98` is not a divisor, but `y = 98` maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` in this case.
  - Output: `98` (Note: The given output is `98`, which is not a divisor but maximizes the expression. The function would need to be adjusted to handle this case correctly.)

- **Input**: `x = 2`
  - Divisors: `1, 2`
  - No `y` satisfies `2 * y >= x`, so `1` is returned.
  - Output: `1` (Note: The given output is `750`, which is incorrect for `x = 2`.)

- **Input**: `x = 1000`
  - Divisors: `1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 1000`
  - `y = 750` is not a divisor, but `y = 750` maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` in this case.
  - Output: `750` (Note: The given output is `750`, which is not a divisor but maximizes the expression. The function would need to be adjusted to handle this case correctly.)

- **Input**: `x = 6`
  - Divisors: `1, 2, 3, 6`
  - `y = 3` satisfies `2 * y = 6 >= x`, so it is returned.
  - Output: `3`

### Conclusion:

The function as written does not guarantee that it will always return the correct `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for all inputs. It incorrectly handles cases where the optimal `y` is not a divisor of `x` but maximizes the expression. Therefore, the program is not correct based on the given problem description and example outputs.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
