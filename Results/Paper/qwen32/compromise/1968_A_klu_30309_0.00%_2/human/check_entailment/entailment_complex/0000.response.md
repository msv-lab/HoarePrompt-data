### Reasoning:

The given program aims to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The strategy employed in the function `func_1(x)` is to start checking from \( y = x-1 \) down to \( y = 2 \) and return the first \( y \) that meets the condition \( x \% y == 0 \) (i.e., \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \)) and \( 2 * y \ge x \). If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest proper divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x/2 \), or `1` if \( x \) is a prime number.

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

1. **Divisor Check**: The program correctly checks for divisors of \( x \) by iterating from \( x-1 \) to \( 2 \) and checking if \( x \% y == 0 \).
2. **Maximization Condition**: The condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) is a key part of the program's logic. If \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) and \( 2 * y \ge x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \), and thus \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 2 * y \). This is a strong candidate for maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because \( 2 * y \) grows linearly with \( y \).
3. **Return Largest Proper Divisor**: If no \( y \) satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \), the function returns the largest proper divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x/2 \). This is a reasonable fallback because it ensures that \( y \) is still a divisor of \( x \) and relatively large, which helps in maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
4. **Prime Check**: If \( x \) is a prime number, the function correctly returns `1` because the only proper divisor of a prime number is `1`.

Given the constraints and the logic, the program is designed to find a \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) efficiently. The provided annotated states and the logic in the function align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
