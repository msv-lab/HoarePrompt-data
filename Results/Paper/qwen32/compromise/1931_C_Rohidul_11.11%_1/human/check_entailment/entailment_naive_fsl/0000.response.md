Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for making all elements of the array equal with the least amount of burles. Let's analyze the logic and find a counterexample.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation of assigning a value `x` to a subarray from index `i` to `j`. The cost of the operation is `(j - i + 1)` burles. The task is to find the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis:
The program tries to find the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are the same and then calculates the cost based on the remaining middle part of the array. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum cost in all cases.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 1
```
- The longest prefix and suffix that are the same are `1` on both ends.
- The program will calculate the cost as `5 - 2 - 1 = 2` (since `l = 0` and `r = 3`).
- However, the optimal way to make all elements equal is to change the middle part `[2, 2, 1]` to `1` or `2`, which costs `3` burles.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve finding the most frequent element in the array and then determining the minimum cost to make all elements equal to that most frequent element. This can be done by considering the cost of changing segments of the array to the most frequent element.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not work correctly for all cases, as demonstrated by the counterexample. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
