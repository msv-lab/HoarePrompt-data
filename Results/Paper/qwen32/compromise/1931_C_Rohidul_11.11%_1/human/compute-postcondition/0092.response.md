The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `r` will be one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is the list of integers read from the input; `l` is the index where the sequence of identical elements at the start of the list ends; `r` is `r - 1`; `st` is the count of identical elements at the start of the list; `end` is 2; `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`; if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l` unless `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, in which case `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.**
