To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head: `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

1. **Condition 1: `l < r`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` was incremented by 1 (`l = l + 1`).
   - `r` is fixed as `n - 1`.
   - To ensure `l < r` for the next iteration, `l` must still be less than `r`.

2. **Condition 2: `a[l] == a[l + 1]`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a[l]` was equal to `a[l + 1]`.
   - To ensure `a[l] == a[l + 1]` for the next iteration, `a[l]` must still be equal to `a[l + 1]`.

Given the provided state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the list of integers read from the input where `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]`; `l` is such that `l < r` and `l` is now `l + 1`; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 2; `end` is 0; `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and the values of `st` and `end`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `l` so that it remains less than `r` and `a[l]` remains equal to `a[l + 1]`. Since `l` has already been incremented, we need to ensure that the new `l` is still valid.

### Adjustment:
- `l` should be adjusted to a value such that `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. Since `l` was incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `a[l]` (the new `l`) is equal to `a[l + 1]`. This means that the list `a` should have consecutive equal elements starting from the new `l`.

### Final State:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` for the new `l`.
- `l` is now `l + 1` from the previous iteration, and it must satisfy `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
- `r` remains the same.
- `st` remains the same.
- `end` remains the same.
- `ans` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the list of integers read from the input where `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]`; `l` is such that `l < r` and `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]`; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 2; `end` is 0; `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and the values of `st` and `end`.**
