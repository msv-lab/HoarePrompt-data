Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are equal and at least one pair of consecutive elements are different; `l` is the first index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]`; `r` is `l + 1`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first non-equal element is encountered.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `r` will have decremented to the point where `a[r]` is no longer equal to `a[r - 1]`, stopping right after the last sequence of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list. The variable `end` will count how many such consecutive equal elements were found from the end of the list. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, and `st` remain unchanged from their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.
