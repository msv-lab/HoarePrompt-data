Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least two elements where `a[1] == a[2]`; `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
