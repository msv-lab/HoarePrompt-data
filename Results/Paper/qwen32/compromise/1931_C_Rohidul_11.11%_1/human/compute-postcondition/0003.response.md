The code snippet initializes two variables, `l` and `r`, with the values `0` and `n - 1`, respectively. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**
