To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `a` is the list of integers read from the input.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is 0.
- `end` is 0.
- `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and the values of `st` and `end`.

The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `l < r`:**
   - Initially, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `0 < n - 1` must be true, which means `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is 1, the condition `l < r` will be false, and the loop will not execute.

2. **Condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`:**
   - Initially, `l` is 0, so this condition translates to `a[0] == a[1]`.
   - For the loop to execute, the first two elements of the list `a` must be equal.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop can execute the first time, we need to adjust the state such that:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the list of integers read from the input where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 0; `end` is 0; `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and the values of `st` and `end`.**
