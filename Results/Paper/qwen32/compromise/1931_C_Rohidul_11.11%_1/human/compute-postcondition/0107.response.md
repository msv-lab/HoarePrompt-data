Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of elements that can be removed from both ends of the list `a` such that the remaining list is non-empty and the first and last elements of the remaining list are not the same. If the list cannot be shortened under these conditions, it prints 0.**
