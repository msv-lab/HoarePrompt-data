Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is the list of integers read from the input with `a[0] == a[1]`; `l` is 1; `r` is at least 1; `st` is 2; `end` is 0; if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l` unless `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, in which case `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `st` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
