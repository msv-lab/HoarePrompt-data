The code snippet increments the value of `st` by 1. Therefore, `st` which was initially 2, will now be 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer greater than 3; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least two elements where `a[2] == a[3]`; `l` is 3; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 3; `end` is 0**
