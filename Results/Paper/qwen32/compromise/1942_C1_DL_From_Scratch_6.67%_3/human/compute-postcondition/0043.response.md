Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n`, `y` are integers obtained from the input, `list0` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i`, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`. If `num` equals 1, `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2.**
