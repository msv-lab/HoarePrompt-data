Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0, `x`, `n`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input. If `num` is 1, then `count` is the number of times `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` equals 1 for `i` ranging from 0 to `x - 2` plus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. `num` is `n - list0[-1]`.**
