You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from a regular polygon with `n` sides. However, in this version of the problem, `y` is always `0`, meaning we cannot add any new vertices. We can only use the `x` vertices already chosen by Bessie.

### Key Observations:
1. **Vertices and Triangles**: To form a triangle using the chosen vertices, we need at least 3 vertices. If we have `x` vertices, the maximum number of triangles we can form without adding any new vertices is limited by the gaps between these vertices.
2. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: The problem requires that the diagonals formed do not intersect. This means that once a diagonal is drawn, it divides the polygon into two parts, and no other diagonal can cross it.
3. **Counting Triangles**: The number of triangles that can be formed is related to how many "gaps" exist between the chosen vertices. Each gap of length 1 (i.e., two adjacent chosen vertices with no vertices in between) can potentially contribute to forming a triangle when combined with another vertex.

### Solution Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to count the number of gaps of length 1 between the chosen vertices and uses this information to determine the maximum number of triangles.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
1. **Input Parsing**: The solution reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`. It also reads the list of `x` vertices.
2. **Sorting**: The list of chosen vertices is sorted to facilitate counting the gaps between them.
3. **Counting Gaps**: The solution iterates through the sorted list of vertices and counts the number of gaps of length 1 between consecutive vertices. It also checks the gap between the last vertex and the first vertex (considering the polygon is circular).
4. **Calculating Triangles**: The number of triangles is calculated as the number of gaps of length 1 plus `x - 2`. The term `x - 2` accounts for the fact that with `x` vertices, we can form at most `x - 2` non-intersecting triangles.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The logic in the solution seems flawed because it assumes that every gap of length 1 directly contributes to forming a triangle, which is not necessarily true. Additionally, the formula `count + x - 2` does not correctly account for all possible configurations of triangles that can be formed with the given vertices.

### Counterexample:
Consider a polygon with `n = 8` and `x = 4` vertices chosen as `[1, 3, 5, 7]`. There are no gaps of length 1, but we can still form 2 triangles: `(1, 3, 5)` and `(3, 5, 7)`. The provided solution would incorrectly output `0` triangles for this case.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided solution does not correctly compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.
