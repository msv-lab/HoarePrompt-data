The code snippet initializes two variables, `i` and `j`, with specific values. `i` is set to 0, and `j` is set to the length of the `unique_chars` list minus 1. The other variables, `s` and `unique_chars`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of strings, where each string `b` in `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and represents the result of encoding an original string `s`; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of the strings in `s`; `i` is 0; `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.**
