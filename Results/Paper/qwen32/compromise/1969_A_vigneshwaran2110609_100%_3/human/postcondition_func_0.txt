The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it determines and prints either `2` or `3` based on whether there exists an index `i` such that `p[p[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`. If such an index exists, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`.
