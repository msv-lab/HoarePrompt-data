The code snippet reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into a list of substrings separated by whitespace, and then maps each substring to an integer, creating a list of integers `l`. The initial values of `i` and `flag` are not altered by this code, and the loop printing `3` is not affected either.

Output State: **`i` is the input integer, `flag` is `False`, and the loop prints `3`; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
