Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for most cases, but it has a few issues that can lead to incorrect outputs:

1. **Leading Zeros in Minutes**: The program does not handle leading zeros in the minutes correctly. For example, if the input is `09:05`, the program will output `09:5 AM` instead of `09:05 AM`. This is because `m` is not being formatted to always have two digits.

2. **Edge Cases for Hours**: The program correctly handles most hours, but it could be simplified and made more robust. For example, the conversion logic can be simplified using modular arithmetic.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output formatting is mostly correct, but due to the issue with minutes, it can produce incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        period = 'AM'
        if h == 0:
            h1 = 12
        elif h == 12:
            h1 = 12
            period = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h1 = h - 12
            period = 'PM'
        else:
            h1 = h
        print(f"{h1:02}:{m:02} {period}")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minutes are always printed with two digits and handles the conversion of hours correctly.
