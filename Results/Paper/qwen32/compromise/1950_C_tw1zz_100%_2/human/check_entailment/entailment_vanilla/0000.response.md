Reasoning:
The provided program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for each of the test cases. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the input string `s` in the format `hh:mm`.
3. It splits the string into hours `h` and minutes `m`.
4. It then uses a series of `if-elif` statements to map the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format:
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, it sets `h1` to the same hour and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, it sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `PM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, it sets `h1` to the hour minus 12 (to convert it to the 12-hour format) and `time` to `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, it sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `AM` (midnight).
5. Finally, it prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM`.

The program handles all edge cases, such as midnight (`00:00`) and noon (`12:00`), correctly.

Given the provided example, the program will produce the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
