Functionality: **The function `find_max` accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and a non-negative integer `bit` (where 0 <= bit < 30). It recursively processes the list based on the specified bit and returns either the length of the list or a maximum value derived from recursive calls and the length of a derived list `new_arr`.**
