You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the maximum number of segments `k` in an array `a` such that:
- The segments are contiguous and cover the entire array from index 1 to n.
- The bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of each segment is less than or equal to a given number `x`.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(arr, x)`: This function simply calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
2. `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`: This function recursively tries to partition the array into segments based on the current bit being considered (from the most significant bit, 31, down to 0).

### Detailed Breakdown of `find_max` Function

- **Base Case**: If `bit == -1`, it means all bits have been considered, and the array can be fully partitioned. The function returns the length of the current array, which represents the number of segments.
- **Recursive Case**:
  - It initializes an empty list `new_arr` to store the XORs of segments.
  - It initializes `xor` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative XOR of elements.
  - It iterates over the elements of `cur_arr`, updating `xor` with the XOR of the current element.
  - If the current bit of `xor` is 0 (`not xor >> bit & 1`), it means the current segment can be finalized because the XOR value does not contribute to the current bit. The segment's XOR is added to `new_arr`, and `xor` is reset to 0.
  - After the loop, if the current bit of `xor` is 1 (`xor >> bit & 1`), it means the last segment cannot be finalized without exceeding the limit, and `thing1` is set to -1.
  - If the current bit of `xor` is 0, it means the last segment can be finalized, and the function recursively calls itself with the new array of segment XORs and the next bit (`find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`).
  - If the current bit of `x` is 1 (`x >> bit & 1`), it means the current bit can be used, and the function returns the maximum of two possibilities:
    - The number of segments if the current bit is considered (`find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`).
    - The number of segments if the current bit is not considered (`len(new_arr)`).
  - If the current bit of `x` is 0, it means the current bit cannot be used, and the function returns `thing1`.

### Correctness Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by considering each bit position from the most significant to the least significant. However, there are several issues:

1. **Initialization of `thing1`**: The variable `thing1` is initialized to -1 when the last segment's XOR has the current bit set, but it is not used correctly. It should be used to represent the maximum number of segments if the last segment cannot be finalized due to the current bit being set.
2. **Logic for Final Segment**: The logic for handling the final segment is incorrect. If the final segment's XOR has the current bit set, it should be considered in the final result.
3. **Handling of `x`**: The function does not correctly handle the case when `x` is 0, which should result in a maximum of 1 segment if the entire array's XOR is 0, or -1 otherwise.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
