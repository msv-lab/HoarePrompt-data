The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` remains the same as the initial value, `n` remains the same as the initial value, `m` remains the same as the initial value, `k` must be greater than 0, `M` remains the same as the initial value, `c` remains the same as the initial value, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input, `i` is 1, `s` is `c^2 * (k + m + 1) * m + 2 * c * a`**
