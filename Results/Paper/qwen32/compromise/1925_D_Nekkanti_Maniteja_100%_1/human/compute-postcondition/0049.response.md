The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This affects the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, but does not change the values of `t`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, or `i`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * ((c * m * k * (k-1) // 2) % M + k * a % M) % M`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `i` is `k + m + 1`.**
