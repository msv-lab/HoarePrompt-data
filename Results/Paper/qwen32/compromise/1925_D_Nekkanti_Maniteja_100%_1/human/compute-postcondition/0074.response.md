Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with `m` pairs of integers `(a_i, b_i)` and associated values `f_i`. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific value `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is derived from the inputs provided.**
