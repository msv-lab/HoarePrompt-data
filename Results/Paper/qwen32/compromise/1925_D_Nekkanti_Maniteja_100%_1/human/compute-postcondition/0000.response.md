The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is used in the `range` function with the argument `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the argument to `range` must be greater than 0. This means that the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer.

Given the problem statement, the variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is given that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\). Therefore, the loop will execute because `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `i`, and `t` (the input to the loop) is already guaranteed to be a positive integer, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized but will be set by the range function using the value of `t`**
