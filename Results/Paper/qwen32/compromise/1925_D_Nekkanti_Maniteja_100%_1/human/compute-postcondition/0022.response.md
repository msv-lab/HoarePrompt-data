To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the loop and how the variables `s` and `i` change with each iteration.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `M` is 1000000007.
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.
- `s` is 0.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop iterations.
- `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates `k` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`. In each iteration, `s` is updated according to the formula:
\[ s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \]
\[ s = s + c^2 \cdot i \cdot m + c \cdot a \]

Since `c` is a constant, we can simplify the update of `s` as:
\[ s = s + (c^2 \cdot m \cdot i + c \cdot a) \]

Let's break this down:
- `c^2` is a constant.
- `m` is a constant.
- `a` is a constant.
- `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`.

The sum of the series of `i` from 0 to `k-1` is given by the formula for the sum of the first `k-1` integers:
\[ \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i = \frac{(k-1) \cdot k}{2} \]

Thus, the update to `s` can be expressed as:
\[ s = s + c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{(k-1) \cdot k}{2} + c \cdot a \cdot k \]

### Final Output State:
After `k` iterations, the final value of `s` will be:
\[ s = s + c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{(k-1) \cdot k}{2} + c \cdot a \cdot k \]

Since `s` starts at 0, the final value of `s` is:
\[ s = c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{(k-1) \cdot k}{2} + c \cdot a \cdot k \]

The loop variable `i` will be equal to `k` after the loop completes.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop iterations, `i` is `k`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `s` will have been updated to a specific value based on the constants and the number of iterations `k`, while `i` will have reached the value `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions except for `s` and `i`.
