Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop iterations, `i` is the loop variable that will be assigned values from the range `k`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `s` has been updated to include the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a`. All other variables retain their initial values or states.
