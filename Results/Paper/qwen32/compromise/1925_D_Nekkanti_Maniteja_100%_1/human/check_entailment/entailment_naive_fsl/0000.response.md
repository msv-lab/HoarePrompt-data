Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Combinatorial Probability**: The code uses `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` to calculate the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs. This is correct for finding the probability of selecting any specific pair in one excursion. However, the subsequent calculations are incorrect.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The loop `for i in range(k):` attempts to calculate the sum of friendship values, but the formula used inside the loop is incorrect. The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should consider the probability of selecting each friend pair and the incremental increase in their friendship values.

3. **Friendship Value Update**: The code sums up the initial friendship values (`a`) and then incorrectly tries to add the incremental values using a loop. The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the friendship values for each pair and then summing them up.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the correct approach:

- For each pair of friends `(a_i, b_i)` with initial friendship value `f_i`, the expected value of their contribution to the total sum over `k` excursions is `f_i * (1 + 2 + ... + k) / C + (1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) / C + ... + 1 / C`, where `C` is the total number of possible pairs.
- The expected value for a non-friend pair is `0`.
- The total expected value is the sum of the expected values for all pairs.

The provided code does not correctly implement this logic, leading to incorrect results.

Here's a potential counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2 3
1 2 1
2 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
12
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- There are 3 children and 2 pairs of friends: (1, 2) with initial friendship value 1, and (2, 3) with initial friendship value 2.
- The total number of possible pairs is `3 * 2 / 2 = 3`.
- The expected value for pair (1, 2) is `(1 * (1 + 2 + 3) + 1 * (1 + 2) + 1 * 1) / 3 = 10 / 3`.
- The expected value for pair (2, 3) is `(2 * (1 + 2 + 3) + 2 * (1 + 2) + 2 * 1) / 3 = 20 / 3`.
- The total expected value is `(10 / 3) + (20 / 3) = 30 / 3 = 10`.
- The final result is `10 * (3^(-1) mod (10^9 + 7)) = 10 * 333333338 = 3333333380 mod (10^9 + 7) = 12`.

The provided code will not produce this correct output, confirming that it is incorrect.
