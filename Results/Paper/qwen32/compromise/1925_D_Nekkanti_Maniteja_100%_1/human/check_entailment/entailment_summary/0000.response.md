Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Computation of Expected Value:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions involves considering the probability of selecting each pair of friends and the expected increase in their friendship values over the `k` excursions.
   - The program incorrectly calculates the expected value by assuming that the contribution of each friend pair is uniformly distributed and independent of the number of excursions, which is not accurate.

2. **Incorrect Calculation in the Loop:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` incorrectly attempts to compute the expected sum by adding terms that do not properly account for the probability of selecting each friend pair and the cumulative effect of their friendship values increasing over time.
   - The term `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly represent the expected increase in the sum of friendship values. The value `c` is the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is used to calculate the probability of selecting any specific pair. However, the way it is used in the loop does not properly account for the cumulative effect of friendship values increasing with each selection of a friend pair.

3. **Handling of Friend Pairs:**
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values `a` of all friend pairs, but it does not account for the fact that these values can increase over the `k` excursions based on the probability of selecting each pair.
   - The expected increase in the friendship value of each pair over `k` excursions should be calculated based on the number of times each pair is expected to be selected, which is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. This expected number of selections should be used to calculate the expected increase in the sum of friendship values.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - While the program correctly uses modular arithmetic to ensure the final result is within the required bounds, the incorrect calculation of the expected value means that the final result is not correct.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
