Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values involves calculating the probability of choosing each pair of friends and the cumulative effect of the friendship value increase over k excursions.
   - The current implementation incorrectly calculates the expected value. Specifically, the calculation `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The term `c * i * c * m` does not correctly represent the expected increase in friendship values, and `c * a` is not the correct way to sum up the initial friendship values considering the probability of choosing each pair.

2. **Handling of Probability**:
   - The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`. This probability should be used to compute the expected increase in friendship values for each pair.
   - The current implementation does not correctly apply this probability to compute the expected value.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - While the modulo operation is applied at the end, the intermediate calculations are not correctly handled, leading to incorrect results.

A correct approach would involve:
- Calculating the probability of choosing each pair of friends.
- Computing the expected increase in friendship values for each pair over k excursions.
- Summing up these expected values to get the final result.
- Applying the modulo operation correctly to handle large numbers.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.
