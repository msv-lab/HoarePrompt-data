### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Inputs:**
   - Number of children, `n`
   - Number of friend pairs, `m`
   - Number of excursions, `k`
   - For each friend pair, we get two children indices and their initial friendship value.

2. **Objective:**
   - Compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - Output the result as `p * q^-1 mod (10^9 + 7)` where `p/q` is the simplified fraction representing the expected value.

3. **Key Points:**
   - Each excursion, a pair of children is chosen uniformly at random.
   - If the chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.
   - We need to compute the expected sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem using the following steps:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Read the number of test cases, `t`.
   - Define the modulo constant `M = 10^9 + 7`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Read `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Sum up the initial friendship values of all friend pairs (`sum_f`).
   - Calculate the total number of possible child pairs, `cn2 = n * (n - 1) / 2`.
   - Compute `p` and `q` based on the formula:
     - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
     - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`
   - Simplify the fraction `p/q` by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - Compute the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M` using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - Print the result as `(p * q^-1) % M`.

#### Correctness Check:
- **Formula Verification:**
  - The formula used for `p` and `q` seems to be derived from probabilistic calculations involving the expected sums of friendship values over `k` excursions.
  - However, the formula provided in the code does not directly match the expected mathematical formulation for the problem. Specifically, the formula should account for the probability of choosing a friend pair and the increase in their friendship value over time.

- **Example Validation:**
  - Let's verify the second test case:
    - `n = 100`, `m = 0`, `k = 24`
    - No friend pairs, so the expected sum of friendship values is `0`.
    - The code correctly outputs `0`.

  - Third test case:
    - `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `k = 10`
    - Friend pair `(1, 2)` with initial friendship value `1`.
    - Expected sum of friendship values: `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55`.
    - The code correctly outputs `55`.

  - Fourth test case:
    - `n = 3`, `m = 2`, `k = 4`
    - Friend pairs `(1, 2)` with value `25` and `(3, 2)` with value `24`.
    - Expected sum of friendship values: More complex calculation involving probabilities and increasing friendship values.
    - The code outputs `777777784`, which matches the expected result.

- **General Formula Issue:**
  - Despite the correct output for the provided examples, the general formula used in the code might not be universally correct for all possible inputs.
  - The formula does not accurately reflect the expected value calculation involving the dynamic increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

### Conclusion:
While the code produces correct results for the provided examples, the underlying formula used may not be robust enough to handle all edge cases and scenarios as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed without a rigorous mathematical proof of the formula.

**Correctness: False**
