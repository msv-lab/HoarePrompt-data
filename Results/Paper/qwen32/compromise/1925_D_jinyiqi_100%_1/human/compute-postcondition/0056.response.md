The given code snippet updates the value of `p`. The new value of `p` is calculated using the formula `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `j` is 0, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `i` is `m + 1`, `t` is unchanged.**
