The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This affects the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, but does not affect the other variables (`sum_f`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `i`, `t`) unless they are recalculated based on these new values.

Given the initial state, the only changes are to `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the cumulative sum of all f values read over m iterations, `j` is equal to m, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is calculated as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `i` is m + 1, `t` must be greater than m + 1.**
