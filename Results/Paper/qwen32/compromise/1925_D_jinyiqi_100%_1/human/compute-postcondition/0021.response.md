To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the calculations and the variables involved step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `sum_f`: Cumulative sum of all `f` values read over `m` iterations.
   - `j`: Equal to `m`.
   - `cn2`: Calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `p`: Calculated as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
   - `q`: Calculated as `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`.
   - `gcd`: The greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

2. **Expression to be printed:**
   ```python
   print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
   ```

3. **Understanding the expression:**
   - `pow(q, -1, M)`: This computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`. In other words, it finds a number `x` such that `(q * x) % M = 1`.
   - `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M`: This computes the result of `p` multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`.

4. **Final Output:**
   The expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` calculates the modular division of `p` by `q` under modulo `M`. It effectively computes `(p / q) % M` where the division is done in the context of modular arithmetic.

Given the information, the exact numerical values of `p`, `q`, and `M` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical output. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(p * pow(q, -1, M)) % M (where p is calculated as (2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd, q is calculated as 2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd, and M is the modulus)**
