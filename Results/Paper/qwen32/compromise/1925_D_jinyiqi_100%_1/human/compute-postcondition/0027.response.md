Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is equal to `m`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is calculated as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `i` is `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the three integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `sum_f` has been updated to include the value of `f`. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions as given in the initial state.
