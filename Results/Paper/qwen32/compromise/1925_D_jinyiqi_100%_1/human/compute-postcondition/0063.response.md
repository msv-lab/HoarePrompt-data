Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n` (the number of elements), `m` (the number of connections), and `k` (an additional integer). It also receives `m` lines of three integers each (`a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`), representing connections between elements and associated values. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
