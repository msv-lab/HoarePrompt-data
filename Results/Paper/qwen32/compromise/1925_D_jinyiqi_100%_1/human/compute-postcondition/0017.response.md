The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `q`. The value of `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`, where `cn2` is already defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

Therefore, the new value of `q` will be `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`.

Other variables (`sum_f`, `j`, `cn2`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum_f` is the cumulative sum of all f values read over m iterations, `j` is equal to m, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`.**
