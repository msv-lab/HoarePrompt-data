Output State: **sum_f is the cumulative sum of all f values read over m iterations, j is equal to m; cn2 is calculated as n * (n - 1) // 2; p is calculated as 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1).**

Explanation: The value of `p` is calculated using the formula provided, while the values of `sum_f`, `j`, and `cn2` remain unchanged.
