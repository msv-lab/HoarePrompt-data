You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` in a permutation `p` of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}` such that `p[i] ⊕ p[j]` (bitwise XOR) is maximized. We can interact with the system by asking queries in the form of `? a b c d`, which returns whether `(p[a] | p[b]) < (p[c] | p[d])`, `(p[a] | p[b]) = (p[c] | p[d])`, or `(p[a] | p[b]) > (p[c] | p[d])`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR Value**:
   - It initializes `mak` to 0.
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it asks a query `? mak mak i i`.
     - This query compares `(p[mak] | p[mak])` with `(p[i] | p[i])`, which simplifies to comparing `p[mak]` with `p[i]` since bitwise OR of a number with itself is the number itself.
     - If `p[i]` is greater than `p[mak]`, it updates `mak` to `i`.
   - After this loop, `mak` holds the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
3. **Finding Candidates for Maximum XOR**:
   - It initializes `mak2` to `mak` and an empty list `pans`.
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, it asks a query `? mak mak2 i mak2`.
     - This query compares `(p[mak] | p[mak2])` with `(p[i] | p[mak2])`.
     - If `p[i]` is greater than `p[mak]`, it updates `mak` to `i` and resets `pans` to `[i]`.
     - If `p[i]` is equal to `p[mak]`, it appends `i` to `pans`.
   - After this loop, `mak` holds the index of the maximum element in the permutation, and `pans` holds all indices that have the same value as `p[mak]`.
4. **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR**:
   - It initializes `mak` to 0.
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`, it asks a query `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]`.
     - This query compares `(p[pans[mak]] | p[pans[mak]])` with `(p[pans[i]] | p[pans[i]])`.
     - If `p[pans[i]]` is greater than `p[pans[mak]]`, it updates `mak` to `i`.
   - After this loop, `mak` holds the index of the maximum element in `pans`.
5. **Output**:
   - It prints `! mak2 pans[mak]`, which should be the indices of the pair with the maximum XOR.

### Issues in the Program

The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly finding the pair with the maximum XOR:
1. **Incorrect Use of Queries**: The queries are not used effectively to find the pair with the maximum XOR. The program is essentially trying to find the maximum element and then comparing it with others, but it does not leverage the XOR operation to find the pair with the maximum XOR.
2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic for finding the pair with the maximum XOR is flawed. The program does not correctly identify the pair that maximizes the XOR operation.
3. **Potential Infinite Loop**: If the input is not handled correctly, the program might enter an infinite loop or make incorrect assumptions.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the pair with the maximum XOR using the allowed queries. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
