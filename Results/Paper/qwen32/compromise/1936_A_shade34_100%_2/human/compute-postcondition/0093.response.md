Output State: **t is unchanged, n is unchanged, mak2 is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, pans is unchanged, and mak is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `mak2` is now set to the same value as `mak`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `pans`) remain unchanged.
