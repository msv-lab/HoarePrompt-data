Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is the number of test cases (an integer between 1 and 10^3), and for each test case, `n`, which is the size of a permutation (an integer between 2 and 10^4). The function returns a result based on a secret permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} for each test case.**
