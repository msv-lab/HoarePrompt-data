Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is unchanged (we don't need this for the print statement).
- `n` is unchanged (we don't need this for the print statement).
- `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was `<`, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `pans` contains at least two elements.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`pans[mak]`**: 
   - `mak` is the largest index `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) where the input was `<`, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - Since `mak` is an index, `pans[mak]` refers to the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`.

2. **`pans[i]`**:
   - `i` is `i + 1`, meaning it has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `pans[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `pans`.

### Output:
The print statement will output a question mark followed by four elements from the `pans` list:
- Two occurrences of the element at index `mak`.
- Two occurrences of the element at index `i`.

### Final Output Description:
Given the initial state, the print statement will output:
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where mak is the largest index i (1 <= i < n) where the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, and i is i + 1)**
