The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `mak` after the assignment. However, we know that `mak` will take whatever value `i` holds.

Given that no other variables are affected by the code snippet, the output state will reflect the new value of `mak` and retain the conditions specified for the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be at least 2, `mak2` is unchanged, `mak` is the value of `i`, `pans` is unchanged.**
