In this task, the loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The underscore `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop continues based on the value of `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, or `mak` are directly involved in controlling the loop's execution. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted. The only relevant factor is the number of iterations left, which is determined by the input value.

Since the loop runs for a fixed number of times specified by the input, and since we don't have information about how many iterations have already completed, we can assume that the input value has decremented by one after each iteration. However, since we are looking at the state right before the next iteration starts, we do not need to adjust any of the given variables. The loop will continue to execute as long as the input value is greater than zero.

Thus, the state remains unchanged except for the implicit decrement of the loop counter which is controlled by the input.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was '>' when compared to the previous `mak` element, or 0 if no such comparison resulted in '>'**
