Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is unchanged (its value is not specified).
- `n` is at least `i + 1` (this implies that `n` is greater than or equal to the value of `i + 1`).
- `mak2` is unchanged (its value is not specified).
- `pans` is unchanged (its value is not specified).
- `mak` is set to `i + 1`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `mak`:** According to the initial state, `mak` is set to `i + 1`. Therefore, `mak` will hold the value of `i + 1` at the time of the print statement.
2. **Variable `i`:** Before the print statement, `i` is incremented by 1. So, the value of `i` used in the print statement will be the new value after the increment, which is `i + 1`.

### Substitution:
- Since `mak` is `i + 1` and `i` is also `i + 1` after the increment, both `mak` and `i` will have the same value in the print statement.

### Output:
The print statement will output a question mark followed by the value of `mak`, the value of `mak` again, the value of `i`, and the value of `i` again. Given that `mak` and `i` both hold the value `i + 1` at this point, the output will be:

Output: **? [i + 1] [i + 1] [i + 1] [i + 1] (where [i + 1] is the value of i + 1)**

However, since we need to provide the most precise description possible without knowing the exact value of `i`, we can simply state:

Output: **? [i + 1] [i + 1] [i + 1] [i + 1]**
