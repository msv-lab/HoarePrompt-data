To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is just `i` and `n` in this case. The other variables (`t`, `mak2`, `mak`, `s`, `pans`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop's syntax alone.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is unchanged
- `n` is greater than 0
- `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists
- `mak` is the current value of `i` if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists
- `s` is the new input string
- `pans` includes the current value of `i` if `s` is '='
- `i` is incremented by 1

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `n` remains the same (greater than 0)
- `i` is incremented by 1

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak` is the current value of `i` if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `s` is the new input string, `pans` includes the current value of `i` if `s` is '=', `i` is incremented by 1** 

However, to clearly indicate the change in `i`:

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak` is the current value of `i` if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `s` is the new input string, `pans` includes the current value of `i` if `s` is '=', `i` is [value of i at the end of the previous iteration] + 1** 

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we express it as `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value. If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then the state would be:

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak` is the current value of `i` if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `s` is the new input string, `pans` includes the current value of `i` if `s` is '=', `i` is `i_prev` + 1** 

But since we are not given `i_prev`, we simply say:

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak` is the current value of `i` if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `s` is the new input string, `pans` includes the current value of `i` if `s` is '=', `i` is incremented by 1**
