Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` and `n` are unchanged, but their specific values are not provided.
- `mak2` is the largest index `i` (where `1 <= i < n`) for which the input was `<`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.
- `mak` is explicitly set to `0`.
- `pans` is a list that contains at least two elements.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`mak` Value**: According to the initial state, `mak` is `0`.
2. **`pans[mak]`**: Since `mak` is `0`, `pans[mak]` refers to the first element of the list `pans`, i.e., `pans[0]`.
3. **`pans[i]`**: The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state or in the print statement. Given that `i` is used twice in the print statement, it suggests that `i` should be defined somewhere in the context not provided here. Without knowing the value of `i`, we cannot determine `pans[i]`.

However, since `i` is not defined in the provided initial state, we must assume that `i` is a placeholder or a variable that would be defined elsewhere in the code. For the sake of this task, we can only use the information provided.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can precisely determine `pans[mak]` but not `pans[i]` because `i` is not defined. Therefore, we will represent the output in terms of `pans[i]`.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and i is an undefined index)**
