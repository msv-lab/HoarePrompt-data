Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak` is the current value of `i`, `s` is the new input string, `pans` includes the current value of `i` if `s` was '=', `i` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The value of `mak` is updated to the current value of `i`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
