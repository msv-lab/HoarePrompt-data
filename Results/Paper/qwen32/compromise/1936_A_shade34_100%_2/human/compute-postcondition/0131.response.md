The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact numerical value. However, we know that `mak` is updated to whatever `i` holds.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`) remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `mak` is `i`, `pans` contains at least two elements, and the current input is '>'**.
