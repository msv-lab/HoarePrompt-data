The code snippet assigns the list containing the current value of `i` to the variable `pans`. This means `pans` now holds a list with one element, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak` is the current value of `i`, `s` is the new input string, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
