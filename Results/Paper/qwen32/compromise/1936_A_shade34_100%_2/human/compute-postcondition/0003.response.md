To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, the loop variable `i` iterates from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` will produce values starting from 1 up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is assigned the value of `t`
- `mak` is 0

We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. Since `n` is initially set to `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `n` is assigned the value of `t`, so `n` will also be greater than 1
- `mak` remains 0 (as it is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop execution)

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `mak` is 0**
