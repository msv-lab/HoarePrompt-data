The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. However, the initial state does not specify what the value of `i` is. Therefore, the only change we can definitively state is that `mak` now holds the value of `i`.

Given the initial conditions and the code execution, the updated state is:
Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged, `mak` is `i`.**
