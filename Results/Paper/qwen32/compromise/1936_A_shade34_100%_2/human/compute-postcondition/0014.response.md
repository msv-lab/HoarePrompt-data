The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`, starting from `i = 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is equal to `t`, which is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue executing.

Since `t` is greater than 1 and `n` is set to `t`, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again when `i` is 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is greater than 3, `n` is `t`, `i` is 4**. 

Note: The value of `mak` is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted based on the given loop statement.
