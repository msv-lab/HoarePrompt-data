Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `n` is assigned the value of `t`.
- `i` is assigned the value 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Literal String `'?'`**: This will be printed as is.
2. **Variable `mak`**: This variable is referenced twice in the print statement, but it is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its value based on the given information.
3. **Variable `i`**: This variable is defined in the initial state and is assigned the value 3. It is referenced twice in the print statement.

### Conclusion:
Since `mak` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, we must describe the output in terms of `mak`.

Output: **? mak mak 3 3 (where mak is an undefined variable)**
