The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(pans)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `pans`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last index that was processed, and `len(pans)` is the total number of elements in `pans`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and it must still be less than `len(pans)`.

Given that `i` is currently the last index processed, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`. The length of `pans` remains unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `pans` contains at least two elements, `i` is `i + 1`**
