In this task, the loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since the underscore `_` is just a placeholder and does not represent a variable that needs to be adjusted, the only thing we need to consider is the number of iterations left, which is determined by the value of `int(input())`.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration does not provide any information about how many iterations are left, we can infer that the number of iterations is decremented by 1 after each loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1.

Since `t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `mak` are all stated as unchanged, they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be the same except that the number of iterations left should be one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration. However, since we don't have the exact number of iterations left, we can only express that the input must be at least 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is unchanged, `mak` is the highest index i (1 <= i < len(pans)) for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such i exists, `pans` is unchanged, and the input must be at least 1 for the loop to continue.**
