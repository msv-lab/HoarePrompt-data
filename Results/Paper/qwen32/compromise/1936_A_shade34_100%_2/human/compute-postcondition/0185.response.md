The code snippet assigns the list containing the current value of `i` to the variable `pans`. Since `i` is initially 0, `pans` will now be `[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `pans` is `[0]`, `mak` is 0, `i` is 0, and `s` is the new input string.**
