Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak` is the current value of `i` if `s` was '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `s` is the new input string, `pans` includes the current value of `i` if `s` was '=', and includes the incremented value of `i` if `s` was '=', `i` is incremented by 1.**
