The code provided attempts to remove an element from the list `lst` at an index specified by `1 * 2`, which is `2`. Therefore, the element at index `2` of `lst` will be removed.

Given the initial state, `lst` is a list with the first element already removed. This means the list now has at least two elements (since the first one was removed and the code attempts to remove the third element).

Let's update the state of `lst` after the removal:
- Before removal, `lst` was a list with at least three elements (since the first was removed and the code removes the third).
- After removal, `lst` will have two fewer elements.

The other variables (`t`, `ans_f`, `i`, `ans`, `n`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`, `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 1, `ans` is 0 plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` before the removal, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is the newly input string, `lst` is a list with the first and third elements removed.**
