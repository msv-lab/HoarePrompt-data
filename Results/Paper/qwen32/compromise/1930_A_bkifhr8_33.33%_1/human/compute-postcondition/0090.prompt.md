Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 1; `ans` is 0; `n` is the newly input integer; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 1; `ans` is 0 plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` if `lst` has exactly 2 elements, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` retains its original form with potentially some elements removed; if the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 2; `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if `lst` has exactly two elements, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, with the first element removed and the third element removed if the length of `lst` is not 2. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` retains its original form with potentially some elements removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, the most internal loop is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 3; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, with the first element and the third element removed if the length of `lst` is not 2. If the length of `lst` was exactly 2, `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of `lst`, and the most internal loop is broken out of. If the length of `lst` was not 2, `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` after removing the first and third elements if applicable.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
