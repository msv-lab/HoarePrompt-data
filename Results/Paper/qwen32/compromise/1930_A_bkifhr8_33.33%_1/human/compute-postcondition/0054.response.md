Given the provided code snippet and initial state, the value of `ans` is being updated by adding the minimum of the two integers obtained from the list `lst`. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is 2; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. If the length of `lst` was not equal to 2, the first element and the element at index 2 (if it existed) were removed from `lst`. If the length of `lst` was exactly 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The value of `ans` has been updated by adding the smaller of the two integers from `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
