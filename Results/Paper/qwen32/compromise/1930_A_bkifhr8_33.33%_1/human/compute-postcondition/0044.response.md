The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which will terminate the most internal loop or if statement. However, since there is no loop or if statement provided in the context, the `break` statement does not affect any of the variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is 0; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`; `n` must be greater than 0; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. The length of `lst` is exactly 2.**
