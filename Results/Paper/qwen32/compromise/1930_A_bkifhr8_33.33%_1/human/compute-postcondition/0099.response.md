Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final values of `ans` for each test case and has `t` elements; `i` is the last element in `ans_f`; `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` until `lst` is reduced to 2 elements or fewer for the last test case; `n` is the number of pairs processed for the last test case; `l` is the input string for the last test case; `lst` is either empty or has 2 elements for the last test case.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop are completed, `ans_f` will contain the final calculated `ans` values for all `t` test cases. The variable `i` will hold the value of the last element in `ans_f`, which corresponds to the result of the last test case. The variables `ans`, `n`, `l`, and `lst` will reflect the state after processing the last test case, with `lst` being either empty or containing 2 elements.
