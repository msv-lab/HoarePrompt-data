To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases, \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `ans_f`: A list containing the final values of `ans` for each test case. It must have at least two elements.
   - `i`: The next element in `ans_f`.
   - `ans`: The sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` until `lst` is reduced to 2 elements or fewer.
   - `n`: The number of pairs processed.
   - `l`: An input string.
   - `lst`: Either empty or has 2 elements.

2. **Focus on `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly mentioned as "the next element in `ans_f`". This means `i` holds a value that is an element from the `ans_f` list.

3. **Determining the Value of `i`:**
   - Since `ans_f` is a list with at least two elements, and `i` is "the next element in `ans_f`," we can infer that `i` is the value of `ans_f[1]` (the second element of the list `ans_f`).

4. **Output Description:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is `ans_f[1]`.

Given the above analysis, we can conclude that the output will be the second element of the list `ans_f`.

Output: **ans_f[1] (where ans_f is a list containing the final values of `ans` for each test case)**
