### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem by processing each test case individually. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code and its logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n` (the number of pairs) and the list of `2n` integers are read.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The list of integers is split into a list of strings.
   - The program then iterates `n` times, each time picking two integers from the list, adding the smaller one to the score, and removing both integers from the list.
   - The loop condition and the removal logic within the loop are problematic:
     - The loop runs `n * 2` times, which is incorrect. It should run `n` times.
     - The removal logic `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` is incorrect. It should remove the first two elements, which can be done using `lst.pop(0)` and `lst.pop(0)`.
     - The condition `if len(lst) != 2` is unnecessary and incorrect for the logic of the problem.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, the result is stored in `ans_f`.
   - Finally, the results for all test cases are printed.

### Issues in the Code:
- The loop runs `n * 2` times instead of `n` times, which is incorrect and will cause an `IndexError` because the list will be exhausted before the loop ends.
- The removal of elements from the list is done incorrectly, potentially causing an `IndexError` or incorrect results.
- The condition `if len(lst) != 2` is not needed and can be removed.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()  # Sorting the list to always pick the smallest elements first
        for j in range(n):
            ans += lst[j * 2]  # Add the smaller of each pair
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to improper loop handling and element removal logic. A corrected version of the program is provided above.

**Correctness: False**
