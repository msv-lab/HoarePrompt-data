To determine the output state, let's analyze the given loop and its effects on the variables `max_index`, `min_indices`, and `min_index`.

### Initial State:
- `max_index` is `n-1`
- `min_indices` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-2]`
- `min_index` is `0`

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each element `i` in `min_indices`. For each `i`:
1. If `i` equals `max_index`, the loop skips to the next iteration.
2. Otherwise, it calls `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` and stores the result in `res`.
3. If `res` equals `'='`, it updates `min_index` to `i`.

### Key Points:
- `max_index` is `n-1` and will not be in `min_indices` because `min_indices` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-2]`.
- The loop will not skip any iterations due to the `if i == max_index` condition.
- The value of `min_index` changes only if `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returns `'='`.

### Outcome:
- Since `max_index` is `n-1` and not in `min_indices`, the `continue` statement will never be executed.
- The value of `min_index` will change only if `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returns `'='` for some `i` in `min_indices`.
- Without knowing the exact behavior of `func_1`, we can only deduce that `min_index` will be the last value of `i` for which `func_1` returns `'='`.

### Conclusion:
Assuming `func_1` returns `'='` for the last element in `min_indices` (which is `n-2`), the final value of `min_index` would be `n-2`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`max_index` is `n-1`, `min_indices` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-2]`, `min_index` is `n-2`**.
