To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `min_indices`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in min_indices:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `min_indices` is not empty. The current state provided is:
- `max_index` is `n-1`
- `min_indices` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-2]`
- `min_index` is `0`

To ensure the loop executes, `min_indices` must contain at least one element. The current state already indicates that `min_indices` is a list of indices from `0` to `n-2`, which means if `n` is at least 2, `min_indices` will have at least one element.

However, if `n` is less than 2, `min_indices` would be an empty list, and the loop would not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 to guarantee that `min_indices` has elements.

Additionally, the variable `i` will take the values from `min_indices` during each iteration of the loop. Since `min_indices` is already defined, `i` does not need any specific initial state; it will be assigned the first element of `min_indices` when the loop starts.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure `n` is at least 2.

State: **`max_index` is `n-1`, `min_indices` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-2]` (where `n` must be at least 2), `min_index` is `0`**
