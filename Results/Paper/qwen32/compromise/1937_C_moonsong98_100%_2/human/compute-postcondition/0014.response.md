To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the function call `func_2(max_index, min_index)` on the variables `max_index`, `min_indices`, and `min_index`. However, the code snippet provided does not include the definition of `func_2`, so we can only infer the output state based on the given initial state and the assumption that `func_2` does not modify its arguments directly (i.e., it does not modify `max_index` or `min_index` in a way that changes their values outside the function scope).

Given the initial state:
- `max_index` is `n-1`
- `min_indices` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-2]`
- `min_index` is `n-2`

Since the function `func_2` is called with `max_index` and `min_index` as arguments, and there is no information on how `func_2` modifies these arguments, we assume that the values of `max_index` and `min_index` remain unchanged. The list `min_indices` is not passed to `func_2`, so it also remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`max_index` is `n-1`, `min_indices` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-2]`, `min_index` is `n-2`**.
