To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the loop and how the variables `max_index` and `min_indices` change based on the output of `func_1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `max_index` is set to `n-1`.
   - `min_indices` is initialized to `[n-1]`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` is called.
   - The result of `func_1` can be `<`, `=`, or some other value.
     - If the result is `<`, `min_indices` is reset to `[i]`.
     - If the result is `=`, `i` is appended to `min_indices`.

3. **Determine the Output State:**
   - The value of `max_index` remains `n-1` as it is not modified in the loop.
   - The value of `min_indices` depends on the results of `func_1`:
     - If `func_1` returns `<` for any `i`, `min_indices` will be updated to `[i]`.
     - If `func_1` returns `=` for any `i`, `i` will be appended to `min_indices`.
     - If `func_1` never returns `<`, `min_indices` will accumulate all indices where `func_1` returns `=`.

### Conclusion:
The final value of `min_indices` will depend on the behavior of `func_1`. However, we can describe the general possible outcomes:
- If `func_1` never returns `<`, `min_indices` will include all indices `i` where `func_1` returns `=`.
- If `func_1` returns `<` at least once, `min_indices` will be `[i]` where `i` is the last index for which `func_1` returned `<`.

Since we do not have the specific behavior of `func_1`, we can only describe the general possible outcomes. For the sake of providing a concrete output state, let's assume the worst-case scenario where `func_1` never returns `<` and returns `=` for all `i` where `i` is less than `n-1`.

### Output State:
- `max_index` remains `n-1`.
- `min_indices` will include all indices from `0` to `n-1` if `func_1` returns `=` for all these indices.

Given the provided format and the assumption:

Output State: **max_index is n-1; min_indices is [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]**
