Initial State: 
- `max_index` remains `n-1` as it is not modified in the loop.
- `min_indices` depends on the results of `func_1`:
  - If `func_1` returns `<` for any `i`, `min_indices` will be updated to `[i]`.
  - If `func_1` returns `=` for any `i`, `i` will be appended to `min_indices`.
  - If `func_1` never returns `<`, `min_indices` will accumulate all indices where `func_1` returns `=`.

Given the assumption that `func_1` never returns `<` and returns `=` for all `i` where `i` is less than `n-1`, `min_indices` will include all indices from `0` to `n-2`. Therefore, `min_indices` will be `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-2]`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
min_index = min_indices[0]
```

This line of code assigns the first element of `min_indices` to `min_index`.

### Output State:
- `max_index` remains `n-1`.
- `min_indices` includes all indices from `0` to `n-2`.
- `min_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `min_indices`, which is `0`.

Output State: **`max_index` is `n-1`, `min_indices` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-2]`, `min_index` is `0`**.
