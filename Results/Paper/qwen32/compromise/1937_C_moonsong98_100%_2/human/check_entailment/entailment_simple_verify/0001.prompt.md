You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

    #     - If `func_1` returns `=` for any `i`, `i` will be appended to `min_indices`.

    #- If `func_1` returns `<` at least once, `min_indices` will be `[i]` where `i` is the last index for which `func_1` returned `<`.
    #
    #Since we do not have the specific behavior of `func_1`, we can only describe the general possible outcomes. For the sake of providing a concrete output state, let's assume the worst-case scenario where `func_1` never returns `<` and returns `=` for all `i` where `i` is less than `n-1`.
    #
    #### Output State:
    #- `max_index` remains `n-1`.
    #- `min_indices` will include all indices from `0` to `n-1` if `func_1` returns `=` for all these indices.
    #

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the given program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find a pair of indices (i, j) in a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1 such that the bitwise XOR (p_i ⊕ p_j) is maximized. The only way to gather information about the permutation is through a series of queries comparing the bitwise ORs of pairs of elements in the permutation.

### Approach:
The program follows a strategy to identify the maximum and minimum values in the permutation array:
1. It starts by identifying the maximum value in the array using queries.
2. Then, it identifies the minimum value(s) in the array using queries.
3. Finally, it compares the minimum values to find a specific one that, when XORed with the maximum value, gives the maximum possible result.

### Program Analysis:
Let's analyze the functions and the logic in the program:

1. **func_1(a, b, c, d)**: This function sends a query to the interactor and returns the result of the comparison between (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d).
2. **func_2(a, b)**: This function sends the final answer (the indices i and j) to the interactor.
3. **func_3()**: This is the main function that implements the logic to find the indices with the maximum XOR:
   - If `n == 2`, it directly outputs `! 0 1` because the XOR of the only two elements is the maximum possible XOR.
   - It then finds the maximum value in the permutation by comparing (p_0 | p_max_index) with (p_0 | p_i) for all `i`.
   - It identifies the minimum value(s) by comparing (p_max_index | p_min_indices[0]) with (p_max_index | p_i) for all `i`.
   - If multiple minimum values are found, it further compares them to find a specific one that, when XORed with the maximum value, gives the maximum possible result.

### Correctness:
The program seems to follow a logical strategy to identify the maximum and minimum values in the permutation. However, there is a critical issue in the logic:

- The program assumes that the XOR of the maximum and minimum values will yield the maximum possible XOR value. This is not necessarily true. The maximum XOR value can occur between any two numbers in the permutation, not necessarily between the maximum and minimum values.
- The program does not explore other pairs of values in the permutation to ensure that it finds the pair with the maximum XOR value.

### Conclusion:
Given the logic and the problem requirements, the provided program does not guarantee finding the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
