### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods and thus does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

Let's break down the problem and the provided program:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have two installations launching fireworks at intervals `a` and `b` respectively.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates `A = int(m / a) + 1` and `B = int(m / b) + 1`.
   - It prints `A + B`.

3. **Flaw in the Program:**
   - The program assumes that all fireworks from both installations can be visible simultaneously without considering overlaps.
   - For example, if `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 4`, the program calculates `A = 1` (`m/a = 4/6 ≈ 0.67`, so `int(0.67) + 1 = 1`) and `B = 1` (`m/b = 4/7 ≈ 0.57`, so `int(0.57) + 1 = 1`), and prints `A + B = 2`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of multiple fireworks being visible at the same time due to overlaps.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the period within which we can evaluate the visibility of fireworks.
   - We then iterate through this period and count the number of fireworks from both installations that are visible at each minute.
   - The maximum count during this period will be the answer.

5. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program calculates `A` and `B` as `int(m / a) + 1` and `int(m / b) + 1` respectively, and then sums them.
   - This aligns with the incorrect logic described above, further confirming the original assessment.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously due to the lack of consideration for overlaps. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
