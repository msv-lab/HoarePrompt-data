Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes). However, it does not consider the possibility that the number of moves `n` could be odd, which would allow Nikita to end up with an odd number of cubes, or even, which would allow an even number of cubes.

For example, consider the case where `n = 2` and `m = 1`. The program would output "No" because `n` is not greater than or equal to `m`, but in reality, Nikita can perform one move to add a cube and then one move to remove it, leaving him with 1 cube. Thus, the correct output should be "Yes".

Another example is `n = 3` and `m = 0`. The program would output "No" because `n` is not less than `m`, but Nikita can perform three moves to add three cubes and then remove all three, resulting in 0 cubes. Thus, the correct output should be "Yes".

The correct logic should be that if `n` is at least `m` and `n - m` is even, then it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) can be used to adjust the number of cubes by 2, and if `n - m` is odd, it is impossible to reach exactly `m` cubes.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
