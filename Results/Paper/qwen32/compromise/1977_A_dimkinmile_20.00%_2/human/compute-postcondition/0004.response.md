The initial state describes the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, but the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference these variables. Instead, it directly prints the string `'No'`.

Since there are no variables or conditions affecting the print statement, the output will simply be the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
