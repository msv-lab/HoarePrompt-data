Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap
The task is to distribute a certain number of coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. If such a distribution is possible, the program should output the distribution; otherwise, it should output `-1`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculating the Product:**
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod = k_1 * k_2 * ... * k_n`.

3. **Calculating `vprod`:**
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, it calculates `vprod[i] = prod // k_i`, which is the product of all multipliers except `k_i`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It calculates `den = prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den <= 0`, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to distribute the coins as required.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - If `den > 0`, it prints the values in `vprod`.

### Verification of Logic

The logic of the program relies on the following:
- The sum of `vprod` represents the total amount bet if we distribute the coins as `vprod`.
- For each outcome, the amount received back is `k_i * vprod[i] = prod`.
- To ensure that the total bet (`sum(vprod)`) is less than the amount received back for each outcome, we need `prod > sum(vprod)`.
- This condition is equivalent to `prod - sum(vprod) > 0`, which is checked by the program.

### Edge Cases

1. **All `k_i` are equal:**
   - In this case, `prod - sum(vprod)` will be `0`, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - Example: `k_1 = k_2 = ... = k_n = k`. Then `prod = k^n` and `vprod[i] = k^(n-1)`. So, `sum(vprod) = n * k^(n-1) = k^n / k = prod / k`. Thus, `prod - sum(vprod) = k^n - k^n / k = k^n * (1 - 1/k) = 0` if `k = n`.

2. **`k_i` values vary:**
   - The program ensures that the distribution is feasible by checking if `prod - sum(vprod) > 0`.

### Detailed Validation Using Annotations

Let's consider the annotations and validate the program's behavior:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
  - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20.
  - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

- **Inside `func_1`:**
  - `N` is read as the number of outcomes.
  - `vals` is read as the list of multipliers.
  - `prod` is calculated as the product of all elements in `vals`.
  - `vprod` is calculated as `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
  - `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.

- **Checking Feasibility:**
  - If `den <= 0`, the program prints `-1`.
  - If `den > 0`, the program prints the elements of `vprod`.

### Reasoning and Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the distribution of coins and checks the feasibility of the distribution based on the given multipliers. The annotations confirm that the states and transitions are as expected, and the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the distribution of coins and checks the feasibility of the distribution based on the given multipliers. The annotations confirm the correctness of the program's behavior.
Final: **True**
