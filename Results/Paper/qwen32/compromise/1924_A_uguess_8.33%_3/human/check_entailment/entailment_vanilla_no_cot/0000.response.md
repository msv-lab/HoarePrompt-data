Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Counting Subsequences:** The program attempts to count subsequences of length `n` by using bit manipulation, but this approach does not correctly count all possible subsequences of length `n` from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The bitmask logic is used to check if all characters from `a` to `k` have been encountered, but it does not ensure that all subsequences of length `n` are present.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence:** The logic for generating a missing subsequence is incorrect. The program tries to construct a subsequence that is not present in `s`, but it doesn't guarantee that this subsequence is of length `n` and is formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

3. **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `n` is large and `k` is small, the program might not be able to generate a valid subsequence of length `n` that is not present in `s`.

Here is a more correct approach to solve the problem:

1. **Generate All Possible Subsequences:** Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This can be done using a recursive approach or by using the `itertools.product` function in Python.

2. **Check Each Subsequence:** For each generated subsequence, check if it is a subsequence of `s`. This can be done using a two-pointer technique.

3. **Output the Result:** If all subsequences are found in `s`, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO" and provide one of the missing subsequences.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, subseq):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(char in it for char in subseq)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        alphabet = [chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(k)]
        all_subsequences = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
        
        missing_subseq = None
        for subseq in all_subsequences:
            if not is_subsequence(s, subseq):
                missing_subseq = subseq
                break
        
        if missing_subseq is None:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            print(missing_subseq)

func()
```

This program correctly generates all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and checks if each one is a subsequence of `s`. If a missing subsequence is found, it prints "NO" and the missing subsequence; otherwise, it prints "YES".
