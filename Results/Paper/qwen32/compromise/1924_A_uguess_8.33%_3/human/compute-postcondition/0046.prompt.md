Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop; `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop; `s` remains unchanged as it is only read, not modified; `cnt` is less than `n` and holds the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was found in the string `s`; `cur` will be 0 if the last processed subset of `k` distinct characters completed a sequence, or it will be a value reflecting the bits of the characters processed since the last completed sequence; `tmp` is an empty string; `ans` is a string consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table, repeated `cnt` times.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `cnt` is less than `n` and holds the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was found in the string `s`, `cur` will be 0 if the last processed subset of `k` distinct characters completed a sequence, or it will be a value reflecting the bits of the characters processed since the last completed sequence. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character that is `i` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table; otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string. `ans` is a string consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table, repeated `cnt` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `cur & 1 << i == 0`, then `tmp` is set to 'b'. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1. If `cur & 1 << i == 0`, then `tmp` is set to `chr(ord('a') + i)`. Otherwise, `tmp` is not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
