Output State: **`k` remains the same, `i` is equal to `k`, `tmp` is the last character set in the loop or unchanged, `ans` is updated to `ans + tmp`, and other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cur`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `tmp` to it. All other variables, including `k`, `i`, `tmp`, and the other mentioned variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cur`), remain unchanged.
