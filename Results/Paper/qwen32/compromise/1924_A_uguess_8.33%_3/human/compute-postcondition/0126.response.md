The code snippet provided is `cnt += 1`, which increments the value of the variable `cnt` by 1. No other variables in the initial state are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values; `ss` is the fourth element of `s`; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[3]) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged; `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
