Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `cur_ss` remain unchanged. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program continues without modifying `i`, `tmp`, and `ans`. Otherwise, `i` is set to `k`, `tmp` is set to the last character at position `i` in the alphabet where `cur & 1 << i == 0`, and `ans` is updated to a string consisting of the character at position `k-1` in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then followed by `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters.**
