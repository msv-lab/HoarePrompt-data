The code snippet provided updates the value of `cur_ss` by calculating the difference between the ASCII values of `ss` and the character `'a'`. Given that `ss` is the third element of the string `s`, the new value of `cur_ss` will be the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z').

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values; `cnt` is 0 if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` is 1; `cur_ss` is the position of the third element of `s` in the alphabet; `cur` is 0 if it was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` remains the same as its initial value; `ss` is the third element of `s`.**
