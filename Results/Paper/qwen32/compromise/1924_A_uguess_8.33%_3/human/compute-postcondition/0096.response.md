To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the variables involved.

The loop iterates `k` times, and in each iteration, it checks if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0. If it is, `tmp` is set to the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`. 

Given that `k` represents the number of iterations, and `cur` is a bitmask, the loop will check each bit of `cur` from the 0-th bit to the (k-1)-th bit. The variable `tmp` will be updated to the corresponding character if the bit is 0. However, the value of `tmp` after the loop completes will be the last character that met the condition `cur & 1 << i == 0`.

Since the problem states that `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `cur`, and `tmp` remain unchanged after the loop completes, and `ans` is a string of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, the final value of `tmp` will not affect `ans` directly. Instead, `ans` is determined by `k` and `cnt`.

The output state after all iterations of the loop can be summarized as follows:
- `k` remains the same.
- `i` will be equal to `k` after the loop completes.
- `tmp` will be the character corresponding to the last `i` where `cur & 1 << i == 0` was true, or it will remain unchanged if no such `i` exists.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` remains the same, `i` is equal to `k`, `tmp` is the last character set in the loop or unchanged, and other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `ans`) remain unchanged.**
