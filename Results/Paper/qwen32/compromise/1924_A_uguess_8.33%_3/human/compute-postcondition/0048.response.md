The code snippet appends 'a' repeated (n - cnt - 1) times to the variable `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **t remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, k remains unchanged, m remains unchanged, s remains unchanged, cnt remains unchanged, cur remains unchanged, i is k, tmp is chr(ord('a') + (k-1)), ans is ans + chr(ord('a') + (k-1)) + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)**

In natural language: The variable `ans` has been updated to include the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))` followed by 'a' repeated (n - cnt - 1) times. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `i`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged.
