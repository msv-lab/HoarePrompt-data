The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ss` for the next iteration. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was the current character being processed in the string `s`.
2. The loop iterates over each character in `s` sequentially.
3. To proceed to the next iteration, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Given that `s` is a string with at least 1 character, and `ss` has just processed the current character, the next character in the string should be assigned to `ss` for the next iteration.

Let's denote the current index of `ss` in `s` as `index`. At the end of the previous iteration, `index` would point to the position of the processed character. For the next iteration, `index` should be incremented by 1, and `ss` should be set to the character at the new `index`.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we only need to adjust `ss`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.

Since we do not have the exact index, we can represent the next character in a general form. If `ss` was `s[i]` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `ss` should be `s[i+1]`. But since we are not given the exact index `i`, we can say `ss` is the next character in the sequence.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.

To be more precise in the context of the loop:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0; `ss` is `s[i+1]` where `s[i]` was the value of `ss` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we do not have the exact index, we can denote the next character as `s[i+1]` where `i` is the index of the last processed character.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.
