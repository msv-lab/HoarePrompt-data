The provided code snippet initializes a new variable `tmp` with an empty string. This action does not affect any of the pre-existing variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, or `cur`. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the introduction of `tmp` as an empty string.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop; `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop; `s` remains unchanged as it is only read, not modified; `cnt` is less than `n` and holds the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was found in the string `s`; `cur` will be 0 if the last processed subset of `k` distinct characters completed a sequence, or it will be a value reflecting the bits of the characters processed since the last completed sequence; `tmp` is an empty string.**
