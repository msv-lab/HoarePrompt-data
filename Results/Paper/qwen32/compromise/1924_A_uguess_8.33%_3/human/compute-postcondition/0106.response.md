The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over the characters in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, the string `s` must have at least one character. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cur`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans`, and `cnt` are not directly involved in the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `s` has at least one character.

State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cur` is 0, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values; `s` is a non-empty input string; `cnt` is 0**
