The code snippet appends to the string `ans` a sequence of 'a' characters, the number of which is `n - cnt - 1`. This means the length of the string `ans` will increase by `n - cnt - 1` characters, all of which are 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `cur_ss` remain unchanged; `i` is `k`; `tmp` is the last character at position `i` in the alphabet where `cur & 1 << i == 0`; `ans` is a string consisting of the character at position `k-1` in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times followed by `tmp` and then followed by `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters.**
