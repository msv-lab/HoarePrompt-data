Given the provided code snippet and initial state, the value of `cur` is explicitly set to 0. This action overrides any previous value `cur` might have held, and no other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change in the state is the value of `cur`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values; `cnt` is incremented by 1; `cur_ss` is the position of the third element of `s` in the alphabet; `cur` is 0; `ss` is the third element of `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, and `ans` keep their initial values. The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. The variable `cur_ss` retains its value as the position of the third element of `s` in the alphabet. The variable `cur` is set to 0. The variable `ss` retains its value as the third element of `s`.
