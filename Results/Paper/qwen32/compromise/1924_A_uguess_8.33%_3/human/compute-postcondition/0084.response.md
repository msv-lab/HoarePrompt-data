The code snippet provided is `tmp = ''`. This line of code assigns an empty string to the variable `tmp`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **After the loop completes, `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `ans`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. `cur` will be `0` if the last value of `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`; otherwise, `cur` will hold the value of the incomplete set of bits that did not complete a full `(1 << k) - 1`. `tmp` is an empty string.**
