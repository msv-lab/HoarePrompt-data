Postcondition: **After the loop completes, `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `cnt` will be the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution, and `cnt` is less than `n`. `cur` will be `0` if the last value of `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`; otherwise, `cur` will hold the value of the incomplete set of bits that did not complete a full `(1 << k) - 1`.**
