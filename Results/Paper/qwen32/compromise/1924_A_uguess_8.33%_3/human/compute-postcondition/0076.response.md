The code snippet provided is `cnt += 1`. This means the value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans`, `cur`, `cur_ss`, `ss`) remain unchanged according to the initial state description.

If `cnt` was `0` or `1` before this operation, it will be `1` or `2` respectively after this operation. If `cnt` was already `2`, it will be `3` after this operation. However, the initial state specifies that `cnt` is `2` if `cur` was reset to `0`, otherwise `cnt` is `1`. Given this, `cnt` can only be `1` or `2` before this operation, and thus after the operation, `cnt` will be `2` or `3`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` unless it was `(1 << k) - 1` before the increment, in which case `cur` is `0`; `cnt` is incremented by 1; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, `cur` is incremented by `(1 << cur_ss)` and `cnt` is set accordingly. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` and `cnt`.**
