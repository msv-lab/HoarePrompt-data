The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur` are mentioned in the initial state description but are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **NO**
