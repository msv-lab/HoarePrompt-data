The code snippet increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Therefore, `cnt` which was initially 0, will now be 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` and the subsequent update of `cur` to 4 do not affect the current state of the variables because the code snippet provided only includes `cnt += 1`. The value of `cur` remains `(1 << k) - 1`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values; `s` is a non-empty input string; `cnt` is 1; `cur_ss` is 2.**
