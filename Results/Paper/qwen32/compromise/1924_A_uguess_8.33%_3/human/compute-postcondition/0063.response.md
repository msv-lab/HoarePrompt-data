The code snippet sets the variable `cur` to `0`. This change does not affect any other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans` remain unchanged; `cnt` is `1`; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; `cur` is `0`.**
