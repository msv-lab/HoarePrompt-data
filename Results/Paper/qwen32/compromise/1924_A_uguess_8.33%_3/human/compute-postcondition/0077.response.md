Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `0`; `cnt` is incremented by 1; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `cur` is explicitly set to `0`. The value of `cnt` is incremented by `1`. The value of `cur_ss` is calculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, and `ss` is updated to the next character in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
