Let's break down the problem step by step.

The provided for loop is:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range is defined by `k`. The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `k` is greater than 0.
- If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is set to the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust only the loop variable `i` and the range `k`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on a certain value, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Since `k` is the upper bound of the range and remains constant throughout the loop, it does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the incremented value of `i`.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is set to the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`**

However, since `tmp` is dependent on the `i`-th bit of `cur` and not directly influenced by the loop itself, we don't need to explicitly state the condition for `tmp` in the state. The important part is the value of `i` and `k`.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
