The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the current character `ss` being processed. At the end of the last iteration, `ss` was the last character processed, and the loop will execute again if there are more characters in the string `s`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the next character in the string `s`. Let's denote the next character in the string `s` as `next_ss`.

Given that `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and `cnt` and `cur` are updated based on specific conditions, we only need to adjust `ss` to the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `cnt` is `1` if `cur` was updated to `(1 << k) - 1`; otherwise, `cnt` remains `0`. `cur_ss` is `ord(next_ss) - ord('a')`. `cur` is updated to `(1 << k) - 1` if the initial `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`; otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged or set to `1 << cur_ss` based on the initial condition. `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.**
