Output State: **`eta_ln` is the length of `eta`; `rho` is `rho + 2 * q[eta[j - 1]]` (from the previous iteration); `eta_ln` is greater than 1; `res` is the updated value `res + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`; `j` is `j + 1`**

In natural language: The length of `eta` (`eta_ln`) remains unchanged and is still greater than 1. The value of `rho` remains as it was from the previous iteration (`rho + 2 * q[eta[j - 1]]`). The variable `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to its previous value. The value of `j` is incremented by 1.
