The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `eta`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `buffer`, `w`, `i`, `q`, `j`) are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the newly input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input; `i` is `i + 1`; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`; `j` is `n-1`; `eta` is an empty list.**
