The function reads an integer `t` from the input, then for each of the next `t` lines, it reads a string `arr` and determines if the string meets specific conditions related to the count of the character '1'. It prints 'yes' if the count of '1' is even and not equal to 2 with '11' as a substring, otherwise it prints 'no'. The function does not accept `start` and `end` as parameters and does not return any value; it only prints the results.
