You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the output state consists of `t` lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it checks if the first or last element of the list is odd and, if so, whether it is followed or preceded by an element that is exactly two more than itself. If either condition fails, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The given program checks if the first or last element of the array is odd and if the next or previous element is not exactly 2 more than the current one. However, this is not a correct way to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros using the described operations.

The operations described in the problem allow us to reduce the elements in a specific pattern, but the program does not correctly simulate this process or check the necessary conditions for all elements in the array. Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 2 2 1

Expected Output:
YES

Actual Output:
NO
```

In this example, the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` can indeed be reduced to all zeros using the operations, but the program incorrectly outputs "NO". The correct approach would involve checking if the array can be transformed by repeatedly applying the operations to reduce all elements to zero, which is not done by the current program.

The program needs to simulate the operations or derive a more comprehensive condition to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros, which it currently fails to do.
