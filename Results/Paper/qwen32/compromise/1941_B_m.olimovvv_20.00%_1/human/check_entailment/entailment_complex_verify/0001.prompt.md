You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the output state consists of `t` lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it checks if the first or last element of the list is odd and, if so, whether it is followed or preceded by an element that is exactly two more than itself. If either condition fails, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation allows decrementing elements at `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively for any index `i` between 2 and `n-1`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity Constraint:** The operation affects three consecutive elements, and the central element is decremented by 2. This means that if a central element is odd, it can only become even after an odd number of operations, and vice versa.
2. **Propagation:** The operation can propagate changes from the middle towards the ends of the array.
3. **Edge Cases:** The behavior of the first and last elements is particularly important. If the first or last element is odd and the adjacent element is not exactly 2 more than it, it may be impossible to zero out the array.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks the parity of the first and last elements and compares them with their adjacent elements to determine if it's possible to zero out the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. **Input Reading:** The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `b`.
2. **Condition Check:**
   - It checks if the first element `b[0]` is odd and if the second element `b[1]` is not exactly 2 more than `b[0]`.
   - It also checks if the last element `b[-1]` is odd and if the second-to-last element `b[-2]` is not exactly 2 more than `b[-1]`.
   - If either of these conditions is true, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis:
The program only checks the parity and the specific relationship between the first/last elements and their adjacent elements. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be zeroed out. The problem requires a more comprehensive analysis, considering the propagation of changes throughout the array. The provided program fails to account for such propagation and can give incorrect results for certain cases.

### Example Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
3
5
1 2 2 2 1
```
The provided program will output "YES" because it only checks the first and last elements, but it is impossible to zero out the array with the given operation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not fully account for the necessary conditions to zero out the entire array. It only checks specific conditions related to the parity and relationship of the first and last elements with their adjacent elements.

Correctness: **False**
