Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is an integer greater than 0; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `kq` is the sum of differences `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1`; `itest` is incremented by 1 from its previous value

The code snippet provided is:
```
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `ntest`, `a`, `kq`, `itest`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is an integer greater than 0; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `kq` is the sum of differences `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1`; `itest` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
