The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `ntest`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, which was initially described as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. The variables `n` and `a` (a list of integers) are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is the input integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
