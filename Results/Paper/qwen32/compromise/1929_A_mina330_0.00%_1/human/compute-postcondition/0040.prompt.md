Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is the input integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    kq = 0
    for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
        kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
    print(kq)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is an integer greater than 0; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `kq` is the sum of differences `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `ntest` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user such that `n` ≥ 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 provided by the user and `n` ≥ 2, `kq` is the sum of all differences `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, `itest` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `ntest` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the new integer input by the user such that `n` ≥ 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 provided by the user and `n` ≥ 2, `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, `itest` is the value of `itest` from the previous iteration plus `len(a) // 2`, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
