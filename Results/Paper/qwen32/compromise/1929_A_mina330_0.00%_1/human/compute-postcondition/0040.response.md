Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is an integer greater than 0; all `n` values are integers input by the user such that `n` ≥ 2 for each test case; all `a` lists are sorted lists of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for each test case; for each test case, `kq` is the sum of differences `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1`; `itest` has completed all iterations from 0 to `ntest - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have processed all `ntest` test cases. For each test case, it will have:
- Received an integer `n` such that `n` is at least 2.
- Received a list `a` of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9, inclusive.
- Sorted the list `a`.
- Calculated `kq` as the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, up to the middle of the list.
- Printed the value of `kq` for each test case.
- The loop variable `itest` will have gone through all values from 0 to `ntest - 1`, completing all iterations.
