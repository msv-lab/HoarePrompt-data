### Reasoning:

The goal of the problem is to maximize the "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after the array has been rearranged. The provided program sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, up to half of the array.

Let's analyze if this approach correctly maximizes the beauty:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array in ascending order is a good first step because it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Calculating the Differences**: By iterating from the smallest to the middle of the array and pairing each element with its corresponding largest element, the program calculates the differences that contribute to the beauty.

The approach works as follows:
- For an array `[a1, a2, ..., an]` sorted in ascending order, the beauty is maximized by calculating the sum of differences `(an - a1) + (an-1 - a2) + ...`.
- This is because the differences between the largest and smallest elements will be the largest possible, thus maximizing the beauty.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Beauty: `(3 - 1) + (2 - 2) = 2`
   - Output: `2`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`
   - Output: `0`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - Beauty: `(100 - 43) + (90 - 54) = 57`
   - Output: `57`

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Beauty: `(4 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1`
   - Output: `1`

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
   - Output: `1`

The program correctly computes the maximum beauty for each of the test cases. Thus, the provided program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
