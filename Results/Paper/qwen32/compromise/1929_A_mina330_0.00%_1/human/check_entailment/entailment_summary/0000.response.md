### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. 

The provided program sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This approach effectively maximizes the beauty because:

- By sorting the array, the smallest elements are at the beginning and the largest elements are at the end.
- The sum of differences a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i] for i in range(0, len(a) // 2) ensures that we are always subtracting the smallest available element from the largest available element, thereby maximizing the positive differences.

The execution summary confirms that the program correctly implements this logic for each test case, and the provided example outputs match the expected results.

### Correctness:
**True**
