### Reasoning:
Let's break down the function `func_1` and analyze its logic against the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Extracting and Converting Hours:**
   - It extracts the hour part `h` from the string `s` using slicing (`s[:2]`).
   - It then checks the value of `h`:
     - If `h` is '00', it prints '12' (since 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format).
     - If `h` is between '01' and '12' (inclusive), it prints `h` as is.
     - If `h` is greater than '12', it converts it to the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from the integer value of `h` and formats it with a leading zero if necessary.

3. **Printing Minutes and AM/PM:**
   - It prints the minutes part `s[2:]` directly.
   - It appends 'AM' if the hour `h` is less than '12', and 'PM' if the hour `h` is '12' or greater.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the transition from 12 PM to 01 PM and from 12 AM to 01 AM.
   - It also correctly handles the special cases of '00:00' (midnight) and '12:00' (noon).

### Checking the Annotated Program Against the Example:

Let's verify the function with the provided example:

- For "09:41", the function should output "09:41 AM".
- For "18:06", the function should output "06:06 PM".
- For "12:14", the function should output "12:14 PM".
- For "00:59", the function should output "12:59 AM".
- For "00:00", the function should output "12:00 AM".
- For "14:34", the function should output "02:34 PM".
- For "01:01", the function should output "01:01 AM".
- For "19:07", the function should output "07:07 PM".
- For "11:59", the function should output "11:59 AM".
- For "12:00", the function should output "12:00 PM".
- For "21:37", the function should output "09:37 PM".

All these outputs match the expected results.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly converts the given times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
