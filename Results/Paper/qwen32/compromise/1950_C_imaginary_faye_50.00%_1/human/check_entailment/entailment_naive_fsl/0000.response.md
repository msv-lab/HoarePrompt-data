Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that mean it does not correctly convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format according to the problem description:

1. The function `func_1()` is defined after it is called, which will result in a `NameError`.
2. The conversion logic for hours is incorrect:
   - If the hour is '00', it should print '12 AM'.
   - If the hour is between '01' and '11', it should print the hour as is followed by 'AM'.
   - If the hour is '12', it should print '12 PM'.
   - If the hour is between '13' and '23', it should print the hour minus 12, with a leading zero if necessary, followed by 'PM'.
3. The code does not handle leading zeros correctly for hours between 1 and 9 in the 12-hour format.
4. The list indexing to choose between 'AM' and 'PM' is incorrect. The condition should be `int(h) >= 12` for 'PM', but the list indexing should be `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`, which will not work as expected because `int(h) >= 12` evaluates to a boolean (True or False), not an index.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = int(s[:2])
        m = s[3:]
        if h == 0:
            h12 = 12
            period = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            h12 = h
            period = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h12 = 12
            period = 'PM'
        else:
            h12 = h - 12
            period = 'PM'
        print(f"{h12:02}:{m} {period}")

func_1()
```

This corrected version handles all edge cases and formats the output correctly.
