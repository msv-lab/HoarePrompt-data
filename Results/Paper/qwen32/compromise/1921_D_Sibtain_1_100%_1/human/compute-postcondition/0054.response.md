Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is 0, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`.**

In this output state, the variable `t1` has been assigned the value of the absolute difference between the first elements of the lists `a` and `c`. All other variables retain their initial values.
