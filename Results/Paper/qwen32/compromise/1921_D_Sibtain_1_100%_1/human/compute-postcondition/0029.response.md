Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order. If the length of `a` is 1 and the first (and only) element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then all elements in `a` and `c` are the same. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied and `a` is sorted. `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2` was greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 2. If `t2` was not greater than `t1`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, otherwise `i` is 2 and `j` is 1.**

Simplified: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` and `m` are integers, `a` is a sorted list with at least one element, and `c` is a list sorted in descending order. If `a` has one element equal to the first element of `c`, then `a` and `c` are identical. Otherwise, `a` is sorted. `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, where `t1` is the absolute difference between elements at index `i` in `a` and `c`, and `t2` is the absolute difference between elements at index `len(a) - j` in `a` and `len(c) - j` in `c`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `i` is 0 and `j` is 3; otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2. If `t2` is not greater than `t1`, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2; otherwise, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1.**
