The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of those components into an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
