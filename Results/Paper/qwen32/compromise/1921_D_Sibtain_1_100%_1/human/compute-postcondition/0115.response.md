To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the logic implied by the variables and the loop's logic.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. This variable indicates the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not affect the specific calculation of `ans` for a single run.
2. **`n` and `m`**: Integers read from the input. These likely represent the lengths of the lists `a` and `c`, respectively.
3. **`a`**: A sorted list of integers read from the input.
4. **`c`**: A sorted list of integers read from the input in descending order.
5. **`ans`**: The sum of the maximum differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` as per the loop's logic.
6. **`k`**: Set to `len(a) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
7. **`i` and `j`**: Final values after the loop completes, but their specific values are not important for determining `ans`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is calculated as the sum of the maximum differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`. Given that `a` is sorted in ascending order and `c` is sorted in descending order, the maximum difference for each pair of elements `(a[i], c[j])` can be achieved by pairing the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `c`, the second smallest element of `a` with the second largest element of `c`, and so on.

The loop likely iterates through the elements of `a` and `c` in such a way that it calculates these differences and accumulates them into `ans`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans`, which is the sum of the maximum differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`.

Given the information, the output can be described as:
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum differences between corresponding elements of the sorted list `a` and the sorted list `c` in descending order)**

This description precisely captures the value that will be printed based on the given initial state and the implied logic of the loop.
