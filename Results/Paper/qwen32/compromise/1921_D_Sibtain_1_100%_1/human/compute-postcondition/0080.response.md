The provided code snippet reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This operation replaces the previous value of `a` with the new list of integers. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a new sorted list of integers read from the input, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the input in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for all iterations, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` and `j` are updated based on the comparisons in each iteration.**
