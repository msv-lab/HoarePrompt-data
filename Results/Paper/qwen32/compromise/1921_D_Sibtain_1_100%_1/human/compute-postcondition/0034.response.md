The code snippet provided only modifies the variable `j` by incrementing it by 1. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `i`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order; `ans` is `2 * max(t1, t2)`; `k` is 2; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`; `i` and `j` are determined based on the comparison of the previous `t1` and `t2`; `j` is incremented by 1.**
