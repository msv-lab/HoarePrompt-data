You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It computes a cumulative XOR array `prefix` from the input list `arr`. It then calculates and prints a value `ans` which is derived from the bit counts of the cumulative XOR values in `prefix`. The function performs these operations for a single test case, as it does not explicitly handle multiple test cases within the provided code snippet.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n and f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z). The program seems to be attempting to use a prefix XOR array and some bit manipulation to count the tuples, but it does not correctly apply the conditions specified in the problem.

Here are a few issues with the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The prefix XOR array is calculated correctly, but the logic to use it to count the valid tuples is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Bitwise Logic**:
   - The program attempts to use bit manipulation to count the number of valid tuples, but the logic is not aligned with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program does not correctly check the condition f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z) for all valid (x, y, z) tuples.

3. **Incorrect Update and Counting Mechanism**:
   - The program updates the prefix and suffix arrays in a way that does not correctly reflect the number of valid tuples. The logic for updating and counting the tuples is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible (x, y, z) tuples and check the condition f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z) directly using the prefix XOR array. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(prefix[-1] ^ v)
    
    ans = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(x, n + 1):
            for z in range(y, n + 1):
                fx_y = prefix[y] ^ prefix[x - 1]
                fy_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[y - 1]
                fx_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[x - 1]
                if fx_y ^ fy_z > fx_z:
                    ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This program correctly iterates over all possible (x, y, z) tuples and checks the condition f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z) using the prefix XOR array. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^3), which might not be efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5). A more efficient solution would be required for large inputs, but this solution demonstrates the correct logic for the problem.
