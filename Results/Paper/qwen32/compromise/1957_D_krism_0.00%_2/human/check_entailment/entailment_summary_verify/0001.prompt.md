You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

- Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    print(arr, prefix)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    print(pre)
    print(suf)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It computes a cumulative XOR array `prefix` from the input list `arr`. It then calculates and prints a value `ans` which is derived from the bit counts of the cumulative XOR values in `prefix`. The function performs these operations for a single test case, as it does not explicitly handle multiple test cases within the provided code snippet.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that:
- 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n
- f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)

Where:
- f(l, r) = a_l ⊕ a_{l+1} ⊕ ... ⊕ a_r
- ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Processing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, T.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array, n, and the array itself.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - It calculates the prefix XOR array where `prefix[i]` is the XOR of the first i elements of the array.
   - This is done correctly as `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])`.

3. **Preprocessing for Counting:**
   - The program initializes two 2D lists `pre` and `suf`, each of size 32x2, to count the occurrences of 0s and 1s in the binary representation of the prefix XOR values.
   - It initializes `pre` with an extra count of 0 for each bit position, which seems incorrect because it doesn't account for the actual prefix XOR values at the start.

4. **Suffix Counting:**
   - It iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, updating the `suf` array with the counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position in the prefix XOR values.
   - This step is correct in terms of logic but might be off due to the initial incorrect setup of `pre`.

5. **Main Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through each possible y from 1 to n.
   - For each y, it calculates the number of valid (x, z) pairs using the counts in `pre` and `suf`.
   - It updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays as it processes each y.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of valid tuples for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Initialization of `pre`:** The initial setup of `pre` with an extra count of 0 for each bit position is incorrect. This might lead to incorrect results.
- **Logic for Counting Valid Tuples:** The logic seems to be based on counting the occurrences of 0s and 1s in the binary representation of the prefix XOR values, but the initial incorrect setup of `pre` might affect the results.
- **Updating `pre` and `suf`:** The program correctly updates `pre` and `suf` as it processes each y, but the initial incorrect setup of `pre` might still lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the initialization of `pre`, the program is likely to produce incorrect results for some test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
