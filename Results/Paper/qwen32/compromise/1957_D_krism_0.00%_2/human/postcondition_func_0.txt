The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It computes a cumulative XOR array `prefix` from the input list `arr`. It then calculates and prints a value `ans` which is derived from the bit counts of the cumulative XOR values in `prefix`. The function performs these operations for a single test case, as it does not explicitly handle multiple test cases within the provided code snippet.
