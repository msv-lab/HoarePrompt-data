Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final output state.

The loop iterates over each element `v` in the list `arr` and appends to the `prefix` list the result of the XOR operation between `v` and the last element of the `prefix` list. This means that the `prefix` list grows by one element in each iteration, and the new element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to the current index.

Given the initial state and the first few iterations, we can generalize the final state after all iterations. After `n` iterations, the `prefix` list will contain `n+1` elements. The first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are the cumulative XORs of the elements in `arr`.

The final state of the `prefix` list will be `[0, arr[0], arr[0] ^ arr[1], arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ arr[2], ..., arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[n-1]]`.

Here's the final output state after the loop executes all the iterations:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9; `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`.**

In simple terms, the `prefix` list will start with `0` and each subsequent element will be the result of XORing all the elements of `arr` up to that point.
