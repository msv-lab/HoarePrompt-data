Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9; `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`; `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except each `pre[i][0]` for i in range(32) which is 1; `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros; `i` is 31.`**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop are completed, the `pre` list will have each of its 32 sublists with the first element set to 1 (i.e., `pre[i][0]` is 1 for all `i` from 0 to 31). All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `suf`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The loop variable `i` will be 31, indicating that the loop has completed all 32 iterations.
