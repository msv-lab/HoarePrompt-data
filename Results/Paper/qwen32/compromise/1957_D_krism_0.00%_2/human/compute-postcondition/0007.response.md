The code appends the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` to the `prefix` list. Given the initial state, `prefix` is a list with two elements `[0, v]`. The last element of `prefix` is `v`. Therefore, `v ^ prefix[-1]` is `v ^ v`, which equals `0` because any number XORed with itself is `0`. 

After appending, `prefix` becomes `[0, v, 0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9; `prefix` is a list containing the elements `[0, v, 0]`; `v` is the next element in `arr`**.
