To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. `i` is defined as `res[-1] + 2`. This means `i` is calculated based on the last element of the list `res` plus 2.
2. `res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `k`, and other variables are mentioned but not explicitly defined in terms of their values. We only know that `res` is unchanged, and `ul` and `ur` are not equal unless they become equal after the if condition is checked.
3. `a` is a list, and `n` is at least 0.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Index `i` Calculation**:
   - `i` is derived from the last element of the list `res` plus 2. Therefore, `i = res[-1] + 2`.
   - The exact value of `i` depends on the value of the last element in `res`.

2. **Accessing Elements in List `a`**:
   - The code prints `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and does not end with a newline (due to `end=' '`).
   - This means the output will be the element at index `i` of list `a`, printed twice.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - The value of `a[i]` depends on the value of `i` and the contents of list `a`.
   - Since the exact contents of `a` and the value of `res[-1]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the code, the output will be the element at index `i` of list `a`, printed twice, where `i` is calculated as `res[-1] + 2`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where i = res[-1] + 2)**
