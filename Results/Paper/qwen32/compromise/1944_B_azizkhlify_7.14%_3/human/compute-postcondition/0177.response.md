Let's analyze the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `res` is a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`.
2. `i` is the next element in `res`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is described as "the next element in `res`". This means `i` holds the value of the element in the list `res` that comes after the current element being considered. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified directly; it is dependent on the current position in the list `res`.
- The `print` statement is using `end=' '`, which means that after printing the value of `i`, a space will be added instead of the default newline character.

### Output Explanation:
Since the exact value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it as the next element in the list `res`. Therefore, the output will be the value of `i` followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **i (where i is the next element in the list `res`)**
