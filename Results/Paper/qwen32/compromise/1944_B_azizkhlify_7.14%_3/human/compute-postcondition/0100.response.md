Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; n is an integer greater than 0; k is 2 * k - ul; a is a list of integers obtained from the input; l is a list of n integers where each element at index j is the count of occurrences of j + 1 in the list a; r is a list of n integers where each element at index j is the count of occurrences of j + 1 in the sublist a[n:2 * n]; ul is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list a, multiplied by 2; if ul != ur, then ur is updated to ul and i is set to 2 * n; otherwise, ur remains unchanged; res is an empty list; k is not zero if ul != ur; re is the count of elements in a that appear exactly once, up to the n-th iteration if ul != ur.**
