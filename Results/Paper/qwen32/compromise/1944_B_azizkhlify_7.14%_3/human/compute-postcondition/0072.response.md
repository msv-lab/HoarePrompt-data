The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` which iterates over the elements of the list `res`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in the list `res`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `k` is 2 * k - ul.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
- `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2.
- `ur` is 0.
- `i` is the first element of `res`.
- `res` is a list with at least one element.
- If `k` is not zero, `re` is the count of elements in `a` that appear exactly once, up to the n-th iteration. Otherwise, no changes are made to `re` and `res`.

To execute the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in the list `res`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ul`, `ur`, `re`, and `res`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is 2 * k - ul; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`; `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2; `ur` is 0; `i` is the next element of `res`; `res` is a list with at least one element; If `k` is not zero, `re` is the count of elements in `a` that appear exactly once, up to the n-th iteration. Otherwise, no changes are made to `re` and `res`.**
