Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `res` is an empty list `[]`.
   - `re` is 0.
   - `ul` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, otherwise `ul` remains unchanged.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `k` and other variables remain unchanged.
   
2. **Lists:**
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `l` is a list of length `n` with each element at index `a[j] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `r` is a list of length `n` with each element at index `a[j] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

3. **Condition:**
   - If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end.
- Given that `i` is 1, the value printed will be `a[1]` twice.

### Output:
Since `i` is 1, the print statement will output `a[1]` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[1] a[1]** (where `a[1]` is the second element of the list `a`)
