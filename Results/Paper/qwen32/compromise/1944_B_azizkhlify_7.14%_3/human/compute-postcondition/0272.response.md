Postcondition: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `0`, `res` contains up to `k` values of `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero, `re` is the number of such values (up to `k`), `ul` is `2 * n`, `ur` is `0`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of length `n` with elements incremented based on values in `a` from `0` to `n-1`, `r` is a list of length `n` with elements incremented based on values in `a` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. If `k` is zero, `res` and `re` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
