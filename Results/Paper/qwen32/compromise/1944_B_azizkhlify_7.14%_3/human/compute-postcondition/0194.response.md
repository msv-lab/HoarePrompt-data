Postcondition: **`i` is `res[-1] + 1`, `res` remains unchanged, `re` remains unchanged, `ul` and `ur` are not equal unless `ul` equals `ur` after the if condition is checked, `k` and other variables remain unchanged, `n` is at least 0. If `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, then `ur` is `ur + 2`.**
