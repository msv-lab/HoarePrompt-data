Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `res` is `[]`, `re` is `0`, `ul` is 4 if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, otherwise `ul` remains unchanged, `ur` is `0`, `k` and other variables remain unchanged, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is a list of length `n` with the element at index `a[0] - 1` incremented by 1, the element at index `a[1] - 1` incremented by 1, ..., and the element at index `a[n-1] - 1` incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.**
