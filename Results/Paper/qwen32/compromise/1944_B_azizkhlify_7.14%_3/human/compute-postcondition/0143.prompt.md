Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the second half of `a` (from `a[n]` to `a[2 * n - 1]`); `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `k` is not zero if `ul` != `ur`; `re` is 0; `i` is `2 * n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the second half of `a` (from `a[n]` to `a[2 * n - 1]`). If the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is equal to 2, then `ul` is set to 2 and `ur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged. `res` is an empty list; `k` is not zero if `ul` is not equal to `ur`; `re` is 0; `i` is `2 * n - 1`. Additionally, if `ul` equals `k * 2`, then `ul` equals `k * 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ul` and `ur` beyond their initial conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the second half of `a` (from `a[n]` to `a[2 * n - 1]`); `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged; `res` is an empty list; `k` is not zero if `ul` is not equal to `ur`; `re` is 0; `i` is 0. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ul` and `ur` beyond their initial conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the second half of `a` (from `a[n]` to `a[2 * n - 1]`); `ul` is incremented by 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, otherwise `ul` remains unchanged; `ur` remains unchanged; `res` is an empty list; `k` is not zero if `ul` is not equal to `ur`; `re` is 0; `i` is 1. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ul` and `ur` beyond their initial conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
