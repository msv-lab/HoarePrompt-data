To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 0. This variable is also not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.
3. **`l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1**: This implies that there is a list `l` and an element `a[i]` such that when you subtract 1 from `a[i]` and use the result as an index in `l`, the value at that index is 1. However, this does not directly tell us the value of `a[i]` itself, only that it must be an integer between 1 and the length of `l` (inclusive).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```
This statement will print the value of `a[i]` followed by a space. Since the exact values of `a` and `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the variable `a[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement will be the value of `a[i]` followed by a space.

Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is the i-th element of the list a)**
