Postcondition: **`i` is `res[-1] + 2`, `res` remains unchanged, `re` remains unchanged, `k` and other variables remain unchanged, `n` is at least 0. If `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ul` and `ur` are not equal. If `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, then `ur` is `ur + 2`.**
