Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; n is an integer greater than 0; k is 2 * k - ul; a is a list of integers obtained from the input; l is a list of n integers where each element at index j is the count of occurrences of j + 1 in the list a; r is a list of n integers where each element at index j is the count of occurrences of j + 1 in the sublist a[n:2 * n]; ul is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list a, multiplied by 2; ur is 0; i is undefined (as the loop has ended); res is an empty list; k is not zero, re is the count of elements in a that appear exactly once, up to the n-th iteration; ul is not equal to ur.**
