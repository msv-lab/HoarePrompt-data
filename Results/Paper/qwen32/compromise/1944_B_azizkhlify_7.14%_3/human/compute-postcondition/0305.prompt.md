Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50,000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; n is an integer greater than 0; k is 2 * k - ul; a is a list of integers obtained from the input; l is a list of n integers where each element at index j is the count of occurrences of j + 1 in the list a; r is a list of n integers where each element at index j is the count of occurrences of j + 1 in the sublist a[n:2 * n]; ul is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list a, multiplied by 2; if ul != ur, then ur is updated to ul and i is set to 2 * n; otherwise, ur remains unchanged; res is an empty list; k is not zero if ul != ur; re is the count of elements in a that appear exactly once, up to the n-th iteration if ul != ur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is either `2 * n - 1` or the value at which `ul` equals `ur`. `res` remains unchanged, `re` remains unchanged, `ul` and `ur` are either not equal or equal at the point the loop breaks, and `k` and other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements of `res` have been printed, and the state of other variables remains unchanged except for `ur`, which may have been incremented by 2 for each `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`. The loop terminates either after completing `n` iterations or when `ul` equals `ur`. If `ul` was not equal to `ur` initially, the loop has executed `n` times (or fewer if `ul` equals `ur` during an iteration).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
