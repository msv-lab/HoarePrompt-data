Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the second half of `a` (from `a[n]` to `a[2 * n - 1]`); `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged; `res` is an empty list; `k` is not zero if `ul` is not equal to `ur`; `re` is 0; `i` is 0. The loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `break` statement exits the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
