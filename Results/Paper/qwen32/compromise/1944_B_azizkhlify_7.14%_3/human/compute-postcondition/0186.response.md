Postcondition: **`i` is the last element of `res`, `res` remains unchanged, `re` remains unchanged, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `k` and other variables remain unchanged, `n` is at least 0. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Additionally, `ul` is equal to `ur`.**

In simpler terms: `i` is the last element of `res`, `res` and `re` remain unchanged, `ul` and `ur` were not equal before entering the if condition, `k` and other variables remain unchanged, `n` is at least 0. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Currently, `ul` is equal to `ur`.
