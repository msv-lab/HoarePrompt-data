To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to examine the given initial state and the specific variables involved in the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `re` is 0.
- `ul` is 4 if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2; otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged.
- `ur` is 0.
- `k` and other variables remain unchanged.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is incremented by 1 for `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is incremented by 1 for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

### Focus on the Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```
This statement prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and does not add a newline at the end.

### Determining the Value of `a[i]`:
- `i` is given as 2.
- Therefore, the value that will be printed is `a[2]`, which is the third element of the list `a`.

### Output:
Since we do not have the specific values of the list `a`, we can describe the output in terms of the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list a)**
