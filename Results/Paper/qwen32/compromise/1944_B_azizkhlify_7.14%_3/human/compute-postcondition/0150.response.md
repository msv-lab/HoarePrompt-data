The code snippet provided appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l[a[i] - 1]`, and `re`) are not modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000
- `n` is greater than 0
- `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1
- `re` is increased by 1

The only change is that `res` now contains the element `a[i]` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1; `re` is increased by 1; `res` contains `a[i]` as its last element.**
