Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 0.
3. **`k`**: An integer obtained from the input.
4. **`a`**: A list of integers obtained from the input.
5. **`l`**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`.
6. **`r`**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
7. **`re`**: Initialized to 0.
8. **`ul`**: Initialized to 0.
9. **`ur`**: Initialized to 0.
10. **`res`**: An empty list.
11. **`i`**: Set to `2 * n - 1`.
12. **Specific Condition**: The element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is equal to 2.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

#### Determining `a[i]`:
- `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`, which means `a[i]` is the last element of the first `2 * n` elements of the list `a`.
- The specific condition given is that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is equal to 2. This means that the number `a[i]` appears exactly twice in the list `a`.

### Output Determination:
- Since `a[i]` appears exactly twice in the list `a`, and the print statement prints `a[i]` twice, the output will be the value of `a[i]` printed twice, followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **`a[i] a[i]` (where `a[i]` is the value of the last element of the first `2 * n` elements of the list `a`, and it appears exactly twice in the list `a`)**

To provide a concrete example:
If `a = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 2]` and `n = 3`, then `i = 2 * 3 - 1 = 5`, so `a[i] = a[5] = 5`. However, since `a[i]` must appear exactly twice in `a`, let's adjust `a` to `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]`. Now `a[i] = a[5] = 2`, and `2` appears exactly twice in `a`.

Output: **2 2**
