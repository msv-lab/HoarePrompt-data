Let's break down the given information step by step to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is set to `next_element_in_res`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `res` is a list that contains at least one value of `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`.
- `re` is the number of elements in `res` (up to `k`).
- `ul` is set to `2 * n`.
- `ur` is set to `0`.
- `k` is an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` is a list of length `n` with elements incremented based on values in `a` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with elements incremented based on values in `a` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Value of `i`:
- `i` is explicitly stated to be `next_element_in_res`.
- The value of `next_element_in_res` is not provided directly, but it is implied to be an element from the list `a` that meets the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`.

### Output:
Since `i` is `next_element_in_res`, and `next_element_in_res` is an element from the list `a` that meets the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, the output will be the value of this specific element.

Output: **next_element_in_res (where next_element_in_res is an element from the list `a` that meets the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`)**
