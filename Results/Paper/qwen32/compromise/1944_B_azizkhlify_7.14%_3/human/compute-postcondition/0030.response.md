To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
2. `n` is an integer greater than 0.
3. `k` is an integer obtained from the input.
4. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
5. `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`.
6. `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
7. `re` is initialized to 0.
8. `ul` is set to 2 if the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is equal to 2, otherwise `ul` is 0.
9. `ur` is initialized to 0.
10. `res` is an empty list.
11. `i` is initialized to 0.
12. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `a[i]` refers to the element at index 0 of the list `a`.

Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` will be `a[0]`, the first element of the list `a`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the first element of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end because of `end=' '`.

Output: **a[0] a[0]**
