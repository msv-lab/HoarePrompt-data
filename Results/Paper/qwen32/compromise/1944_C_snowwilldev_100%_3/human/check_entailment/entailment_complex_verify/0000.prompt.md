You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: - After the loop finishes, `cnt` will contain the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. Each key in `cnt` corresponds to a unique integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list.
    #
    #Given this understanding, the output state can be described as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: the loop returns `N`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it returns the smallest integer from `0` to `n` that either appears exactly once in the list or does not appear at all.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle the game dynamics and optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Counting Single Occurrences:**
   The code counts the number of elements that occur exactly once (`t += 1`) and checks if this count is at least 2 (`if t >= 2`). This condition is not directly related to the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   The code attempts to find the MEX by checking the count of each number and returning the first number that either has a count of 0 or has at least two single occurrences. This approach does not consider the game's turn-based strategy and the interaction between Alice and Bob.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   The key to solving this problem is understanding that Alice and Bob are playing optimally. Alice will try to maximize the MEX by choosing elements that will delay the appearance of the smallest missing number, while Bob will try to minimize it by removing elements that could increase the MEX.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following test case:

```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice and Bob will pick elements in such a way that the MEX is maximized.
- If Alice and Bob play optimally, Alice can ensure that the array `c` will eventually contain all elements from `0` to `4`, making the MEX `5`.

**Actual Output of the Code:**
```
0
```

The code incorrectly returns `0` because it does not simulate the optimal play of the game.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game considering the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Here is a high-level outline of the correct approach:

1. **Count Frequencies:**
   Count the frequency of each element in the array.

2. **Simulate the Game:**
   Simulate the game turns where Alice and Bob pick elements based on their optimal strategies. Alice will try to maximize the MEX by choosing elements that will delay the appearance of the smallest missing number, while Bob will try to minimize it by removing elements that could increase the MEX.

3. **Calculate MEX:**
   After simulating the game, calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Given the complexity of simulating the game optimally, the provided code does not implement the correct logic, and thus it fails for certain test cases.
