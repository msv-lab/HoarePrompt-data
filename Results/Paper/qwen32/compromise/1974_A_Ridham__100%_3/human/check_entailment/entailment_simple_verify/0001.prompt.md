You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- A screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
- There are two types of applications:
  - 1x1 icons (each occupies 1 cell).
  - 2x2 icons (each occupies 4 cells).
- The task is to place all the icons on the minimum number of screens.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons `x` and 2x2 icons `y`.

2. **Calculating Space Requirements:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for 1x1 icons as `space_x = x * 1`.
   - The program calculates the total space required for 2x2 icons as `space_y = y * 4`.

3. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons as `screen_require_for_y`. This is done by dividing `y` by 2 and rounding up to the nearest integer.
     - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons as `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Placing 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If not, the program calculates the extra space needed as `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
   - It then calculates the additional screens required for the extra space. This is done by dividing `extra_space` by 15 and rounding up to the nearest integer.
     - If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen = extra_space // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`.
   - The total number of screens required is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of screens required for each test case.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program correctly calculates the number of screens required by first placing the 2x2 icons and then placing the 1x1 icons in the remaining space or additional screens if necessary.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1 (1 1):**
   - `space_x = 1`, `space_y = 4`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 1` (since `y=1` is odd)
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`
   - Since `space_x <= remaining_cells`, the number of screens required is `1`.

2. **Test Case 3 (12 4):**
   - `space_x = 12`, `space_y = 16`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 2` (since `y=4` is even)
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 16 = 14`
   - Since `space_x > remaining_cells`, the extra space needed is `12 - 14 = -2` (which is incorrect, but the logic should be `space_x - remaining_cells = 12 - 14 = -2`, but it's actually `12 - 14 = -2` but the logic should be `12 - 14 = 2` for the remaining cells to be filled, hence `extra_space = 2`)
   - `extra_screen = 2 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - The total number of screens required is `1 + 2 = 3` (However, the correct placement would be 2 screens, but the program logic seems to be correct in terms of calculation but incorrect in the example output).

However, the given output for the example is correct, which means the program logic is correct in terms of calculation and placement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
