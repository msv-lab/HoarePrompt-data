You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, it calculates the number of screens required based on the given logic and outputs the result for each test case on a new line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Program Analysis:

The program calculates the minimum number of screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.

#### Key Points:
1. **2x2 Icons Placement**:
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - The program calculates how many screens are needed just to accommodate the 2x2 icons.
   - If `y` is even, it requires `y // 2` screens.
   - If `y` is odd, it requires `y // 2 + 1` screens.

2. **Remaining Space**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
   - It then checks if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit into these remaining cells.
   - If the remaining cells are not enough, it calculates how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

#### Key Issues:
- **Handling Remaining Cells**: The program does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons in the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not consider all possible configurations of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Let's consider a test case where the program might fail:

**Test Case**:
```
1
8 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
1
```

**Explanation**:
- We have 1 2x2 icon and 8 1x1 icons.
- The 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- This leaves 11 cells on the screen.
- The 8 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining 11 cells.
- Therefore, only 1 screen is needed.

**Program Output**:
- The program might calculate that it needs 1 screen for the 2x2 icon.
- It then calculates that there are 11 remaining cells.
- Since 8 1x1 icons fit into 11 cells, it should conclude that 1 screen is sufficient.
- However, the program might not correctly handle the placement logic and might require an additional screen.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all configurations of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid. It might require additional logic to correctly place the icons and calculate the minimum number of screens needed.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly the placement of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.
