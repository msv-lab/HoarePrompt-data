Based on the provided initial state, the `result` list contains integers that have been populated through some logic within a loop. The variables `t` and `n` are mentioned to remain unchanged throughout the loop, but they are not directly involved in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is structured to join each element of the `result` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Each element of the `result` list is converted to a string using the `map(str, result)` function before joining.

Since the exact contents of the `result` list are not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of the `result` list's contents.

Output: **Each integer in the `result` list, separated by a newline character (where each integer is an element of the `result` list)**
