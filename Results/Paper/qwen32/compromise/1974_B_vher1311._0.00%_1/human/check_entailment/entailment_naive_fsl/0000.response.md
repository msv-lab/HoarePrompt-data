Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. The main issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to map each character in the encoded string back to its original character using the symmetric character from the sorted list of unique characters. However, the current implementation incorrectly modifies the string `s` while iterating over it, which leads to incorrect mappings.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Mapping Logic**: The function attempts to replace characters in the string `s` directly while iterating over it. This can lead to incorrect mappings because the string `s` is being modified during iteration, which affects subsequent iterations.

2. **Unnecessary Insertion in Unique Characters**: The code attempts to insert characters into the `unique_chars` list if they are not found, which is not necessary for decoding. The `unique_chars` list should only contain the distinct characters from the encoded string, sorted in alphabetical order.

3. **Incorrect Symmetric Character Replacement**: The function does not correctly map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character from the `unique_chars` list. Instead, it attempts to replace characters in the string `s` directly, which leads to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    return ''.join(char_map[char] for char in s)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)
```

In this corrected version:
- We create a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character.
- We then use this dictionary to decode the encoded string `s` by replacing each character with its mapped value.

This corrected version should work correctly for all test cases as per the problem description.
