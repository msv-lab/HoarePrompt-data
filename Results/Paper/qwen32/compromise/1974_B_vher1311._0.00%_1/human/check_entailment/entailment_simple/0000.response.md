Reasoning:  
The provided program logic for decoding the encoded string `b` is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to reverse the encoding process by mapping each character in the encoded string `b` back to its original character in the string `s`. However, the implementation of `func_1` does not achieve this goal.

Here are the key issues with the provided `func_1`:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The function attempts to replace each character in `s` with the corresponding character from `unique_chars` in reverse order. However, it does this by modifying the original string `s` directly within the loop, which is not only inefficient but also incorrect because it changes the string being iterated over. Additionally, the replacement logic does not correctly map each character to its symmetric character in `unique_chars`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**: The function incorrectly handles the list `unique_chars` by inserting characters into it when they are not found, which is not the intended behavior. The `unique_chars` list should only contain the distinct characters from the encoded string `b` in sorted order, and it should not be modified during the replacement process.

3. **Returning the Wrong Output**: The function returns the concatenation of `unique_chars` in reverse order, which does not correspond to the original string `s`. Instead, it should return a new string where each character in `b` is replaced by its symmetric character in `unique_chars`.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    return ''.join(char_map[char] for char in s)
```

**Explanation of the Corrected Function**:
- **unique_chars**: This list contains all unique characters from `s` in sorted order.
- **char_map**: This dictionary maps each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character.
- **Return Statement**: The function returns a new string where each character in `s` is replaced by its corresponding character in `char_map`.

Correctness: **False**
