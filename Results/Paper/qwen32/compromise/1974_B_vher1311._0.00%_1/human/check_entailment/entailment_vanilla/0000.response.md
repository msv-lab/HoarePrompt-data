Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
The task involves decoding a string `b` that has been encoded by replacing each character in the original string `s` with its symmetric character from a sorted string `r` of unique characters from `s`. To decode, we need to reverse this process.

### Program Analysis
The provided program seems to be attempting to decode the string `b` but contains logical errors.

1. **Unique Character Extraction and Sorting**:
   - The program correctly extracts unique characters from the string `b` and sorts them alphabetically. This part of the code is correct:
     ```python
     unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
     ```

2. **Mapping Characters Back**:
   - The program then attempts to replace each character in `s` (which should be `b` in this context) with characters from the `unique_chars` list in a symmetric manner. However, the approach is flawed:
     ```python
     (i, j) = (0, len(unique_chars) - 1)
     for char in s:
         if char in unique_chars:
             s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
             j -= 1
         else:
             unique_chars.insert(i, char)
             i += 1
             j += 1
     ```
   - The main issue here is that `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` replaces all occurrences of `char` in `s` with `unique_chars[j]` in each iteration, which is incorrect. It should replace each character only once based on its symmetric counterpart.
   - Additionally, the `else` block where `unique_chars.insert(i, char)` is executed is unnecessary and incorrect because all characters in `s` should already be in `unique_chars` since `unique_chars` is derived from `s`.

3. **Returning the Decoded String**:
   - The program attempts to return the joined `unique_chars` list, which is incorrect. It should construct the decoded string by mapping each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `unique_chars`.

### Correct Approach
To correctly decode the string, we need to:
1. Extract unique characters from `b` and sort them.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart.
3. Replace each character in `b` with its mapped character to get the original string `s`.

### Correctness
Given the issues in the provided program, it is incorrect for the task described.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
