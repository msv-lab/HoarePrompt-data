### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap
The task is to decode a string `b` that has been encoded by replacing each character in the original string `s` with its symmetric character from a sorted string `r` of unique characters from `s`. The decoding process involves reversing this symmetric mapping.

#### Provided Program Analysis

1. **Unique Character Extraction and Sorting**:
   - The program correctly extracts unique characters from the string `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
     ```python
     unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
     ```
   - This part is correct.

2. **Mapping Characters Back**:
   - The program then attempts to replace each character in `s` (which should be `b` in this context) with characters from the `unique_chars` list in a symmetric manner.
     ```python
     (i, j) = (0, len(unique_chars) - 1)
     for char in s:
         if char in unique_chars:
             s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
             j -= 1
         else:
             unique_chars.insert(i, char)
             i += 1
             j += 1
     ```
   - The main issue here is that `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` replaces all occurrences of `char` in `s` with `unique_chars[j]` in each iteration, which is incorrect. It should replace each character only once based on its symmetric counterpart.
   - Additionally, the `else` block where `unique_chars.insert(i, char)` is executed is unnecessary and incorrect because all characters in `s` (or `b`) should already be in `unique_chars` since `unique_chars` is derived from `s` (or `b`).

3. **Returning the Decoded String**:
   - The program attempts to return the joined `unique_chars` list, which is incorrect. It should construct the decoded string by mapping each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `unique_chars`.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly decode the string, we need to:
1. Extract unique characters from `b` and sort them.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart.
3. Replace each character in `b` with its mapped character to get the original string `s`.

#### Correct Implementation
Here is a correct implementation of the decoding process:

```python
def decode_string(b):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in b)
    return decoded_str

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)
```

#### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in replacing characters and the unnecessary `else` block. The correct approach involves creating a mapping from each character to its symmetric counterpart and then constructing the decoded string using this mapping.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
