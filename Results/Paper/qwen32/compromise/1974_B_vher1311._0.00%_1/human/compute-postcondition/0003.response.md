The provided code has a few issues that need to be addressed for it to function correctly. Specifically, the `for char in s:` loop iterates over the list `s`, but `s` is expected to be a list of strings, not a single string. Additionally, the `replace` method is being called on `s`, which is a list, not a string, which would cause an error.

Assuming the intention is to iterate over each character in each string within the list `s`, and to replace each character with the corresponding character from `unique_chars` in reverse order, the corrected code would look something like this:

```python
for idx, string in enumerate(s):
    new_string = ""
    for char in string:
        if char in unique_chars:
            new_string += unique_chars[j]
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
            new_string += char
    s[idx] = new_string
```

This corrected code iterates over each string in the list `s`, and for each character in the string, it checks if the character is in `unique_chars`. If it is, it replaces the character with the character at index `j` in `unique_chars` and decrements `j`. If the character is not in `unique_chars`, it inserts the character at index `i` in `unique_chars`, increments `i` and `j`, and keeps the character as is.

Given the initial state and the corrected code, the output state would be:

- The list `s` will have each character in the strings replaced by the characters in `unique_chars` in reverse order if they were present in `unique_chars` initially. If a character was not in `unique_chars`, it will be added to `unique_chars` and kept in the string.
- The list `unique_chars` will have all unique characters from the strings in `s` in the order they were first encountered, with new characters added to the beginning as they are found.

Since the exact strings in `s` and the initial `unique_chars` are not provided, we can't specify the exact output state. However, we can describe the general transformation:

Output State: **The list `s` will have characters replaced by those in `unique_chars` in reverse order if they were present initially, and new characters will be added to `unique_chars` and kept in `s`. The list `unique_chars` will contain all unique characters from `s` in the order they were first encountered, with new characters added to the beginning.**
