The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will now hold the value 1.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1; `i` is 1**.
