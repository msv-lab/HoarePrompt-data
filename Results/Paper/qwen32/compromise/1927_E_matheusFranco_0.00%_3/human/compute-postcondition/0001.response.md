To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `t > 0` evaluates to `True`. The only variable involved in this condition is `t`.

Given that `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, we need to adjust `t` such that it is greater than 0.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the variable in the loop condition**: The variable `t` is the only one involved in the loop condition `t > 0`.
2. **Determine the necessary condition**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that it is set to a value greater than 0.

Therefore, the state should be modified to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
