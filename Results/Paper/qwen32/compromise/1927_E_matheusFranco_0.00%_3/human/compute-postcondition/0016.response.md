The given code modifies the `permutation` list by setting the value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to `curr_v`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
- `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 1 and the element at index `k` set to 2.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is 3.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k`.

The line of code `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v` sets the element at index `2 * k` in the `permutation` list to `3`.

Therefore, the updated `permutation` list will have:
- The first element as 1.
- The element at index `k` as 2.
- The element at index `2 * k` as 3.

All other elements in the `permutation` list remain 0.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 1, the element at index `k` set to 2, and the element at index `2 * k` set to 3; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k`.**
