To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
- `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with specific elements set to certain values.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 4`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 2*k`.
- `i` is 1.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_i`.

Since the loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than `n` (the length of the `permutation` list).

At the end of the previous iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 2*k`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `1 + 2*k` should be less than `n`.

However, since the problem specifies that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even, and given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at `1 + 2*k`, it is already set up correctly based on the provided conditions. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to `multiples_of_k_plus_i` as long as `n` and `k` satisfy the given constraints.

Thus, the state remains the same for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`, except the element at index 1 is `floor((n-1)/k) + 2` and the element at index `1 + k` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 3`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 4`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 2*k`; `i` is 1**
