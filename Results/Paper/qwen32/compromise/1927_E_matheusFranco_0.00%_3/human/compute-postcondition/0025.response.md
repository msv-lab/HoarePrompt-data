The code snippet increments the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by the value of `k`. Given the initial state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 1, and `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n`.

After executing the line `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k`, the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `1 + k`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`, except the element at index 1 is `floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`; `i` is 1.**
