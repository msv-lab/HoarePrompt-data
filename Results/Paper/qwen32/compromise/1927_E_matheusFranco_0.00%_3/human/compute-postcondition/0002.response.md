To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine its impact on the variables. However, based on the given information, we can only confirm that `t` must still be greater than 0 after the function call, as no changes to `t` are specified.

If `func_1()` does not modify `t` or any other variables mentioned, the output state would simply reflect that `t` remains greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.
