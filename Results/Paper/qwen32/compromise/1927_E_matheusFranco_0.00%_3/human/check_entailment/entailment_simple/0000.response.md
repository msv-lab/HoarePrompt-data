### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem requirements step-by-step to determine if the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Permutation Definition**: A permutation of length \( n \) is an array of \( n \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \).
2. **k-Level Permutation**: A permutation is k-level if the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length \( k \) is at most 1.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads \( n \) and \( k \) for the current test case.
   - Initializes a permutation list of length \( n \) with zeros.
   - Uses a loop to fill the permutation list:
     - For each index \( i \) from 0 to \( k-1 \):
       - Fills every \( k \)-th position starting from \( i \) with the next available value (starting from 1).
   - Prints the resulting permutation as a space-separated string.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the second test case from the example:
- **Input**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 2 \)
- **Desired Output**: Any permutation where the sums of all continuous segments of length 2 differ by at most 1.
- **Generated Output**: `1 3 2`
  - Sums of segments of length 2: 
    - \( p_1 + p_2 = 1 + 3 = 4 \)
    - \( p_2 + p_3 = 3 + 2 = 5 \)
  - Difference: \( 5 - 4 = 1 \), which satisfies the condition.

However, let's consider another example to see if the pattern holds:
- **Input**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 2 \)
- **Generated Output**: `1 3 2 4`
  - Sums of segments of length 2:
    - \( p_1 + p_2 = 1 + 3 = 4 \)
    - \( p_2 + p_3 = 3 + 2 = 5 \)
    - \( p_3 + p_4 = 2 + 4 = 6 \)
  - Difference: \( 6 - 4 = 2 \), which does not satisfy the condition.

From this example, it's clear that the generated permutation does not always meet the k-level condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not guarantee that the generated permutation will be k-level for all possible values of \( n \) and \( k \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
