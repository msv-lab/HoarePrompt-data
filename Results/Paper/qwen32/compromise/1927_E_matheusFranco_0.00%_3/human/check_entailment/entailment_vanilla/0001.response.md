To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it constructs a k-level permutation for each test case as per the problem description. Let's break down the logic of the provided code and compare it with the requirements.

### Code Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `permutation` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It also initializes `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` to 1. However, `idx` and `idx_v` are not used in the function.

2. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The function iterates over `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
   - For each `i`, it fills the permutation at indices `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which starts at `i` and increments by `k` each time) with the current value `curr_v` and then increments `curr_v`.

3. **Printing the Result**:
   - After filling the permutation, it joins the elements into a string separated by spaces and prints the result.

### Verification Against Requirements

The goal is to create a k-level permutation where the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any k-length contiguous subarray is at most 1.

Let's consider how the current implementation attempts to achieve this:

- The approach fills the permutation in a pattern where every `k`-th position starting from `i` (for `i` from 0 to `k-1`) is filled sequentially with increasing numbers.
- This means the permutation will look something like this for `n=10` and `k=4`:
  - Starting from index 0: 1, 5, 9, ...
  - Starting from index 1: 2, 6, 10, ...
  - Starting from index 2: 3, 7, 11, ...
  - Starting from index 3: 4, 8, 12, ...

However, this pattern does not necessarily ensure that the sums of any k-length contiguous subarrays differ by no more than 1. For instance, in the example provided, the sums of the subarrays might vary significantly depending on the distribution of numbers.

### Conclusion

Given the pattern of filling the permutation, it is not guaranteed that the sums of all k-length contiguous subarrays will have a difference of at most 1. Therefore, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
