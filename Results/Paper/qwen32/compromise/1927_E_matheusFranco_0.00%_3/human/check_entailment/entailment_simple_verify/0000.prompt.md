You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Generates a permutation for a given pair of `n` and `k`.
2. `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

### Problem Description Recap

We need to generate a `k`-level permutation of length `n` such that among all sums of continuous segments of length `k`, any two sums differ by no more than 1.

### Code Review

#### Function `func_1()`

The function `func_1()` generates a permutation by distributing values in a specific pattern:
- It initializes an array `permutation` of size `n` with zeros.
- It iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `k-1`.
- For each `i`, it places values starting from `1` at positions `i`, `i+k`, `i+2k`, etc., until it reaches the end of the array.

This distribution ensures that the sums of any `k` consecutive elements will be close to each other, but we need to verify if this pattern guarantees that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any `k`-length segment is at most 1.

#### Function `func_2()`

The function `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case. This part of the code is straightforward and follows the problem description.

### Testing the Pattern

Let's consider a few test cases to see if the pattern works as intended:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 2, k = 2`
   - The generated permutation is `[1, 2]`.
   - Sum of the segment `[1, 2]` is `3`.
   - Difference between max and min sum is `0`.

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3, k = 2`
   - The generated permutation is `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - Sums of segments `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are `3` and `5`, respectively.
   - Difference between max and min sum is `2`. This violates the condition.

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 10, k = 4`
   - The generated permutation is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
   - Sums of segments `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `[2, 3, 4, 5]`, ..., `[7, 8, 9, 10]` are `10`, `14`, `18`, `22`, `26`, `30`, `34`, and `37`, respectively.
   - Difference between max and min sum is `27`. This violates the condition.

From these test cases, it is clear that the current pattern does not guarantee that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any `k`-length segment is at most 1.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, the pattern used to generate the permutation does not ensure that the sums of any `k` consecutive elements differ by no more than 1.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation

The pattern used in `func_1()` does not guarantee that the sums of any `k` consecutive elements in the permutation will differ by no more than 1. As shown in the test cases, the sums can vary significantly, violating the condition specified in the problem description.
