Output State: **The program returns `total_max_segment`. If `total_max_segment` has a length of 1, then it is `[-1]`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the program returns `total_max_segment`, which is either `[-1]` if it initially had a length of 1, or it returns `total_max_segment` as it is if it had a different length.
