The code snippet `total_max_segment = [-1]` assigns a new list `[-1]` to the variable `total_max_segment`. This change does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is [sum of the last segment, end index of the last segment]; `segments_variants` is a list of all considered segments including the new segment `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `[len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` is -1; `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.**
