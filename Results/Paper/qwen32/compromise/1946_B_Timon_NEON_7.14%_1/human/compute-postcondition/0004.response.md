The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it depends on the length of the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element. The initial state of `i` does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts since `i` is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head. However, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element to make sure the loop can execute.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is [0, 0]; `segments_variants` is an empty list; `max_sum` is -1**
