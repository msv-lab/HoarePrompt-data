The code snippet provided is:
```
minn = min(minn, same)
```

This line of code assigns the variable `minn` the minimum value between its current value and the value of `same`. Given the initial state, we do not have specific values for `minn` and `same`, but we know that `minn` will be updated to the smaller of these two values.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, and `num`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 6 elements, `i` is either 4 or 5 or 6, `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum value between its previous value and `same`.**
