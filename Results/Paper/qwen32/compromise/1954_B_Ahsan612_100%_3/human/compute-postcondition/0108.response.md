The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to be equal to the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. Given that `i` is 4, `num` will now hold the value of `ar[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 4 elements, `_` is `k + 1`, `i` is 4, `same` is 3, `minn` is `inf`, and `num` is `ar[4]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `num` has been updated to the value of the 5th element in the list `ar` (since list indexing starts at 0), and all other variables remain unchanged.
