Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 6 elements, `i` is either 4 or 5 or 6 or 7. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is either 5 or 6 or 7, `num` is set to `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.**

In natural language, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `same` remain unchanged unless a subsequent condition changes them.
