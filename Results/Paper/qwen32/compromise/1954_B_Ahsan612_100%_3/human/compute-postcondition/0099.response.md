The code increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, if `i` was 2, it becomes 3, and if `i` was 3, it becomes 4. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 4 elements, `_` is `k + 1`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 3, `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 4, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, and `minn` is 1.**
