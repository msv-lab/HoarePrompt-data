The code snippet updates the value of `minn` by taking the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given the initial state, `minn` is initially `inf` and `same` is `1`. After the execution of the code, `minn` will be `1` because `1` is less than `inf`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, and `_` is `k + 1`.**
