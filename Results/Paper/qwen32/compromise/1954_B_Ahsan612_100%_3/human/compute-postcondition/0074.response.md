The code snippet updates the variable `minn` by comparing it with the value of `same` and assigning the smaller of the two to `minn`. This means that `minn` will now hold the minimum value between its previous value and the current value of `same`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements, `num` is the last unique element encountered in the list, and `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of identical elements encountered in the list, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `same`.**
