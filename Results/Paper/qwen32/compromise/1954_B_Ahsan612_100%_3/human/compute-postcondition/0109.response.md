The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` compares the current value of `minn` with the value of `same` and assigns the smaller of the two to `minn`. Given that `minn` is initially `inf` (infinity) and `same` is 3, the result of the comparison will be 3, since 3 is smaller than infinity.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 4 elements, `_` is `k + 1`, `i` is 4, `same` is 3, `minn` is 3, and `num` is `ar[4]`.**
