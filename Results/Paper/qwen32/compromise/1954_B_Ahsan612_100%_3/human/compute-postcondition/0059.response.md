The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` is either 2 or 3, after the increment, `i` will be either 3 or 4. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4**.
