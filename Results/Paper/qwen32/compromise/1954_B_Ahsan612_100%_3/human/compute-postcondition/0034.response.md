The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. This means that if `same` is less than `minn`, `minn` will take the value of `same`. If `same` is greater than or equal to `minn`, `minn` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is the count of the last consecutive elements in `ar` that were equal, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`, `num` is the last unique element in `ar`.**
