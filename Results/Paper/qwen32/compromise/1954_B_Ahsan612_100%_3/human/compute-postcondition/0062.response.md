Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` is 3, or `ar[4]` if `i` is 4, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`, `same` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is set to 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.
