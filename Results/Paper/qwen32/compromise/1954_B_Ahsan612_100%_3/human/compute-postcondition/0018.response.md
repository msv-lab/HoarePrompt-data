Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `same` is 3 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 2 otherwise, `num` is `ar[2]` if `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, `minn` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `same` was initially 2, it becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
