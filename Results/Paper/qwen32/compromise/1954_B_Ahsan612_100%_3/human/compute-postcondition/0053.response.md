The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` compares the current value of `minn` (which is initially set to infinity) with the value of `same` (which is 1). Since `same` (1) is less than `minn` (infinity), `minn` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1.**
