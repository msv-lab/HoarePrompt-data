To determine the final output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables `i`, `same`, `num`, and `minn`.

### Loop Behavior Analysis:
- **Initialization:**
  - `i` is initialized to 1.
  - `same` is initialized to 1.
  - `num` is initialized to the first element of `ar`.
  - `minn` is initialized to infinity.

- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop runs while `i < len(ar)`.
  - If `ar[i] == num`, `same` is incremented by 1.
  - If `ar[i] != num`, `i` is incremented by 1, `num` is updated to `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.
  - Regardless of the condition, `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

### Final State Determination:
- The loop will iterate through the entire list `ar` until `i` reaches `len(ar)`.
- `num` will hold the last unique element encountered in the list.
- `same` will hold the count of the last sequence of identical elements.
- `minn` will hold the minimum count of any sequence of identical elements encountered in the list.
- `i` will be equal to `len(ar)` after the loop completes.

### Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `ar` remains unchanged as it is only read in the loop.
- `i` will be equal to `len(ar)`.
- `same` will be the count of the last sequence of identical elements.
- `num` will be the last unique element encountered in the list.
- `minn` will be the minimum count of any sequence of identical elements encountered in the list.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements, `num` is the last unique element encountered in the list, and `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of identical elements encountered in the list.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be the length of the list `ar`. `same` will indicate how many times the last unique number in the list appears consecutively. `num` will be the last unique number encountered in the list, and `minn` will be the smallest number of times any consecutive identical numbers appeared in the list.
