The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Based on the initial state, if `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `i` was 1, and after the increment, `i` becomes 2. If `ar[i]` was not equal to `num`, then `i` was 2, and after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num` before the increment, then `i` is 2, `same` is 2, and `minn` is infinity. Otherwise, `i` is 3, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, and `minn` is 1.**
