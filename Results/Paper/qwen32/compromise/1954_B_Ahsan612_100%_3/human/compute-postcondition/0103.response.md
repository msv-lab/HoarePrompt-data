Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 4 elements, `_` is `k + 1`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 2, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 3 or 4, `same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of its initial value and `same`, and `num` is `ar[3]` or `ar[4]`.**
