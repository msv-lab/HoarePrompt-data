Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is `inf`, and `_` is `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `minn` is explicitly set to `inf` by the code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not affected by the code.
