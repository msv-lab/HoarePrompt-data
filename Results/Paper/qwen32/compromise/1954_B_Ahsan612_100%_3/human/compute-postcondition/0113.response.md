To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the given initial and intermediate states.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `num` is `ar[0]`.
   - `minn` is `inf`.
   - `_` is `k + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs while `i < len(ar)`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `ar[i] == num`, then `same` is incremented by 1.
   - If `ar[i] != num`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `num` is updated to `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.
   - Regardless of the condition, `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

### Iteration Analysis:
- **First Iteration:**
  - If `ar[1] == ar[0]`, then `same` becomes 2, `i` becomes 2.
  - If `ar[1] != ar[0]`, then `i` becomes 3, `num` becomes `ar[2]`, `minn` becomes 1, `same` becomes 1.

- **Second Iteration:**
  - If `ar[2] == ar[1]`, then `same` becomes 2, `i` becomes 3.
  - If `ar[2] != ar[1]`, then `i` becomes 4, `num` becomes `ar[3]`, `minn` becomes the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `same` becomes 1.

- **Third Iteration:**
  - If `ar[3] == ar[2]`, then `same` becomes 2, `i` becomes 4.
  - If `ar[3] != ar[2]`, then `i` becomes 5, `num` becomes `ar[4]`, `minn` becomes the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `same` becomes 1.

### General Behavior:
- The loop continues until `i` reaches the length of `ar`.
- `same` counts the number of consecutive elements equal to `num`.
- `minn` keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive elements that were the same during the loop's execution.

### Final State:
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `len(ar)`.
- `num` will be the last unique element encountered in the list.
- `same` will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements.
- `minn` will be the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements found in the list.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements, `num` is the last unique element encountered in the list, `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements found in the list, `_` is `k + 1`.**

In natural language, the final state means that the loop has processed the entire list `ar`, and the variables `i`, `same`, `num`, and `minn` reflect the final counts and values after the loop has completed its execution.
