Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the program is flawed because it only calculates the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same and checks if removing that many elements would make the array stop being beautiful, which is not the correct approach.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to consider the structure of the array and how the operation affects it. The key is to identify the longest contiguous subsequence of the same elements and determine if removing elements from this subsequence can make the array stop being beautiful.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the longest contiguous subsequence of the same elements
        max_len = 1
        current_len = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ar[i] == ar[i - 1]:
                current_len += 1
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
                current_len = 1
        max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
        
        # If the whole array is the same, we can't make it stop being beautiful
        if max_len == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # The minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest contiguous subsequence minus 2
            print(max(1, max_len - 2))

func()
```

This corrected version finds the longest contiguous subsequence of the same elements and determines the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition. If the entire array is the same, it outputs `-1` as it is impossible to make it stop being beautiful.
