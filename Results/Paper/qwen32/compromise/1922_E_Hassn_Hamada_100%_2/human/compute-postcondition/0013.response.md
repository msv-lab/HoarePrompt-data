To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `size` and `i`. The condition for the loop to execute is:

\[
(1 << \text{size} + 1) - (1 << \text{i}) \leq \text{number}
\]

Given the current state:
- `number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000)
- `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18)
- `size_overlap` is `(0, 0)`
- `size` is 3
- `i` is 1
- `value` is 6

We need to check the current condition with the given values:

\[
(1 << 3 + 1) - (1 << 1) = (1 << 4) - (1 << 1) = 16 - 2 = 14
\]

So the condition becomes:

\[
14 \leq \text{number}
\]

For the loop to execute again, `number` must be at least 14. Since `number` is given to be between 1 and 1000, we need to ensure that `number` is at least 14. No other states need to be adjusted as only `size` and `i` are in the loop head.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to ensure `number` is at least 14.

State: **`number` must be at least 14, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `size_overlap` is `(0, 0)`, `size` is 3, `i` is 1, `value` is 6**
