Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > number, `value` is (1 << size) - 1, `size_overlap` is a tuple (`size`, `i`) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language description: The values of `size`, `value`, and `size_overlap` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
