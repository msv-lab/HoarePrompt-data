Output State: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `size_overlap` is (10, 1), `size` is 10, `i` is 1, `value` is 1022, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
