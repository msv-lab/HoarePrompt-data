The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or control structure it is in. Therefore, none of the variables `size`, `value`, `sequence`, `i`, or `size_overlap` are affected by the `break` statement.

Output State: **`size` is `previous_i + n`, `value` is `2^(previous_i + n) - 2^(previous_i - 1)` and is less than or equal to `number`, `sequence` is unchanged, `i` is `previous_i - 1`, `size_overlap` is (`previous_i + n`, `previous_i - 1`) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
