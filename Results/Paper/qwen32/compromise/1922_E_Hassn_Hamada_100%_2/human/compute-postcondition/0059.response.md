The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `size - overlap`. If `i` is less than `size - overlap`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 2`.

Given this, for the loop to execute one more time, `i + 2` must be less than `size - overlap`. Therefore, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i + 2`.

State: **`sequence` is a list with an additional element `i + overlap` appended to it, `i` is `i + 2`** 

However, to ensure clarity and correctness, we need to reflect the updated value of `i` for the next iteration:

State: **`sequence` is a list with an additional element `i + overlap` appended to it, `i` is `i + 2` (which means `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 2)**

To make it explicit:

If `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 2`.

State: **`sequence` is a list with an additional element `i + overlap` appended to it, `i` is `i + 2`**

Given that `i` was `i + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be `(i + 2) + 2` which simplifies to `i + 4` (considering `i` from the perspective of the start of the next iteration).

State: **`sequence` is a list with an additional element `i + overlap` appended to it, `i` is `i + 2`**

But to reflect the next iteration correctly:

State: **`sequence` is a list with an additional element `i + overlap` appended to it, `i` is `i + 4`**
