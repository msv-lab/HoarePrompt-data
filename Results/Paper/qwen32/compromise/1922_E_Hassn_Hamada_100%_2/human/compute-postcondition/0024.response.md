Output State: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000 and number must be at least 3), `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `size` is 2, `i` is 0, `value` is 1.**

The value of `size` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
