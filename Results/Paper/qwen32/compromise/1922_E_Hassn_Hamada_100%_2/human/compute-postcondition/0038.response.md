The code snippet updates the values of `size` and `value` based on the current value of `i`. Here's the breakdown:

- `size` is updated to `i + 1`.
- `value` is updated to `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`, which simplifies to `2^i`.

Given the initial state, `i` is `previous_i - 1`. After the code execution, `size` becomes `previous_i` and `value` becomes `2^(previous_i - 1)`.

Output State: **`size` is `previous_i`, `value` is `2^(previous_i - 1)`, `sequence` is unchanged, `i` is `previous_i - 1`**.
