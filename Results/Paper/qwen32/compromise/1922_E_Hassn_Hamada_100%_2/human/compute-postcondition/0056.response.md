The code snippet provided is `sequence.append(i + overlap)`. This line of code appends the result of `i + overlap` to the list `sequence`.

Given the initial state, we know that `sequence` is a list, and `i` and `overlap` are variables whose specific values are not provided. The only change that occurs is that `sequence` will now include an additional element, which is the sum of `i` and `overlap`.

Output State: **`sequence` is a list with an additional element `i + overlap` appended to it.**
