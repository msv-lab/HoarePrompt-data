Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Function `func_1` is not correctly defined or used**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence, but it returns a tuple `(0, 0)` in the base case, which is not used correctly.
   - The function modifies the `sequence` list in place and returns `None`, but the return values `(0, 0)` are not utilized anywhere in the code.

2. **Incorrect handling of the base case**:
   - When `number == 0`, the function returns `(0, 0)`, but this return value is not used or handled correctly in the calling code. The base case should directly append the necessary elements to the sequence or handle the termination condition properly.

3. **Incorrect logic for generating the sequence**:
   - The logic inside the loop for calculating `size` and `value` seems incorrect and does not guarantee that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The loop condition and the way `size` and `value` are calculated do not align with the problem requirements.

4. **Incorrect handling of the input `X`**:
   - The input `X` is directly used as `n - 1` in the `func_1` call, which is not consistent with the problem requirements.
   - The function `func_1` is expected to generate a sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
For the input `X = 2`, the program might generate an incorrect sequence. The correct output for `X = 2` should be an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences, such as `[0]` or `[0 1]`. However, the provided program might generate an incorrect sequence that does not meet this requirement.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the logic and handling of the sequence generation, the program does not correctly generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
