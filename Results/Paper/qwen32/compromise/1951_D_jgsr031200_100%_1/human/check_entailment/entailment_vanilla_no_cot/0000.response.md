Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is incorrect and does not consider the possibility of setting up multiple stalls with different prices to achieve the desired number of jewels purchased.

Here are the issues with the provided code:

1. The logic for determining the prices and the number of stalls is incorrect. The code only considers two prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`) and does not attempt to use up to 60 different prices to achieve the desired number of jewels.

2. The function does not handle the case where more than two stalls are needed to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels.

3. The code does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought by Alice is exactly `k`.

To solve the problem correctly, Bob can set up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, starting from `2^0` up to `2^59`. This allows Bob to make Alice buy any number of jewels up to `2^60 - 1` by choosing appropriate prices. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^60 - 1`, it is always possible to set up the stalls correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k > (1 << 60) - 1:  # 2^60 - 1
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        prices = []
        remaining = k
        power = 0
        while remaining > 0:
            if remaining % 2 == 1:
                prices.append(1 << power)  # 2^power
            remaining //= 2
            power += 1
        print(len(prices))
        print(*prices)
```

This corrected version ensures that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with prices that are powers of 2, allowing Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
