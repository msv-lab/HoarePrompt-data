Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Bob wants to set up at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels from Bob's store. Each stall has a price per jewel, and Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall in sequence until she has bought `k` jewels.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - Alice has `n` coins.
   - Alice wants `k` jewels.
   - There are at most 60 stalls.
   - Each stall's price per jewel is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (Alice's coins) and `k` (desired number of jewels).

2. **Logic to Determine Stall Prices**:
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES" with 1 stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than jewels.
   - If `n > k`, it initializes a list `costs` with two prices: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall using integer division and checks if the total number of jewels bought is at least `k`.
   - If the total number of jewels bought is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the two prices in `costs`.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Stall Pricing Strategy**:
   - The current strategy of using only two stall prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`) is too simplistic and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The code does not explore different combinations of stall prices to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The logic for calculating the number of jewels bought from each stall does not account for the possibility of using more than two stalls or different stall prices.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `k` is very large relative to `n` or where `n` is very large relative to `k`.
   - It does not consider the possibility of using up to 60 stalls with different prices to achieve the exact number of jewels `k`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. It fails to explore the full range of possible stall prices and numbers of stalls to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

**Correctness: False**
