The given initial state describes the values of `n` and `k` as positive integers where both are equal to each other. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference these variables. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`, the output will be the constant value `1`.

Output: **1**
