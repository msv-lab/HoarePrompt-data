Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and each element `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from standard input; `idx` is 2; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
