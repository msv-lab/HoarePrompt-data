The function accepts a list `a` of positive integers with a length `n` such that 2 <= n <= 50. It checks if any contiguous subsequence of length `n` in the doubled list `a + a` matches the sorted version of `a`. If such a subsequence is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. However, based on the provided return postcondition, the function always returns 'No'.
