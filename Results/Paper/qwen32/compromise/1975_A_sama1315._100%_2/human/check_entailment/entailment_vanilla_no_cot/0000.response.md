To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly solves the problem described.

The problem requires determining whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing some number of operations where an operation consists of splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping these two parts.

The provided solution works as follows:
1. It creates a sorted version of the array to know what the target sorted array looks like.
2. It concatenates the original array with itself, which simulates all possible rotations of the array by splitting and swapping.
3. It then checks if any subarray of length `n` (the original array length) within this concatenated array matches the sorted array.

This approach is valid because concatenating the array with itself essentially simulates all possible rotations and splits of the array. If any rotation of the array matches the sorted version of the array, then it is possible to sort the array using the allowed operations.

Let's consider the example given in the problem statement to verify:

- For the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, the concatenated array is `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. None of the subarrays of length 6 match the sorted array `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`, so the output is "No".
- For the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, the concatenated array is `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`. The subarray `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2]` when rotated can become `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` which is not the sorted array, but the subarray `[2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2]` when rotated can become `[2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` which is not the sorted array either. However, the subarray `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` is a part of the concatenated array and can be rotated to become the sorted array `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` when the other part is `[2]`, so the output is "Yes".
- For the array `[1, 2, 3]`, the concatenated array is `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`. The subarray `[1, 2, 3]` matches the sorted array, so the output is "Yes".

Thus, the program correctly determines whether the array can be sorted using the allowed operations.

Your response:
Correctness: **True**
