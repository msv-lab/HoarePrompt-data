You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers, and n is the length of the list a such that 2 <= n <= 50.
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
        
    #State: the function returns 'Yes'.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` of positive integers with a length `n` such that 2 <= n <= 50. It checks if any contiguous subsequence of length `n` in the doubled list `a + a` matches the sorted version of `a`. If such a subsequence is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. However, based on the provided return postcondition, the function always returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n positive integers, where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. Each element a_i in a satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        result = func_1(a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `a` is the last list of integers processed in the loop, `data` remains unchanged, `idx` is incremented by the total number of integers processed plus `t`, `t` remains the same, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: Each element of the `results` list, separated by newline characters (where each element is the result of `func_1(a)` for each iteration)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it processes the list using the function `func_1` and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into two parts and swapping them. The key insight here is that the array can be rotated to achieve a sorted order if and only if there exists a point in the array where it can be split into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part is sorted.

The provided solution uses a clever trick to check this condition. It concatenates the array with itself (`concatenated_a = a + a`) and then checks if any subarray of length `n` (the original array length) within this concatenated array is sorted. If such a subarray exists, it indicates that the original array can be rotated to become sorted.

Let's break down the steps of the provided solution:

1. **Concatenation**: The array `a` is concatenated with itself to form `concatenated_a`. This allows us to easily check for any possible rotation of the array.
2. **Checking Subarrays**: The code then iterates over all possible starting points of subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a` and checks if any of these subarrays match the sorted version of `a`.
3. **Output**: If a matching subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

This approach works because any rotation of the array can be represented as a subarray of length `n` in the concatenated array `concatenated_a`.

### Correctness:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic needed to determine if the array can be sorted by rotating it. It efficiently checks all possible rotations by leveraging array concatenation and subarray comparison.

Therefore, the correctness of the solution is:

Correctness: **True**
