### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight that an array can be rotated to achieve a sorted order if and only if there exists a point in the array where it can be split into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part is sorted. The provided solution uses the concatenation trick to efficiently check all possible rotations of the array.

Let's break down the provided solution again to ensure its correctness:

1. **Concatenation**: The array `a` is concatenated with itself to form `concatenated_a`. This allows us to easily check for any possible rotation of the array.
2. **Checking Subarrays**: The code then iterates over all possible starting points of subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a` and checks if any of these subarrays match the sorted version of `a`.
3. **Output**: If a matching subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

This approach is sound and correct. Here is a detailed explanation of why:

- **Concatenation**: By concatenating the array with itself, we can simulate all possible rotations of the array within a single, larger array. For example, if `a = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`, then `concatenated_a = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. Any rotation of `a` can be found as a subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a`.
  
- **Checking Subarrays**: By iterating over all possible starting points of subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a`, we ensure that we check every possible rotation of the array. For each starting point `i`, the subarray `concatenated_a[i:i+n]` represents a rotation of the original array `a`.

- **Comparison with Sorted Array**: If any of these subarrays match the sorted version of `a`, it means that the array can be rotated to become sorted, and the function returns "Yes". If no such subarray is found, the function returns "No".

The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution is correct and efficiently checks if the array can be sorted by rotating it. The original assessment accurately evaluates the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
