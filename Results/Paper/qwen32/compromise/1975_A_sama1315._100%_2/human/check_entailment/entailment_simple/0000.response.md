### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts (a prefix and a suffix) and then the two parts are swapped. The key observation here is that if the array can be split into two parts such that the concatenation of the suffix and prefix results in a sorted array, then the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, the answer is "No".

The provided program follows this logic:
1. It first reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. It then calls `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation.
4. In `func_1`, it creates a sorted version of the array and a concatenated version of the array with itself.
5. It checks if any subarray of length `n` (the original array length) in the concatenated array matches the sorted array. If it does, it means that a valid split exists, and it returns "Yes". If no such subarray is found, it returns "No".

This approach is correct because:
- By concatenating the array with itself, we can simulate all possible rotations of the array that can be achieved through the described operation.
- Checking if any subarray of length `n` in this concatenated array matches the sorted array ensures that we are checking all possible valid splits.
