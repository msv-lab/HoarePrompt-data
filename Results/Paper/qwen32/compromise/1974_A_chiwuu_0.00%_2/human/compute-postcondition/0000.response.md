The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a specific range and that for each of the `t` test cases, `x` and `y` are integers within a specific range. These preconditions remain unchanged by the provided code snippet, except for the introduction of the new variable `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is an input integer.**
