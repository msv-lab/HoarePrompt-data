Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the given problem. Let's analyze the code and find a case where it fails.

The main logic in the code is as follows:
1. Calculate the total number of cells required for 2x2 icons (`t = b * 2`).
2. Calculate the number of screens needed for these 2x2 icons (`t = t // 5 + 1` if `t % 5 != 0`).
3. Calculate the remaining cells available after placing the 2x2 icons (`t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`).
4. If the remaining cells are enough to place the 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), then no additional screens are needed.
5. Otherwise, calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Let's consider a specific test case:
```
Input:
1
14 0

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output:
3
```

Explanation for the test case:
- We have 14 1x1 icons and 0 2x2 icons.
- The code calculates `t = 0 * 2 = 0`, so `t = 0` screens are needed for 2x2 icons.
- The remaining cells available are `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
- Since `t1 < 14`, the code calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: `t2 = 14 - 0 = 14`.
- The number of additional screens needed is `t2 // 15 + 1 = 14 // 15 + 1 = 1`, so the total number of screens is `0 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.

However, the correct answer should be 2 screens, as 14 1x1 icons can be placed on 2 screens (each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons).

Thus, the code does not handle all cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
