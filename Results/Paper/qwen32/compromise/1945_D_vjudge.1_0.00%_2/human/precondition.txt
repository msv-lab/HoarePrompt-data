Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of people in the queue (excluding Kirill) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where a_i is the number of coins Kirill has to pay to swap places with the i-th person. The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) where b_i is the number of coins Kirill has to pay to each person between the swapped positions. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
