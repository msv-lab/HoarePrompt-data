You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
Kirill is in a queue of `n` people and wants to move to one of the first `m` positions by bribing people ahead of him. For each person `i`, he can bribe them to swap places, paying `a_i` coins. Additionally, for each person `k` between `i` and Kirill's current position, he must pay `b_k` coins. The goal is to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()` processes a single test case.
2. `func_2()` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one.

Let's break down `func_1()`:

1. **Input Reading and Reversing:**
   - The function reads `n` (number of people in the queue) and `k` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill, adjusted to `n - k` for easier processing).
   - It reads two lists, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which represent the `a_i` and `b_i` values respectively.
   - Both lists are reversed. This reversal might be intended to make it easier to process the queue from the end towards the beginning, but it introduces complications.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - `soma_b` accumulates the cost of bribing people between `i` and Kirill's current position.
   - `pref` accumulates the total cost incurred so far.
   - The loop iterates over the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists.
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it means bribing person `i` directly is cheaper than moving through them. Thus, the accumulated `soma_b` is added to `pref`, and `lista_A[i]` is added to `pref`. `soma_b` is reset to 0.
     - Otherwise, `lista_B[i]` is added to `soma_b`.
   - After the loop, `resultado` is set to infinity, and another loop runs from `n - k` to `n`.
     - For each position `i` in this range, `resultado` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`.
     - `soma_b` is incremented by `lista_B[i]` after each iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - The final `resultado` is printed, representing the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Issues in the Solution:
- **Reversing the Lists:** The reversal of `lista_A` and `lista_B` complicates the logic. The problem description assumes a forward queue, and reversing the lists can lead to incorrect calculations, especially when considering the indices and the logic of `soma_b` and `pref`.
- **Logic for Cost Calculation:** The logic for calculating the minimum cost seems flawed. The direct comparison between `lista_A[i]` and `lista_B[i]` without considering the cumulative cost of previous bribes can lead to incorrect results.
- **Handling of `pref` and `soma_b`:** The accumulation of `pref` and `soma_b` does not correctly reflect the cost structure described in the problem. The cumulative cost should be calculated in a way that respects the order of people in the queue and the incremental costs of bribing each person.

### Conclusion:
Given the above issues, the provided solution is not correct. It does not accurately compute the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
