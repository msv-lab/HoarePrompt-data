Reasoning: 

The provided code is designed to solve the problem described, where Kirill needs to bribe people to move up the queue while minimizing the number of coins spent. The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. `func_1` handles the logic for a single test case. It reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `k` (renamed as `m` in the problem description). It then reads two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B` which represent the costs associated with bribing people and the additional costs for people who get bribed between the two positions, respectively.

2. The function reverses both `lista_A` and `lista_B` for easier processing. It then calculates the minimum number of coins needed for Kirill to reach a position no later than `k` by iterating through the lists and maintaining two variables: `pref` (prefix sum of costs) and `soma_b` (sum of additional costs).

3. The function calculates `pref` and `soma_b` based on the conditions specified in the code. It then computes the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for `i` ranging from `n - k` to `n - 1`, which represents the minimum coins needed for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

4. `func_2` handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1` for each test case.

The logic implemented in `func_1` seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of coins needed for Kirill to reach a position no later than `k` by considering the costs of bribing people and the additional costs for people who get bribed between the two positions. The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the execution summaries match the expected behavior, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
