### Reasoning:
The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which together aim to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic and correctness of both functions in the context of the problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function handles the logic for a single test case. Given the number of people `n` in the queue (excluding Kirill), the maximum allowable final position `m` for Kirill, and the lists `a` and `b`, it calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.
- **Logic**:
  - **Reversing Lists**: The function reverses `lista_A` and `lista_B`. This likely simplifies the logic for calculating the minimum cost since it processes the queue from the end to the beginning.
  - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: It iterates through the reversed lists up to `n - k` (which corresponds to the last `k` positions in the original list). It calculates `pref` (prefix sum of costs) and `soma_b` (sum of `b` values) based on the condition `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`.
  - **Final Calculation**: It then iterates from `n - k` to `n`, calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to reach any of the first `k` positions. The minimum cost is stored in `resultado`.
- **Output**: The function prints the minimum cost for the current test case.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1`.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the integer `numero_testes`, which represents the number of test cases.
  - It then iterates `numero_testes` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
- **Output**: No explicit output; it relies on `func_1` to print the results of each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Reversing Lists**: The reversal of `lista_A` and `lista_B` simplifies the problem by allowing the function to process the queue from the end to the beginning. This is a valid approach as it aligns with the problem's requirement of moving Kirill towards the front of the queue.
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The logic for calculating `pref` and `soma_b` is consistent with the problem's requirements. It ensures that the minimum cost is calculated based on the conditions provided.
- **Final Calculation**: The final iteration from `n - k` to `n` correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach any of the first `k` positions.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
