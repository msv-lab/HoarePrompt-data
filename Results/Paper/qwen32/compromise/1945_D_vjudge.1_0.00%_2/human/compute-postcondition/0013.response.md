Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are integers such that 1 <= k <= n. It also accepts two lists, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, each of length `n`, where each element in `lista_A` and `lista_B` is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output is not detailed here.**
