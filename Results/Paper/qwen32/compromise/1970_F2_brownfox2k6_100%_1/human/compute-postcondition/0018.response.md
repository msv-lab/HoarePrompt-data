Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is 0.
- `player` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'B', and 'C', and their corresponding values are lists of coordinates.
- `blud` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2.
- `out` is a list containing the strings 'A' and 'C'.

The print statement is:
```
print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
```

We need to determine the values of `t` and `p`. From the initial state, we know that `t` is 0. However, there is no mention of a variable `p` in the initial state. This means `p` is not defined in the given context, which will result in a `NameError` when the code is executed. But based on the task instructions, we should assume that `p` is a typo or a variable that should be `player`.

Given the context, let's assume `p` is meant to be `player`. Therefore, the print statement would be interpreted as:
```
print(t, player, 'ELIMINATED')
```

Now, we can determine the output:
- `t` is 0.
- `player` is the dictionary `{'A': [-1, -1], 'B': [3, 4], 'C': [-1, -1]}`.
- The string 'ELIMINATED' is a literal string.

So the output will be:
Output: **0 {'A': [-1, -1], 'B': [3, 4], 'C': [-1, -1]} ELIMINATED**
