To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the provided code and the problem requirements step by step.

### Problem Requirements Recap
1. **Field Representation**: The field is a grid with `N` rows and `M` columns, where each cell can contain players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
2. **Game Actions**: Players can move, catch the Quaffle, and throw the Quaffle. The Bludger can move and eliminate players. Players can be eliminated if they come into contact with the Bludger.
3. **Scoring**: A team scores a point if a player from their team throws the Quaffle into the opposing team's goal. If the Quaffle is thrown into the player's own goal, the opposing team scores.
4. **Output**: The program must output events (scoring and eliminations) and the final score at the end of the game.

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code snippet includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but it is incomplete and does not cover all the requirements of the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function is responsible for moving an object (`obj`) in one of the four directions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
    - This part of the code is correct and aligns with the problem requirements for moving entities on the field.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger (`blud`).
    - If a player is found on the same cell as the Bludger, the player is marked as eliminated by setting their position to `[-1, -1]` and an event is printed.
    - The function sorts the list of eliminated players alphabetically before printing the events.

### Missing Parts
- **Initialization**: The code does not initialize the field, players, goals, Quaffle, or Bludger positions.
- **Action Handling**: The code does not handle the actions of players (catching, throwing the Quaffle) or the Bludger's movements.
- **Scoring**: The code does not handle the scoring mechanism when the Quaffle is thrown into a goal.
- **Main Loop**: The code does not include the main loop that processes each step of the game and updates the field accordingly.
- **Final Score Output**: The code does not output the final score at the end of the game.

### Conclusion
The provided code snippet only includes two functions that handle movement and elimination, but it lacks the necessary initialization, action handling, scoring mechanism, and final score output. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not fully meet the problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**
