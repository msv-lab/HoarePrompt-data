N and M are odd integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99. The field is a 2D grid of size N x M where each cell can contain entities like players (R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9), goals (RG, BG), the Quaffle (.Q), or a Bludger (.B), or be empty (..). P is the number of players in each team, where 1 <= P <= 10. T is a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game, where 0 <= T <= 10000. Each step consists of a valid action performed by an entity in the grid.
