The code snippet updates the `current_key` variable to be a tuple of `num % x` and `num % y`. Given that `num` is `arr[1]`, the new `current_key` will be `(arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y)`. This change does not affect the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least one element; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`; `r_x` is the remainder of `-arr[1]` divided by `x`; `r_y` is `arr[1] % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y)`; `num` is `arr[1]`.**
