To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. These variables are directly tied to the structure of the `test_cases` list, where each element is a tuple containing these values.

Given that `test_cases` is a list of tuples, the loop will execute if and only if `test_cases` contains at least one tuple. This means we need to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one element. Let's break down the requirements:

1. **`n`**: This is the first element of each tuple. It represents the length of the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `n` should be a valid integer within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
2. **`x`**: This is the second element of each tuple. It should be an integer within the range (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9).
3. **`y`**: This is the third element of each tuple. It should be an integer within the range (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9).
4. **`arr`**: This is the fourth element of each tuple. It should be a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer is within the range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Given these requirements, we need to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one tuple that meets these criteria. The `results` list is empty and is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` (an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` (an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers, each integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `test_cases` must have at least one tuple; `results` is an empty list**.
