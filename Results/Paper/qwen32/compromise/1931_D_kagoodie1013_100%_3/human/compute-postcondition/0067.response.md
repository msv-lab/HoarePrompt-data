The code snippet updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count of the `current_key` by 1. The `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`. 

Given the initial state, `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, `count`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `residue_map` is a dictionary where the key `(num % x, num % y)` has its value incremented by 1; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the next element in `arr`. The value of `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1.**
