The code assigns the tuple `(num % x, num % y)` to the variable `current_key`. The values of `num`, `x`, and `y` are used to compute the new value of `current_key`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `residue_map`, `r_x`, and `r_y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least one element; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`; `r_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**.
