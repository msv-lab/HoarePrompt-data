The code snippet updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count associated with the `current_key` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is a dictionary where the key `(num % x, num % y)` has its value incremented by 1; `r_x` is `-n % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**

In simpler terms, the `residue_map` dictionary now has an updated count for the key `(num % x, num % y)`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
