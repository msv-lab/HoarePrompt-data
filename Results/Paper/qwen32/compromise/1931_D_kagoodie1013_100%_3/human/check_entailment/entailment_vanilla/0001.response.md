Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
Polycarp considers a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n) beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the number of beautiful pairs in the array \(a\). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by extracting the values of \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(a\).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a count to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues.
   - It iterates through each number in the array \(a\).
     - For the current number `num`, it calculates:
       - \(r_x = -num \% x\)
       - \(r_y = num \% y\)
     - It checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) exists in `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to the total count.
     - It then updates `residue_map` with the current number's residues \((num \% x, num \% y)\).

3. **Calculating Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The key part of the logic is the use of residues. For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful:
     - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\) or equivalently \(a_i \% x \equiv -a_j \% x \pmod{x}\).
     - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).
   - Therefore, for each number `num`, we are looking for previous numbers that have residues \((-num \% x, num \% y)\) in the `residue_map`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs using residues. Here's why:
- It correctly calculates the residues for each number and uses them to find previous numbers that would form a beautiful pair with the current number.
- The use of a dictionary to keep track of the residues allows the program to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs in linear time for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

**Correctness: True**
