The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and 2n inclusive. It constructs two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, where elements are grouped in blocks of size `k`, with each block containing the same integer starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent block. The last block may be smaller if `n` is not a multiple of `k`. The function prints the list `arr`, the number of blocks (cliques), and the list `cliquess`.
