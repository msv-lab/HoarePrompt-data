To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(not_mid):`, so we need to ensure that `not_mid` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Let's break down the given information:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`.
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.
- `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are set to values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are set to `clique`.

The loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0. Let's calculate `not_mid`:
\[ \text{not\_mid} = (\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) - \left(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left} + 1}{2}\right) \]

For `not_mid` to be greater than 0:
\[ (\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) - \left(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left} + 1}{2}\right) > 0 \]
\[ \frac{\text{right} - \text{left} + 1}{2} > 0 \]
\[ \text{right} - \text{left} + 1 > 0 \]

Since `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`, it follows that `right - left + 1 > 1`, which means `not_mid` will always be greater than 0 as long as `right > left + 1`. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `right > left + 1`. The other variables (`clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `arr`, and `cliquess`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right - 1 < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`; `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are set to values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`; `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are set to `clique`.**
