Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - This function is designed to handle each test case.
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays: `arr` for the values assigned to vertices and `cliquess` for the clique assignments.
   - It then iterates through each clique and calls `make_array` to populate the arrays.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
   - This function is supposed to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays for a specific range of vertices.
   - It calculates `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` to distribute values in a way that respects the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - It assigns values to `arr` and clique numbers to `cliquess`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Global Variables**:
   - The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are used in `make_array` but are defined in `func_1`. In Python, this would cause an `UnboundLocalError` because `make_array` does not recognize `arr` and `cliquess` as global variables.
   - To fix this, `arr` and `cliquess` should either be passed as parameters to `make_array` or declared as global variables.

2. **Logic for Assigning Values**:
   - The logic for assigning values in `make_array` seems to be intended to distribute the values in a way that respects the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`, but it is not clear whether this distribution guarantees the minimum number of cliques.
   - The distribution strategy should ensure that all pairs within a clique satisfy the condition and that the number of cliques is minimized.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when `k` is very small or very large.
   - It is important to ensure that the program works correctly for all valid inputs within the given constraints.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, particularly the use of global variables and the lack of clarity in the distribution strategy, the provided program is not guaranteed to be correct for all test cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
