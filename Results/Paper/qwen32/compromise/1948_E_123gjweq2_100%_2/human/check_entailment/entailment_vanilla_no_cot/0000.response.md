Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Global Variables**: The `make_array` function uses global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without declaring them as global within the function. This will result in a `UnboundLocalError` because Python will treat `arr` and `cliquess` as local variables within `make_array` unless explicitly declared as global.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Clique Count**: The calculation of the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)` is incorrect. This does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques required to partition the graph. The number of cliques should be determined based on the actual connections between vertices, not just by dividing `n` by `k`.

3. **Incorrect Assignment of Values to Vertices**: The way values are assigned to vertices in the `make_array` function does not ensure that all `a_i` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The assignment logic should ensure that each vertex gets a unique integer.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is not correctly handled. The program should print the values for each test case in the specified format.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def solve(n, k):
    # Assign values to vertices
    arr = list(range(1, n + 1))
    
    # Determine the number of cliques
    cliques = 0
    cliquess = [0] * n
    
    # Create cliques based on the condition
    current_clique = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if cliquess[i] == 0:
            queue = [i]
            while queue:
                u = queue.pop(0)
                if cliquess[u] == 0:
                    cliquess[u] = current_clique
                    for v in range(n):
                        if cliquess[v] == 0 and abs(u - v) + abs(arr[u] - arr[v]) <= k:
                            queue.append(v)
            current_clique += 1
    
    cliques = current_clique - 1
    
    # Print the results
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        k = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        solve(n, k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version ensures that the values assigned to vertices are distinct and correctly determines the minimum number of cliques by using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to group vertices into cliques based on the given condition.
