You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. These variables are not defined within the functions or passed as arguments, which can lead to undefined behavior and incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Array Initialization**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized with `0` values, but the problem requires distinct integers from 1 to n for `arr` and valid clique identifiers for `cliquess`.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Clique Size**: The number of cliques is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`, which may not be optimal for minimizing the number of cliques. The code does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques, which is a key requirement of the problem.

4. **Incorrect Array Population**: The `make_array` function does not correctly populate the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays. The logic for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

5. **Output Format**: The code prints the results directly within the function, which is not the expected behavior. The function should return the results, and the main part of the code should handle the input/output operations.

6. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `k` is large relative to `n`, the code should be able to partition the graph into a single clique, but the current logic does not handle this scenario correctly.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the input:
```
2
4 5
4 1
```

The expected output could be:
```
1 2 3 4
1
1 1 1 1
1 3 2 4
2
1 2 1 2
```

However, the provided code will not produce the correct output because of the issues mentioned above. For instance, the code may not correctly assign values to `arr` and `cliquess`, leading to incorrect cliques and partitions.

### Conclusion:
The code does not meet the problem requirements in several ways, including incorrect array initialization, logic for array population, and handling of edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
