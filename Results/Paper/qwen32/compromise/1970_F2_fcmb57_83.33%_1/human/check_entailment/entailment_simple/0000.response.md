### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

#### Parsing and Initialization:
- The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`).
- It initializes dictionaries to keep track of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
- It defines the movement vectors for the directions 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.
- It calculates the middle of the field where the Quaffle resets after a goal.
- It reads the field configuration, updating the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
- It initializes the score counters for both teams.

#### Processing Moves:
- The program reads the number of moves (`moves`).
- For each move, it processes the action based on the type (U, D, L, R, C, T).
- It handles movement actions by updating the player's position.
- It checks for collisions with the Bludger and eliminates players if necessary.
- It handles catching the Quaffle by updating the Quaffle's carrier.
- It handles throwing the Quaffle by resetting the carrier and checking if a goal has been scored.

#### Scoring and Elimination:
- The program checks if the Quaffle is thrown into a goal.
- It updates the score based on which team's goal was scored.
- It resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal.
- It prints the correct event messages for goals and eliminations in the required format.

#### Final Output:
- After processing all moves, the program prints the final score.

#### Issues in the Provided Code:
- The function `func_1` is defined to update the player's position correctly, but its description in the comments is incorrect. The comment states that it returns `(2*x, 2*y)`, but the actual implementation correctly returns `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
- The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` in the 'C' (catch) action is incorrect. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to assign the player to the Quaffle carrier.
- The logic for handling goals is incorrect. The program checks if the Quaffle position is in the goals list, but it should check if the player carrying the Quaffle is on a goal cell. The current implementation incorrectly resets the Quaffle to the player's position if the wrong goal is scored.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect handling of the 'C' action and the goal scoring logic, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
