The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, it interacts with an external system to determine two indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR (`p_i âŠ• p_j`) of the permutation elements. The function outputs these indices in the format "! i j" without exceeding 3n queries per test case.
