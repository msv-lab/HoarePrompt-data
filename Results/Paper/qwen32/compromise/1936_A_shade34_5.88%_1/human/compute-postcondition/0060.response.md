The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `pans`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. According to the loop statement `for i in range(1, len(pans))`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `pans` and `i` starts from 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`, and `pans` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and it should still be less than the length of `pans`.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:
- Since `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `n`.
- The length of `pans` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again because `i` needs to be less than the length of `pans`, and `i` is now `n`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `mak` is `n-1` if the input was '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `i` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, and `pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=', with the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists, and `pans` must have at least 3 elements.**
