The code snippet `mak = i` updates the value of the variable `mak` to the current value of `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-2`. Therefore, `mak` is now `n-2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n-2`, `mak` is `n-2`, `pans` is a list containing the single element `i` if `s` is `'<'`, `pans` is a list containing the element `n-1` if `s` is `'='`, and `pans` remains an empty list if `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `s` is the new input string.**
