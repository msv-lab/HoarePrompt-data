The code snippet `pans.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given that `i` is `n-1`, `pans` will now contain this value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `i` is n-1, `mak` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `pans` is a list containing the value `n-1`, `s` is the input string, `s` is not equal to `'<'`, and `s` equals `'='`**.
