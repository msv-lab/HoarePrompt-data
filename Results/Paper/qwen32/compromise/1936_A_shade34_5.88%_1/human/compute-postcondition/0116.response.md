To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables `i` and `n` as they are the only ones mentioned in the loop head.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is at least 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `mak` is `n-1` if the current value of `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` existed
- `mak2` is the same as `mak`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `pans` is `[n-1]` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, or `[n-1, n-1]` if `s` is not `'<'` and `pans` was not modified to `[n-1]` in the if part
- `s` is the input string

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In the current state, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and checked against `n`. However, since `i` is already `n-1`, incrementing it by 1 would make `i` equal to `n`, which means the loop condition `i in range(n)` would no longer be satisfied, and the loop would terminate.

Therefore, to have the loop execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to a value less than `n-1`. The most logical adjustment would be to set `i` to `0` (the start of the range) if we want to restart the loop, but since the task specifies adjusting the state to allow the next iteration, and we are at the end of the current range, there is no next iteration possible with the current `i` value.

However, if we consider the next valid state just before the loop would terminate, we can set `i` to `n-2` (the second last value in the range) to allow one more iteration.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `n-1` if the current value of `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` existed, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `i` is `n-2`, and `pans` is `[n-1]` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, or `[n-1, n-1]` if `s` is not `'<'` and `pans` was not modified to `[n-1]` in the if part, `s` is the input string**
