The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`, which is `n` in this context. Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the loop's continuation condition, we only need to ensure that the loop can execute again based on the value of `n`.

Given that the loop has just finished an iteration, `n` must have been decremented by 1 (since each iteration of the loop decrements the range by 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 1.

Since `n` is the integer value of the input and it controls how many more times the loop will run, we need to adjust `n` to reflect the remaining iterations. At the start of the next iteration, `n` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input minus 1, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, and `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` that resulted in the input `'>'`, or 0 if no such element exists.**
