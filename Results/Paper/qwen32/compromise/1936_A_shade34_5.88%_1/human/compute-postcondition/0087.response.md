The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input and must be greater than 2, `mak` is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is 0, `i` is 2, and `pans` is unchanged.**
