Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the input string, and `pans` is `[n-1, n]` if `s` was '=', otherwise `pans` is `[n-1]` if `s` was '<', or remains an empty list if `s` was neither '=' nor '<'.**
