The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns a new list containing the value of `i` to the variable `pans`. 

Given the initial state where `i` is `n-2`, after executing the code, `pans` will be updated to `[n-2]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `n-2`, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `i` is `n-2`, `pans` is `[n-2]`, `s` is the new input string.**
