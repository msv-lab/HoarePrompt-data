Given the initial state, we can analyze the variables and their values:

- `t` is at least 1, but its exact value is not important for this print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but its exact value is also not important for this print statement.
- `mak2` is 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, where `pans` is a list. Since the length of `pans` is not specified, we can only describe `i` in terms of the length of `pans`.
- `mak` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Breaking down the print statement:
- The first argument is a string `'?'`.
- The second and third arguments are both `mak`, which is 0.
- The fourth and fifth arguments are both `i`, which is `len(pans) - 1`.

Thus, the output will be the string `'?'` followed by the value of `mak` twice, and the value of `i` twice.

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is len(pans) - 1)**
