Output State: **t is at least 1, n is greater than or equal to the current value of i, mak is the largest i for which the input was '<', i is n-1, mak2 is equal to mak.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains at least 1, `n` is still greater than or equal to the current value of `i`, `mak` retains its value as the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` remains `n-1`, and `mak2` is now equal to `mak`.
