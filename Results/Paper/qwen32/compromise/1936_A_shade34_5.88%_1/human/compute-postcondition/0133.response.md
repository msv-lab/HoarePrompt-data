The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `len(pans)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `pans`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should be less than `len(pans)`.

Since `i` is currently `n`, and `n` is the integer value of the input, `i` should be `n + 1` at the start of the next iteration. However, for the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`. Therefore, `len(pans)` must be at least `n + 2` to ensure that `i` can be `n + 1` and the loop can still execute.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, and `pans` is a list containing at least `n + 2` elements. If the input is '>', then `mak` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
