Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func()` does not take any input parameters directly. Instead, it interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) followed by a hidden permutation `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` of the integers from 0 to n-1. The function can make queries to the system by printing lines in the format "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and it will receive a response of "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison of the bitwise OR operations on the elements of the permutation. The function must find two indices i and j such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized and print the result in the format "! i j" without exceeding 3n queries per test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, mak)
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` that caused the input to be '>', or 0 if no such element was found, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, and `pans` is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, and `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` that resulted in the input `'>'`, or 0 if no such element exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1, `mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<`, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, and `mak` is the last index `i` where the input was `'>'` (if any), otherwise it remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
