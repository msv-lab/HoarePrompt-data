The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `mak`. The initial state specifies that `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0. After executing the code, `mak` will definitely be `i` regardless of the initial value of `mak`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `mak` is `i`, and `i` is `i + 2`.**
