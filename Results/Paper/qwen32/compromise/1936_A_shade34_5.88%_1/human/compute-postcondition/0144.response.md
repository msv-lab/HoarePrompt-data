Let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the input.
- `mak2` is initialized to 0.
- `i` is set to `len(pans) - 1`.
- `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` that resulted in the input `'>'`, or 0 if no such element exists.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('!', mak2, mak)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output the string `'!'` followed by the values of `mak2` and `mak`.

Given the initial state:
- `mak2` is explicitly defined as 0.
- `mak` is defined as the index of the last element in `pans` that resulted in the input `'>'`, or 0 if no such element exists. Since no additional information about `pans` is provided, `mak` could be 0 if no element in `pans` resulted in `'>'`, or it could be any other valid index if such an element exists.

Since we don't have more specific information about `pans` or the presence of `'>'` in `pans`, we can only state that `mak` is either 0 or another index based on the condition specified.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output `'!'`, followed by the value of `mak2` which is 0, and the value of `mak` which could be 0 or another index based on the condition.

Output: **! 0 mak (where mak is the index of the last element in `pans` that resulted in the input `'>'`, or 0 if no such element exists)**
