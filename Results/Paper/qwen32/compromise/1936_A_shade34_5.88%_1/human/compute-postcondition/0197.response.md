Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`. `i` is `n-1`. If `s` is `'<'`, `mak` is `n-1` and `pans` is `[i]`. If `s` is `'='`, `mak` is `n-2` if the previous `s` was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the largest i for which the input was `<` before the if statement, and `pans` is `[i, n-1, i]`. If `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `mak` is `n-2` if the previous `s` was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the largest i for which the input was `<` before the if statement, and `pans` contains the original elements with one additional element `i`.**
