Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `mak` is `i + 1` if the input was '>', otherwise `mak` remains its previous value, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, `pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=', with the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists, and `pans` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `i + 1`.**
