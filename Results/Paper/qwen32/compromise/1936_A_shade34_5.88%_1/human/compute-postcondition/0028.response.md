The code snippet assigns the list `[i]` to the variable `pans`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `n-1`. Therefore, `pans` will be a list containing the single element `n-1`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is `[n-1]`, `s` is the input string, and `s` is equal to '<'.**
