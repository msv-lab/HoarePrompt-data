Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is at least 1.
2. `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
3. `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
4. `i` is `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `mak`:**
   - The value of `mak` depends on the input string.
   - If the input string is `'<'`, then `mak` is set to the value of `i`.
   - Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
   
2. **Variable `i`:**
   - The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement is executed.
   - Therefore, the value of `i` in the print statement will be the incremented value.

### Output Determination:
- The print statement will output `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.
- Since `mak` is either `i` (if the input string is `'<'`) or `0` (otherwise), and `i` is incremented by 1, the output will reflect these conditions.

### Final Output Description:
- If the input string is `'<'`, `mak` will be the previous value of `i`, and `i` will be the incremented value.
- If the input string is not `'<'`, `mak` will be `0`, and `i` will be the incremented value.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where [mak] is i if the input string is '<', otherwise 0, and [i] is the incremented value of i)**

To make it more precise, let's consider both scenarios:

1. **If the input string is `'<'`:**
   - `mak` is the previous value of `i`.
   - `i` is the incremented value of `i`.
   - Output: **? [previous_i] [previous_i] [incremented_i] [incremented_i]**

2. **If the input string is not `'<'`:**
   - `mak` is `0`.
   - `i` is the incremented value of `i`.
   - Output: **? 0 0 [incremented_i] [incremented_i]**

Since the exact value of `i` before the increment and the input string are not specified, we use the general form:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where [mak] is i if the input string is '<', otherwise 0, and [i] is the incremented value of i)**
