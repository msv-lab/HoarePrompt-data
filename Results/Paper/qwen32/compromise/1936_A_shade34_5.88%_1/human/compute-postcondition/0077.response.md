Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is at least 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is the integer value of the input and must be greater than 1, but it is also not used in the print statement.
- `mak` is initialized to 0.
- `mak2` is initialized to 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `pans` is mentioned as unchanged, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

From the initial state, we know the values of `mak` and `i`:
- `mak` is 0.
- `i` is 0.

The print statement will output a question mark followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i` respectively.

Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
