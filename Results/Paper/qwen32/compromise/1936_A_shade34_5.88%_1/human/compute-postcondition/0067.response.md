The provided Python code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not change the values of any variables; it simply flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the console immediately.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, `i`) are affected by the `sys.stdout.flush()` call. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only change being the increment of `i` by 1 as per the precondition.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `mak` is `n` if the input was '>', otherwise `mak` remains `n-1` if the input was '>', or `mak` remains 0 if the input was not '>', `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, `pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=', with the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists, and `pans` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `i + 1`**.
