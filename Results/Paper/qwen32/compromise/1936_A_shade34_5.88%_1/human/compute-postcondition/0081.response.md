Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input and must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `i` is 0, and `pans` is unchanged. If the input is the string `<`, the same conditions hold; otherwise, the same conditions also hold as there is no else part to modify the variables.**
