Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, and `st` is a set used to store midpoints during the binary search process.**

In simple terms, the values of `n` and `k` remain as the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` remains the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` retains its previous value (the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1). The variables `low` and `high` have been updated such that `low` is now 0 and `high` is now equal to `n`. The set `st` is still used to store midpoints during the binary search process.
