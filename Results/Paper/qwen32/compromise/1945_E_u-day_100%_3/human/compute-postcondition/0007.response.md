To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop, we need to focus on the condition `low + 1 < high`. The variables involved in this condition are `low` and `high`.

Given:
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n`.

For the loop to execute, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true. Substituting the known values, this becomes `0 + 1 < n` or simply `1 < n`.

Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute. No other variables (`k`, `arr`, `pos`, `st`) need to be adjusted because they do not appear in the loop condition.

Thus, the state needs to be modified to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, and `st` is an empty set**.
