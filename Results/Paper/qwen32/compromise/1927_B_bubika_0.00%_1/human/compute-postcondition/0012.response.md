The code snippet `r += a[x]` adds the value of `a[x]` to the variable `r`. Given the initial state, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, so `a[x]` refers to the element in `a` at the position where `i` is found in `b`.

The values of `s`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged by this operation, but `r` is updated to its previous value plus `a[x]`.

Output State: **`s` is unchanged, `i` is the next element in `s` after the previous value of `i`, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `r` is updated to `r + a[x]`.**
