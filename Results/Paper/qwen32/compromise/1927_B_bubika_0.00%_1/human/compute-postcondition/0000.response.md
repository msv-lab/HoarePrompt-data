In the given task, the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and for each test case, `n` is an integer with its own range, and `a` is a list of integers with specific constraints. However, the provided Python code snippet does not utilize `t`, `n`, or `a` as defined in the initial state. Instead, it assigns a string to the variable `a`.

Given this, the variable `a` is reassigned to the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and the original `a` which was a list of integers) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and `a` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.**
