The code snippet `b[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `b` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `r` is `2 * a[x]`
- `b` has incremented values at the indices corresponding to the elements in `s` with the value at index `x` increased by 1
- `t` is `X + len(s)`
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element
- `x` is `b.index(s[x + 1])`
- `i` is `s[x]`

After executing `b[x] += 1`, the value at index `x` in `b` is increased by 1. This means the value of `b[x]` is now `b[x] + 1`.

No other variables are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`r` is `2 * a[x]`, `b` has incremented values at the indices corresponding to the elements in `s` with the value at index `x` increased by 2, `t` is `X + len(s)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `x` is `b.index(s[x + 1])`, `i` is `s[x]`**
