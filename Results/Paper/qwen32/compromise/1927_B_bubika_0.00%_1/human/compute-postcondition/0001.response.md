Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and `a` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`; `b` is a list of 26 zeros.**

Natural language: The variable `b` has been initialized to a list containing 26 zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
