`r` is initially `a[x]` and then it is incremented by `a[x]`, so `r` becomes `2 * a[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is `2 * a[x]`, `b` has incremented values at the indices corresponding to the elements in `s` with the value at index `x` increased by 1, `t` is `X + len(s)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `x` is `b.index(s[x + 1])`, `i` is `s[x]`**.
