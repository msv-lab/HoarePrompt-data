Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0

The code `num_tests -= 1` decrements the value of `num_tests` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `num_tests` must be greater than 0, after this operation, `num_tests` will still be a positive integer, but its value will be reduced by 1 compared to its initial state. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is a positive integer and is reduced by 1 from its initial value.**
