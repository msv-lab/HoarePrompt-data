The code modifies the value of `start_year` by performing a calculation involving the current `start_year` and the element at index `x` in the `nums` list. Given that `x` is 1, the new value of `start_year` will be `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.

Since `start_year` was initially `nums[x]` and `x` is 1, `start_year` was `nums[1]`. Let's denote `nums[1]` as `y` for simplicity. The new value of `start_year` will be `(y // y + 1) * y`, which simplifies to `(1 + 1) * y` or `2 * y`. Therefore, `start_year` becomes `2 * nums[1]`.

The values of `t`, `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `start_year`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is a positive integer and is now reduced by 1 from its initial value; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 integer; `start_year` is `2 * nums[1]`; `x` is 1**.
