To determine the output of the `print(start_year)` statement, we need to understand the value of `start_year` based on the given initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `num_tests` is a positive integer and is now reduced by 1 from its initial value.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers.
- `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `nums`.

The key variable here is `start_year`, which is defined as the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `nums`. The LCM of a set of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the integers.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`. However, we can describe `start_year` in terms of the elements in `nums`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `nums`)**
