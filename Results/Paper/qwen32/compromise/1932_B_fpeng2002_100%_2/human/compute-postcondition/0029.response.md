The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is now `num_tests - 1`, meaning it has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0 after this decrement.

Therefore, before the decrement, `num_tests` must have been at least 1. So, we need to ensure that `num_tests` is adjusted to be at least 1 before the decrement operation in the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all the integers in the `nums` list**
