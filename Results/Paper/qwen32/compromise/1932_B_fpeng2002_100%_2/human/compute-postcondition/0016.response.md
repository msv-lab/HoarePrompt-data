The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is now reduced by 1 from its initial value. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Since `num_tests` has been reduced by 1, we need to adjust it to be at least 1 to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `nums`.**
