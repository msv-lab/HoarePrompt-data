Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0 and is now `num_tests - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; `start_year` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been explicitly set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values or states as described.
