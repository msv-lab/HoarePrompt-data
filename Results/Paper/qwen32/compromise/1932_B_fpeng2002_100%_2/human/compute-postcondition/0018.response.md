The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The previous value of `n` is overwritten by this new input value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0 and is now `num_tests - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `nums`.**
