The code modifies the value of `start_year` based on the value of `nums[x]`. Initially, `start_year` is 0. The new value of `start_year` is calculated as `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which simplifies to `(0 // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, and further simplifies to `1 * nums[x]`, or simply `nums[x]`.

Therefore, the value of `start_year` is updated to `nums[x]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is at least 0; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 integer; `start_year` is `nums[x]`**.
