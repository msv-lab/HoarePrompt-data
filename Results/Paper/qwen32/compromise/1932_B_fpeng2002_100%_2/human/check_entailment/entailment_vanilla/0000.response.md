Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, so the occurrence of each subsequent sign must be strictly after the previous one.

### Program Explanation:
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case:
1. Reads the number of signs `n`.
2. Reads the periodicities of the signs into a list `nums`.
3. Initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year from which we start waiting for the first sign.
4. Iterates over each sign's periodicity in `nums`:
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than the current `start_year`.
   - This is done using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which effectively computes the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.
5. After processing all signs, it prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year when the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Example Input:
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

#### Example Output:
```
36
5
5
2012
```

- For the first test case:
  - The first sign occurs in year 3.
  - The second sign occurs in year 4.
  - The third sign occurs in year 8.
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 10.
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 18.
  - The sixth sign occurs in year 36.
  - This matches the expected output.

- For the second, third, and fourth test cases, the program correctly computes the year for the last sign based on the given periodicities and the sequential occurrence rule.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the year in which the last sign occurs and the apocalypse happens for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
