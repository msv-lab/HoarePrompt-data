The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if there are at least `n` sequences of `k` distinct characters in the string `s`. If so, it outputs "YES". Otherwise, it outputs "NO" followed by a constructed string consisting of the `k`-th letter repeated `cnt` times, a specific character based on the current state, and 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.
