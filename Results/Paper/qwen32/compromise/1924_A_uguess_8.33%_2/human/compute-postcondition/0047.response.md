The code snippet `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the string `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will now consist of its previous value concatenated with `tmp`.

Given that `ans` was initially a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, and `tmp` is either the `k`-th letter in the alphabet or the last valid character assigned, the new value of `ans` will be the old `ans` with `tmp` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters, `i` is `k-1`. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet. Otherwise, `tmp` remains the last valid character assigned. `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp`.**
