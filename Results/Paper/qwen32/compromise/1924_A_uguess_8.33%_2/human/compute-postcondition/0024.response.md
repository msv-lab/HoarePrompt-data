The given code snippet modifies the variable `cur` by performing a bitwise left shift operation on `1` by the value of `cur_ss` and then adding the result to `cur`. This operation effectively sets the bit at the position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` to `1`.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `cur`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current character, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cnt` and `cur` remain as per the conditions described, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**.

In natural language, the output state means that the value of `cur` has been updated by setting the bit at the position `cur_ss` to `1` in its binary representation, while all other variables retain their initial values.
