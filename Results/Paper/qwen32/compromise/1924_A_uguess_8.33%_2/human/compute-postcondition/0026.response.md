The code snippet provided increments the variable `cnt` by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `cur` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation `cnt += 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current character, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, and `cur` remains as per the conditions described.**
