The code snippet assigns a new character to the variable `tmp` based on the value of `i`. Specifically, `tmp` is set to the character that corresponds to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is `i + 1`, `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + i)`**. 

In simpler terms, `tmp` is now the character corresponding to the `i`-th letter in the alphabet, starting from 'a' when `i` is 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `cnt` remain unchanged, and `i` has been incremented by 1.
