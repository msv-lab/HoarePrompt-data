The given Python code snippet initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`) are mentioned in the initial state but are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is 0.**
