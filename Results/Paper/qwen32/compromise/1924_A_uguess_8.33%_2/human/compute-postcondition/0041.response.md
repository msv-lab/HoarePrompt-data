The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` calculates the ASCII value of 'a', adds the value of `i` to it, and converts it back to a character, which is then assigned to `tmp`. Given that `i` is 1, `tmp` will be assigned the character 'b'. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters, `i` is 1, `tmp` is 'b', `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times.**
