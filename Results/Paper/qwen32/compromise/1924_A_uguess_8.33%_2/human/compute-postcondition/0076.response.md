The code snippet provided increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `cur`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `cnt` is 0 or 1
- `ss` is the next character in the string `s`
- `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet
- If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

After executing `cnt += 1`, the value of `cnt` will be 1 if it was 0, or 2 if it was 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 1 or 2, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet, and `cur` is updated based on the condition `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`.**
