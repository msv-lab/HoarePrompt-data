Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. Additionally, the bitwise AND of `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` is 0, indicating that the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is not set.**
