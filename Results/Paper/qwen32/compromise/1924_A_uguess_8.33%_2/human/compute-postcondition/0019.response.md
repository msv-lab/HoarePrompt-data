Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`. If `cur` was originally equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. `ss` is the second character of `s`. `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `cnt` is increased by 1, while all other variables retain their original values and conditions.
