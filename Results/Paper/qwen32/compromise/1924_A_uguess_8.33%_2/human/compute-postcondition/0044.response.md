The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` sets the value of `tmp` to the character that is `i` positions after 'a' in the alphabet.

Given `i` is 2, we can calculate the new value of `tmp` as follows:
- `ord('a')` is 97.
- `ord('a') + i` is 97 + 2, which is 99.
- `chr(99)` is 'c'.

Thus, `tmp` becomes 'c'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters, `i` is 2, `tmp` is 'c', `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times.**
