The code snippet calculates the ASCII value of the character `ss` and subtracts the ASCII value of 'a' from it, assigning the result to `cur_ss`. This operation effectively converts the character `ss` to its position in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `cur_ss`, which is now the calculated position of `ss` in the alphabet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).**
