The code snippet provided assigns a new value to the variable `tmp` based on the value of `i`. The value of `tmp` becomes the `i`-th letter in the alphabet, where `i` is zero-indexed.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `tmp`, which now holds the `i`-th letter in the alphabet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `i`-th letter in the alphabet, `ans` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, and the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0.**
