The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, or `cnt`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all these variables except for the newly introduced `cur`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0.**
