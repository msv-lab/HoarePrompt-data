The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` modifies the value of `cur` by performing a bitwise OR operation with `1` left-shifted by `cur_ss` positions. This operation sets the `cur_ss`-th bit of `cur` to 1.

Given the initial state, the only variable affected by this operation is `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet, the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet, `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.**
