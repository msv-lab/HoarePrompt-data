The code snippet provided sets `cnt` to 0. This change affects the variable `cnt` directly, while all other variables remain unchanged. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is the newly input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters, `i` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains the last valid character assigned, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.**
