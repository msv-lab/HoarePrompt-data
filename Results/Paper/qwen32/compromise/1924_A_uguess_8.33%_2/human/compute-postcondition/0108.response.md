Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are the input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet if `cnt` is 0, otherwise the last valid character assigned (unchanged), `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times (unchanged), `i` is `i + 1` (unchanged), `cur_ss` is the integer value representing the 0-based index of `ss` in the alphabet, and `cur` does not have the bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1.**
