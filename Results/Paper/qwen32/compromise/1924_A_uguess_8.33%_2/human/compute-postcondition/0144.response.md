The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` converts the integer `i` to a character by adding it to the ASCII value of 'a' and then converting the result back to a character. This means if `i` is 0, `tmp` becomes 'a', if `i` is 1, `tmp` becomes 'b', and so on.

Given the initial state where `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, the value of `tmp` will be the character corresponding to the position `i` in the alphabet, starting from 'a'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are the input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively, `cur` is 0, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `tmp` is the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`, `ans` remains as defined.**
