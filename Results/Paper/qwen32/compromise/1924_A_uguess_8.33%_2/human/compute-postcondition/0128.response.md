Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.). If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0 and `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
