The code snippet provided increments the variable `cnt` by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cur`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.). If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` was not set, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
