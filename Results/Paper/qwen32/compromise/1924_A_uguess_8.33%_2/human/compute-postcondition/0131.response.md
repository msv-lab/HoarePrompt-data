Given the initial state, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
- `n`, `k`, `m` are input integers.
- `s` is an input string.
- `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively and is greater than or equal to `n`.
- `cur` is 0.
- `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet.
- `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of any of the variables mentioned above. It directly prints the string 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will output the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
