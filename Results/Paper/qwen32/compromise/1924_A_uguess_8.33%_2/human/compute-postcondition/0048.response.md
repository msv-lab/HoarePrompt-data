The code appends 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times to the string `ans`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp`. After the execution of the code, `ans` will have 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters, `i` is `k-1`. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet. Otherwise, `tmp` remains the last valid character assigned. `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.**
