Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are the input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur_ss` is the integer value representing the 0-based index of `ss` in the alphabet. If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `cur` remains unchanged, `tmp` remains the `k`-th letter in the alphabet if `cnt` was 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
