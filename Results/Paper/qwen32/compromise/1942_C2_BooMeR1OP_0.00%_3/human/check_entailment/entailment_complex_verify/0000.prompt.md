You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #This is printed: ans (where ans is calculated as x - 2 plus the sum of some or all gaps depending on y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints a value `ans` for each test case based on the number of vertices `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, an integer `y`, and a list of `x` distinct chosen vertices. The value `ans` is determined by considering the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and adjusting it based on the value of `y`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements in all cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum number of triangular pieces is flawed. Let's analyze why:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   ```python
   ans = x - 2
   ```
   This initialization assumes that the initial `x` vertices can form `x-2` triangles, which is not always true. The initial vertices might not form any triangles if they are not chosen in a way that allows for non-intersecting triangles.

2. **Handling of Gaps**:
   The program calculates gaps between the vertices and tries to fill these gaps with additional vertices to form triangles. However, the logic for filling gaps is not optimal and does not guarantee the maximum number of triangles:
   ```python
   pairs = gap // 2
   if y >= pairs:
       ans += gap
       y -= pairs
   else:
       ans += 2 * y
       break
   ```
   The program assumes that filling a gap with `pairs` vertices will always add `gap` triangles, which is not correct. The number of triangles added depends on the specific placement of the vertices and the structure of the polygon.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   The program does not handle edge cases where the initial vertices are not optimally placed to form triangles. For example, if the initial vertices are chosen in such a way that they form a chain without any triangles, the program might not be able to form any triangles even if additional vertices are added.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
6 3 2
1 3 5
```
- The vertices chosen are 1, 3, and 5.
- The gaps between these vertices are 2 (between 1 and 3), 2 (between 3 and 5), and 2 (between 5 and 1).
- The program would attempt to fill these gaps with the additional 2 vertices, but it might not correctly calculate the number of triangles that can be formed.

### Expected Output:
For the above test case, the expected output is `3` because you can form triangles by adding vertices to create a triangulation like this:
- Add vertices 2 and 4.
- Form triangles (1, 2, 3), (3, 4, 5), and (5, 1, 6).

### Actual Output:
The program might output a different number of triangles, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
