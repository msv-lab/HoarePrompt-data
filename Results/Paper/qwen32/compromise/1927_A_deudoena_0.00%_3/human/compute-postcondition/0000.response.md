Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present in `s`. `inpstr` is assigned the value of `input()`.**

In natural language: The output state is the same as the initial state except for the new variable `inpstr`, which is assigned the value from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
