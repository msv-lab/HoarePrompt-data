Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between \(n\) points in an \(n \times n\) grid. However, the program does not achieve this goal for all values of \(n\).

Let's break down the program and see why it doesn't work correctly for all test cases:

1. For \(n = 2\):
   - The program outputs points (1, 1) and (1, 2). This is correct as it maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) to be 2 (distances 0 and 1).

2. For \(n = 3\):
   - The program outputs points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). This does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). The correct solution should be (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1) as shown in the example, which gives distances 0, 1, 2, and 3.

3. For \(n = 4\):
   - The program outputs points (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4). This does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). The correct solution should be different, as shown in the example.

4. For \(n = 5\):
   - The program outputs points (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5). This does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

5. For \(n = 6\):
   - The program outputs points (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6). This does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

The program only works correctly for \(n = 2\) and fails for larger values of \(n\). Therefore, the program is not correct for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
