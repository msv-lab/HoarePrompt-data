Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all test cases. Let's analyze why:

1. **Initial Points**: The program always starts with points (1, 1) and (1, 2). This is fine for the first two points, but the subsequent points are not strategically placed to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

2. **Subsequent Points**: After the first two points, the program places points at (i, i) for i from 3 to n. This placement does not maximize the variety of Manhattan distances between points. For example, all points (i, i) form a diagonal and have the same Manhattan distance to the point (1, 1), which is \(2(i-1)\). Similarly, the Manhattan distances between points (i, i) and (1, 2) are \(2(i-1) - 1\), which means there are fewer distinct distances than possible.

3. **Maximizing Distances**: To maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances, points should be placed in a way that creates a wide variety of distances. One effective strategy is to place points at the corners and along the edges of the grid, or in a pattern that ensures a wide spread of distances.

Let's consider the example for n = 3. The program outputs:
- (1, 1)
- (1, 2)
- (3, 3)

The Manhattan distances are:
- Between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- Between (1, 1) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
- Between (1, 2) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)

So, the set of Manhattan distances is \(\{1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 3. However, an optimal arrangement for n = 3 could be:
- (2, 1)
- (2, 3)
- (3, 1)

The Manhattan distances are:
- Between (2, 1) and (2, 3): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
- Between (2, 1) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
- Between (2, 3) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)

So, the set of Manhattan distances is \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), which also has a size of 3. However, for larger n, the strategy used in the program will not yield the optimal result.

Correctness: **False**
