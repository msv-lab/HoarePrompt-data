The given `print` statement is `print(1, 1)`. This statement directly prints the values 1 and 1, separated by a space. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `i`), but they are not used in the provided print statement. Therefore, the values of these variables do not affect the output of the print statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The `print` statement is executed.
2. It prints the first argument, which is the integer `1`.
3. It prints a space (automatically added by the `print` function when multiple arguments are provided).
4. It prints the second argument, which is also the integer `1`.

Output: **1 1**
