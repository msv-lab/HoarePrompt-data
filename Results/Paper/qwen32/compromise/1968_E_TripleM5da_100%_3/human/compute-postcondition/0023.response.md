The value of `n` is reassigned to the integer value of the user input. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is unchanged, `n` is the integer value of the input, and `i` is `n` (from the initial state).

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is the integer value of the input, and `i` is `n`**
