The given initial state does not provide any information about the variable `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the precondition, we cannot determine its value based on the provided information. Therefore, the print statement `print(i, i)` will result in a `NameError` because `i` is not defined.

However, if we assume that the variable `i` is defined somewhere in the code that is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `i`.

Given the lack of information, the most precise description is that the code will raise an error if `i` is not defined. But based on the task requirements, we will describe the output as it would be if `i` were defined, acknowledging the uncertainty.

Output: **i, i (where i is the value of the variable i)**

Since the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, the actual output would be an error. But for the purpose of this task, we describe the output as above.
