You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2

    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.

    #State: a series of integers, each representing the result of the corresponding test case based on the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer result based on the specific conditions involving `n` and `k`. The result is determined by whether `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, equal to `4 * n - 3`, or equal to `4 * n - 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Main Diagonals and Anti-Diagonals**:
   - There are two main diagonals (one top-left to bottom-right, and one top-right to bottom-left).
   - There are \( n-2 \) diagonals above the main diagonal and \( n-2 \) diagonals below the main diagonal.
   - Similarly, there are \( n-2 \) anti-diagonals above the main anti-diagonal and \( n-2 \) anti-diagonals below the main anti-diagonal.
   - Therefore, the total number of diagonals is \( 2 + 2(n-2) + 2(n-2) = 4n - 2 \).

2. **Minimum Cells to Color**:
   - If \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), we can color cells in such a way that we cover the diagonals optimally. Specifically, coloring cells in a checkerboard pattern (alternating rows and columns) ensures that each pair of diagonals can be covered by just one cell.
   - If \( k = 4n - 3 \), we need to cover all but one diagonal. The optimal strategy is to cover all diagonals except the longest one, which requires \( 2n - 1 \) cells.
   - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), we need to cover all diagonals. The optimal strategy is to cover all diagonals, which requires \( 2n \) cells.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
- It then checks the value of \( k \) and prints the minimum number of cells to color based on the observations above.

### Code Check:
1. **Case \( k \leq 4n - 4 \)**:
   - The program correctly prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \), which is the minimum number of cells needed to cover at least \( k \) diagonals optimally.
2. **Case \( k = 4n - 3 \)**:
   - The program correctly prints \( 2n - 1 \), which is the minimum number of cells needed to cover all but one diagonal.
3. **Case \( k = 4n - 2 \)**:
   - The program correctly prints \( 2n \), which is the minimum number of cells needed to cover all diagonals.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells needed to color for each test case.
