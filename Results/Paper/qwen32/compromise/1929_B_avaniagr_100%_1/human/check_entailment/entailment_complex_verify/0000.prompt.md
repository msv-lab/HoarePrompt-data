You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
        
    #State: a series of integers, each representing the result of the corresponding test case based on the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer result based on the specific conditions involving `n` and `k`. The result is determined by whether `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, equal to `4 * n - 3`, or equal to `4 * n - 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color when \( k \) is greater than \( 4n - 4 \) is incorrect.

Let's analyze the logic in the code:
- For \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), the program prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
- For \( k = 4n - 3 \), the program prints \( 2n - 1 \).
- For \( k = 4n - 2 \), the program prints \( 2n \).

However, the problem description states that a grid of size \( n \times n \) has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals. Therefore, \( k \) can never be greater than \( 4n - 2 \). The cases for \( k = 4n - 3 \) and \( k = 4n - 2 \) are correct, but the logic for \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) needs to be verified.

The logic for \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) seems incorrect because it doesn't consider the optimal way to color the cells to cover the diagonals. Specifically, the formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) does not guarantee that the minimum number of cells will cover the required diagonals optimally.

Let's consider a counterexample:
- For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 6 \), the grid has \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \) diagonals. We need to color cells such that at least 6 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program would output \( \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 \), but it's possible to cover 6 diagonals with only 2 cells (one at (1,1) and one at (3,3)).

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly, and the Correctness is **False**.
