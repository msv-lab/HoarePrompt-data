Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color when \( k \) is greater than \( 4n - 4 \) is incorrect.

Let's analyze the logic in the code:
- For \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), the program prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
- For \( k = 4n - 3 \), the program prints \( 2n - 1 \).
- For \( k = 4n - 2 \), the program prints \( 2n \).

However, the problem description states that a grid of size \( n \times n \) has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals. Therefore, \( k \) can never be greater than \( 4n - 2 \). The cases for \( k = 4n - 3 \) and \( k = 4n - 2 \) are correct, but the logic for \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) needs to be verified.

The logic for \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) seems incorrect because it doesn't consider the optimal way to color the cells to cover the diagonals. Specifically, the formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) does not guarantee that the minimum number of cells will cover the required diagonals optimally.

Let's consider a counterexample:
- For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 6 \), the grid has \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \) diagonals. We need to color cells such that at least 6 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program would output \( \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 \), but it's possible to cover 6 diagonals with only 2 cells (one at (1,1) and one at (3,3)).

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly, and the Correctness is **False**.
