Postcondition: **`left` is not equal to 0, `s` is "001011", `leftZero` is -2, `leftOne` is -1, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 3, `rightOne` is 3, `trightZero` is 2, `trightOne` is 0, `leftMove` is 0. If `right` equals `n`, then `right` equals `n` and if `left` is equal to 0, `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `right` is not equal to `n` and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.**
