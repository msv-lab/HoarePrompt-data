The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. However, the loop actually depends on the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times.

Given this, the only state we need to adjust is `t` to ensure that the loop can execute. Since `t` is the number of test cases and the loop will iterate `t` times, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
