The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 otherwise plus 1, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `trightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0' and 0 otherwise, `i` is 1, and `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.
