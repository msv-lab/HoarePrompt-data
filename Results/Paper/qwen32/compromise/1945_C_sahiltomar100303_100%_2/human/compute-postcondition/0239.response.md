Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `right` is 3; `n` is greater than 4; `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise 0; `trightOne` is 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise -1; `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise 0; `trightZero` is 0 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise 1.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, the values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `right` remain unchanged from their initial values as described in the precondition. The value of `tleftZero` is 1 if the character at index `right` of the string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0. The value of `trightOne` is 1 if the character at index `right` of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is -1. The value of `tleftOne` is 1 if the character at index `right` of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is 0. The value of `trightZero` is 0 if the character at index `right` of the string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 1.
