Postcondition: **left is not 0, right is either n or not equal to n, tleftZero is at least (n + 1) // 2, and trightOne is at least 0. If right is n, then left remains unchanged, and tleftZero is at least (n + 1) // 2, potentially less than (n + 1) // 2 if left was 0. If right is not n, then the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is greater than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right.**
