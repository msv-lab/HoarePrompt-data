Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is 1, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is 0, and the current character `s[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1 due to the line `rightZero += 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
