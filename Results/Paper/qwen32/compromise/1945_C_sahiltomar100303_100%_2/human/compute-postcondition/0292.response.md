The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index and `mid` is the upper bound for the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `mid` must remain the same.
