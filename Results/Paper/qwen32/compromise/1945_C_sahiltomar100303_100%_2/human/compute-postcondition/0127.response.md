Postcondition: **`left` is either not 0 or 0. If `left` is not 0, `tleftZero` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is at least 0, and `right` remains `n`. If `left` is 0, `trightOne` is at least 0, `right` remains `n`, and `tleftZero` is at least 0, potentially less than `(n + 1) // 2` if it was originally less than `(n + 1) // 2`.**
