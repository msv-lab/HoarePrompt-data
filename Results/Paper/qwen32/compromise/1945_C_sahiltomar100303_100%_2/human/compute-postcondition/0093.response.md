The code snippet increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `tleftZero` will be one more than its previous value. Since `tleftZero` was initially less than `(mid + 2) // 2`, after incrementing, it will still be less than `(mid + 2) // 2` unless it reaches that value exactly. The other conditions and values remain the same.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 2) // 2` and `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`**.
