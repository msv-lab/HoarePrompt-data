Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 2) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**
