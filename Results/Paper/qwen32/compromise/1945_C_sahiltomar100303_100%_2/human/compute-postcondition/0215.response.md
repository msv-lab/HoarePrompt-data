Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -3 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is -2; `rightOne` is 4 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 3; `rightZero` is 4 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 2; `leftOne` is -2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 0; `n` is at least 5.**

In natural language: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, so it is now 0. The values of the other variables (`leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
