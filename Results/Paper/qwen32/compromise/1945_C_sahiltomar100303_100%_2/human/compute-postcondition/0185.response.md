The code snippet provided increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `left` is either 0 or not 0
- `right` is either `n` or less than `n`
- `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`
- `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`
- `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`
- `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`
- `mid` must be less than `n`
- `i` is `mid + 2`
- If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 3 and `trightZero` is 3.
- If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightZero` is 1, `rightOne` is 3 and `trightOne` is 4.

The only variable affected by the code snippet `trightZero += 1` is `trightZero`. Therefore, if `trightZero` was initially 3 (when `s[i]` is '0') or 4 (when `s[i]` is not '0'), it will now be 4 or 5, respectively.

Output State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mid + 2`, `trightZero` is either 4 or 5.**
