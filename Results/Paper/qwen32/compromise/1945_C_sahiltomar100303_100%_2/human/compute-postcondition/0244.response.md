Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `left` is 0.
- `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0.
- `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1.
- `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'.
- `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'.
- `right` is 4.
- `tleftZero` is 0.
- `trightOne` is 1.
- `tleftOne` is 1.
- `trightZero` is 1.
- The condition `left == 0` is true.
- Additionally, `right` is not equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(right)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the value of the variable `right`. From the initial state, we know that `right` is explicitly set to 4.

### Output:
The `print(right)` statement will print the value of `right`, which is 4.

Output: **4**
