Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 3, `left` is 0, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:3]` minus 3, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:3]` minus 3, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value of `leftOne` minus 3 if `s[2]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `tleftZero` must be less than 2, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 3, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 3, `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` must be less than `(n - 2) // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is 3, and `s[right]` is '0'**.
