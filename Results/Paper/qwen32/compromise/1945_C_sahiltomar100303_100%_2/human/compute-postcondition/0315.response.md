The code snippet `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the value of `trightZero` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0', and 0 if `s[i]` is not '0'. After the increment, if `s[i]` was '0', `trightZero` becomes 1, and if `s[i]` was not '0', `trightZero` also becomes 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `mid` is the same as the initial value, `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `rightZero` is 4 if `s[i]` is '0', and 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `trightZero` is 1, `rightOne` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0', and 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `trightOne` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0', and 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `i` is `mid + 1`.**
