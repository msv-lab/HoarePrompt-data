The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. The value of `mid` remains unchanged as it is derived from `n` and does not change within the loop.

Given that `mid` is `n // 2`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `mid`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1)**

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is `i + 1`**
