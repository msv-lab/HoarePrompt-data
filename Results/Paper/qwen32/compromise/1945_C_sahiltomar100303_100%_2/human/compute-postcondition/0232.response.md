Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `right` is 2; `n` is at least 2; `tleftZero` is 0 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise -1; `trightOne` is 1 if the character at index `right` of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise -1; `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise 0; `trightZero` is 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the case when `s[right]` is '0' and when it is not.
