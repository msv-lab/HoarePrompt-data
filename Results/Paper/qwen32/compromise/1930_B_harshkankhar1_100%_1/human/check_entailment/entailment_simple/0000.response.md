### Reasoning:
The given program is attempting to generate a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n` such that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` (where `1 ≤ i, j < n` and `i ≠ j`) such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

The program defines a function `func_1` that:
1. Reads an integer `n` (the length of the permutation).
2. Creates a list `a` containing numbers from 1 to `n`.
3. Reverses the elements at even indices of the list `a` (considering 0-based indexing).
4. Prints the resulting list `a`.

Let's analyze the approach with the given example and constraints:
- For `n = 4`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- After reversing elements at even indices (0-based), the list becomes `[4, 2, 1, 3]`.
- For `n = 3`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- After reversing elements at even indices (0-based), the list remains `[1, 2, 3]`.

Now, let's verify if the generated permutations meet the problem's requirements:
- For `n = 4`, the generated permutation is `[4, 2, 1, 3]`.
  - Checking pairs:
    - `4` and `1`: `4` does not divide `1`.
    - `2` and `2`: `2` divides `2`, but `i` must be different from `j`.
    - `1` and `3`: `1` divides `3`, but `2` does not divide `4`.
    - `4` and `3`: `4` does not divide `3`.
    - `2` and `1`: `2` does not divide `1`.
    - `1` and `3`: `1` divides `3`, but `2` does not divide `2`.
  - No pair `(i, j)` violates the condition, so this permutation is valid.

- For `n = 3`, the generated permutation is `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - Checking pairs:
    - `1` and `2`: `1` divides `2`, but `2` does not divide `3`.
    - `2` and `3`: `2` does not divide `3`.
  - No pair `(i, j)` violates the condition, so this permutation is valid.

The approach seems to work for the provided examples. The strategy of reversing elements at even indices ensures that the condition is met because it disrupts the divisibility pattern that could lead to invalid pairs.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly generates a permutation for each test case that satisfies the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
