Functionality: **The function `func_12` calculates and assigns a rank to each node in a graph represented by the dictionary `d`. It returns 1 if the node `da` has only one neighbor. Otherwise, it recursively processes all unvisited neighbors of `da`, calculates the minimum rank among them, and assigns `tmp + 1` to `rank[da - 1]`, where `tmp` is the minimum rank found among the neighbors. The function modifies the `processing` list to keep track of visited nodes and updates the `rank` list with the calculated ranks.**
