Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1)` is greater than 0.**
