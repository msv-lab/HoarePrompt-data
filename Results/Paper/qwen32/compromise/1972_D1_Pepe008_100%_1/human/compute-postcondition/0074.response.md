The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of the variable `suma` by 1. The values of the other variables (`i`, `b`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `b` remains the same
- `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`
- `suma` is `suma + x`

After executing `suma += 1`, the value of `suma` will be `suma + x + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `b` remains the same, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is `suma + x + 1`**
