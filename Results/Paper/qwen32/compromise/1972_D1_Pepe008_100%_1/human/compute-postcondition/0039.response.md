To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head here is `for i in range(1, b + 1)`, so the only variable we can adjust is `i`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, let's call it `i_prev`.
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_prev`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i_prev + 1` must be less than or equal to `b`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted, and no assumptions should be made about variables not in the loop head (like `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `suma`).

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `x` is 3, and `suma` is 4 if the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` holds, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as follows:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `x` is 3, and `suma` is 4 if the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` holds, `i` is incremented by 1**.
