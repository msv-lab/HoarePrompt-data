The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `b` is at least 1 because `range(1, b + 1)` will generate at least one value if `b` is 1 or more.

Given the initial state, `b` is part of the `info` list and is converted to an integer. To ensure the loop executes, `b` must be at least 1. The initial state already mentions that `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, but these do not directly affect the loop's execution.

The variables `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, and `suma` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `b` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0**
