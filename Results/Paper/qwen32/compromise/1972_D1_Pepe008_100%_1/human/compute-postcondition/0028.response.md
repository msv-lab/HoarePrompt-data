The code snippet `info = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `info`. This means the value of `info` will be updated to reflect the new list of substrings obtained from the input. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `a`, `b`, `suma`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to t, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is the accumulated value after all iterations of the loop.**
