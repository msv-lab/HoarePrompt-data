The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `b` is greater than or equal to 1.

To execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `b` should remain the same (as it defines the upper limit of the loop).

Given that at the end of the previous iteration `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`), at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`. The value of `b` remains unchanged.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the exact value of `i`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` (assuming `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration).

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is `x` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is not zero, otherwise `suma` remains 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
