Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the problem and the necessary steps to solve it:

1. **Understanding the Condition**: The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rephrased as:
   \[
   a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
   \]
   for some integer \(k\). This implies:
   \[
   a = (k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) - b = b(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
   \]
   Therefore, \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Iterating Over Possible Values**: For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), we need to find how many valid \(a\) values exist from 1 to \(n\) that satisfy the condition.

3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: For each \(b\), iterate through possible values of \(\gcd(a, b)\) (which must be a divisor of \(b\)). For each divisor \(d\), calculate the number of multiples of \(b \cdot d\) within the range [1, \(n\)].

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it uses a different approach that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_gcd_multiples(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for d in range(1, b + 1):
            if b % d == 0:  # d is a divisor of b
                multiple = b * d
                if multiple > 0:
                    count += n // multiple
    return count

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        print(count_gcd_multiples(n, m))

func()
```

This program correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by iterating through all possible values of \(b\) and their divisors \(d\), and then counting multiples of \(b \cdot d\) within the range [1, \(n\)].
