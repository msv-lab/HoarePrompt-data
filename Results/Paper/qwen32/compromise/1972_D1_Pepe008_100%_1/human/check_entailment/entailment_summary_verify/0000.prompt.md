You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a sum based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`, and then outputs the result minus two.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description and the given code.

### Problem Description Recap

The task is to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis

The provided program iterates over each possible value of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and calculates the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). Here's the critical part of the code:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
    if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
        suma += x
        if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
            suma += 1
```
The code seems to be trying to count the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\) based on some derived formula, but let's check if it correctly implements the problem's condition.

### Potential Issues

1. **Condition Check**: The core condition to check is whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided code does not explicitly check this condition. Instead, it uses a derived formula to count the number of valid \(a\) values, which may not be correct or may have overlooked edge cases.

2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when \(a = 1\) or \(b = 1\), or when \(a\) and \(b\) are very large.

3. **Formula Verification**: The formula used in the code needs to be verified against the problem's condition. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent checks do not seem to directly correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the code with the provided examples to see if it produces the correct output.

#### Test Case 1
Input:
```
1
1 1
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
The code should output `1` as the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\).

#### Test Case 2
Input:
```
1
2 3
```
Expected Output:
```
3
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

#### Test Case 3
Input:
```
1
3 5
```
Expected Output:
```
4
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((3, 1)\), and \((3, 3)\).

#### Test Case 4
Input:
```
1
10 8
```
Expected Output:
```
14
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), and \((10, 2)\).

### Conclusion

Upon reviewing the code and testing with the provided examples, it seems that the code does not correctly implement the problem's condition. The derived formula and checks do not align with the requirement that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**. The code does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) and may not handle edge cases properly.
