Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the given problem. The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Condition**:
   The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
   \[
   a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
   \]
   for some integer \(k\).

2. **Simplifying the Condition**:
   Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\). The condition becomes:
   \[
   d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot d \cdot b' \cdot d \implies a' + b' = k \cdot b' \cdot d
   \]
   This implies \(a' + b'\) must be divisible by \(b' \cdot d\).

3. **Iterating Over Possible Values**:
   The program iterates over possible values of \(b\) and calculates the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). However, the logic inside the loop seems incorrect and overly complicated.

4. **Analysis of the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `suma` to 0 and iterates over possible values of \(i\) (which is actually \(b\) in the problem statement).
   - It calculates `x` as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - It checks if `x` is positive and adds it to `suma`.
   - It also checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\) to add an extra 1 to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

### Issues in the Program

- The formula used to calculate `x` and the conditions to add to `suma` do not correctly reflect the problem's conditions.
- The logic seems to be misguided and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
- The subtraction of 2 at the end is arbitrary and not explained by the logic.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as per the described logic and conditions. The logic inside the loop and the way `suma` is calculated and adjusted do not match the problem requirements.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
