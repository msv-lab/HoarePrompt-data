You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from a specified disk index `i` to explore all disks that are part of the same connected component based on their positions and radii. It updates the `visited` list to mark these disks as visited, populates the `nodes` list with the indices of disks in the connected component, and modifies the `coef0` and `coef1` lists with calculated coefficients. The function modifies these lists in place and does not return any explicit values.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks whether it's possible to adjust the radii of given disks such that:
1. Tangent disks remain tangent.
2. No disks overlap.
3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

### Key Observations:
- If two disks are tangent, the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii.
- To decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency, the radii of the disks must be adjusted in such a way that the tangency condition is preserved, but the overall sum decreases.

### The Given Program:
The program seems to use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore the disks and their tangencies. However, there are a few issues and missing parts in the code:
1. **Global Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `n` are used inside the `dfs` function, but they are not defined within the scope of that function. These should be declared as global or passed as arguments.
2. **DFS Logic**: The DFS is used to explore disks and their tangency. The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to track the relationships between the radii of tangent disks. However, the logic for ensuring the sum of radii decreases is not explicitly implemented.
3. **Condition Checking**: The condition `c1 != 0` is used to determine if it's possible to adjust the radii. This condition seems to be based on the assumption that if there's a way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases, the coefficients will reflect this. However, this is not clearly explained or proven within the code.

### Issues:
- The program does not explicitly check if the sum of radii can decrease while maintaining tangency.
- The logic for determining the feasibility of decreasing the sum of radii is not fully explained or implemented.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the code, particularly the lack of explicit logic to check if the sum of radii can decrease while maintaining tangency, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
