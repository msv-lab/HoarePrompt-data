Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program code, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine if it's possible to change the radii of disks such that:
1. Tangent disks remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap.
3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

### Program Code and Annotations
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `dfs`. The `func_1` function reads the input, initializes necessary data structures, and performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of tangent disks. The `dfs` function marks visited disks and updates coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`).

### Annotations Analysis
- **Initialization**: The program initializes lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`.
- **DFS Execution**: The DFS function is called for each unvisited disk to explore all disks in the same connected component of tangency.
- **Coefficients Calculation**: The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated based on the tangency condition.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims the code is incorrect due to:
1. Use of global variables.
2. Incomplete logic for checking tangency and radii.
3. Failure to handle specific edge cases.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Global Variables**:
   - The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `n` are indeed used globally across `func_1` and `dfs`. This is a poor practice and can lead to bugs, but it does not necessarily mean the logic is incorrect. However, it should be refactored for better practice.

2. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function correctly identifies tangent disks and marks them as visited. It also updates the `coef0` and `coef1` coefficients. These coefficients are used to determine if the sum of radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency.

3. **Logic for Checking Tangency and Radii**:
   - The key logic is in the DFS function where the coefficients are calculated. The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks if disks `i` and `j` are tangent.
   - The coefficients `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` are used to set up a system of equations. The sum of `coef1` for all disks in a connected component is checked to determine if the radii can be adjusted.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The provided code does not explicitly handle all edge cases, but the logic for checking tangency and setting up coefficients should theoretically cover most scenarios.
   - The example provided in the original assessment (`3 disks in a line`) is a valid test case. The code should correctly identify that it's impossible to decrease the radii while maintaining tangency.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies the poor practice of using global variables and the incomplete handling of edge cases. However, the core logic for checking tangency and setting up coefficients seems to be on the right track. The code does not explicitly solve the system of equations to check if the sum of radii can be decreased, but the setup of coefficients is a step in the right direction.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is partially correct in identifying issues with global variables and edge cases. However, the core logic for checking tangency and setting up coefficients is not fundamentally flawed. The code does not fully solve the problem as described, but it is not entirely incorrect either.

Given the annotations and the logic, the program is not fully correct as it does not solve the system of equations to check if the sum of radii can be decreased. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
