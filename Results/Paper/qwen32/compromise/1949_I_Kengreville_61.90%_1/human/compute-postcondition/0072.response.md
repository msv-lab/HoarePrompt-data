The code snippet `ok = ok or c1 != 0` updates the variable `ok` based on its current value and the condition `c1 != 0`. If `ok` is already `True`, it remains `True`. If `ok` is `False`, it becomes `True` only if `c1` is not equal to `0`.

Given this, the output state will depend on the initial value of `ok` and the value of `c1`.

Output State: **`c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`; `ok` is `True` if `ok` was initially `True` or if `c1` is not equal to `0`.**
