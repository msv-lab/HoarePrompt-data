The provided code snippet increments the variable `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. However, the variable `j` is not defined in the initial state or in the provided code snippet, which means the value of `c1` cannot be precisely determined without knowing the value of `j`. Given the context, I will assume that `j` is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code and is within the bounds of the list `coef1`.

Given the initial state, the value of `c1` is initially `2 * coef1[j]`. After executing the code `c1 += coef1[j]`, the new value of `c1` becomes `2 * coef1[j] + coef1[j]`, which simplifies to `3 * coef1[j]`.

Since the value of `j` is not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `c1`, but we can express it in terms of `coef1[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which is `True`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[0]` which is `0`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[0]` which is `1`; `nodes` is a list containing `[1, 2]`; `i` is 0; `ok` is False; `c0` is 0; `c1` is `3 * coef1[j]`.**
