The code snippet `c0 += coef0[j]` modifies the value of `c0` by adding the value of `coef0[j]` to it. Given the initial state, `j` is 3, so `c0` will be updated to `c0 + coef0[3]`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with `visited[1]` which is `True` and possibly `visited[0]` which is `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with `coef0[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef0[0]` which is `0` if it was initially `False`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with `coef1[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef1[0]` which is `1` if it was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list which must have at least one element; `i` is 1; `ok` is `False` unless `visited[0]` was initially `False` and `dfs(i)` modifies it; `c0` is `0` plus `coef0[3]` plus `coef0[j]`; `c1` is `coef1[j]` plus `coef1[j]`; `j` is 3**.

In simpler terms, `c0` has been updated to include `coef0[3]` in its value. All other variables remain unchanged.
