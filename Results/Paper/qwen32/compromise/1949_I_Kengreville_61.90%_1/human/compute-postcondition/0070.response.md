Output State: **`j` is the next element in `nodes`; `c0` is updated to `c0 + coef0[j]`; `c1` is updated to `c1 + coef1[j]`.**

In natural language, this means that `j` remains the next element in the `nodes` list, `c0` has been incremented by the value of `coef0[j]`, and `c1` has been incremented by the value of `coef1[j]`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
