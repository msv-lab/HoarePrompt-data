Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with `visited[1]` set to `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of `None` values with `coef0[1]` and `coef1[1]` possibly updated if `visited[1]` was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list which may have elements added to it; `i` is 1; `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not equal to `0`, otherwise `False`; `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`. If `visited[1]` was initially `False`, `visited[1]` is now `True`, and `coef0[1]` and `coef1[1]` may have been updated, and `ok` is determined based on the value of `c1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `ok`, `c0`, or `c1`.**
