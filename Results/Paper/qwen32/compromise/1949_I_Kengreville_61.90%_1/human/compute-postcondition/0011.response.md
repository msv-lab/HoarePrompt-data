The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was some value such that the loop condition was satisfied. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n, `n` must be greater than 0, `dx` is x[i] - x[j], `dy` is y[i] - y[j]. If `visited[j]` is False and `(r[i] + r[j])`. `j` is now `j + 1`**
