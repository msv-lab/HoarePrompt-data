Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with `visited[1]` set to `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of `None` values with `coef0[1]` and `coef1[1]` possibly updated if `visited[1]` was initially `False`; `coef0[2]` is 0; `coef1[2]` is 1; `nodes` is an empty list; `i` is 2; `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not equal to `0`, otherwise `False`; `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that the `nodes` list is reset to an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values.
