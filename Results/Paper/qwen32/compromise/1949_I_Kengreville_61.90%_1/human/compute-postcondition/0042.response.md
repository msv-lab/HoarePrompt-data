The code snippet provided initializes the variable `c1` to `0`. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `i`, `ok`, and `c0` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[1]` which is `True` and possibly `visited[0]` which is `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef0[0]` which is `0` if it was initially `False`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef1[0]` which is `1` if it was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list which may have elements added to it; `i` is 1; `ok` is `False` unless `visited[0]` was initially `False` and `dfs(i)` modifies it; `c0` is `0`; `c1` is `0`.**
