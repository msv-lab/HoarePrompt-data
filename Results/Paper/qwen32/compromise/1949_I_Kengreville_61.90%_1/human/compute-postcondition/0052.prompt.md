Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[1]` which is `True` and possibly `visited[0]` which is `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef0[0]` which is `0` if it was initially `False`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef1[0]` which is `1` if it was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list which may have elements added to it; `i` is 1; `ok` is `False` unless `visited[0]` was initially `False` and `dfs(i)` modifies it; `c0` is `0`; `c1` is `0`.
Code of the loop:
for j in nodes:
    c0 += coef0[j]
    c1 += coef1[j]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with `visited[1]` which is `True` and possibly `visited[0]` which is `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with `coef0[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef0[0]` which is `0` if it was initially `False`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with `coef1[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef1[0]` which is `1` if it was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list which must have at least one element; `i` is 1; `ok` is `False` unless `visited[0]` was initially `False` and `dfs(i)` modifies it; `c0` is `0` plus `coef0[j]`; `c1` is `coef1[j]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with `visited[1]` which is `True` and possibly `visited[0]` which is `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with `coef0[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef0[0]` which is `0` if it was initially `False`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with `coef1[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef1[0]` which is `1` if it was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list which must have at least one element; `i` is 1; `ok` is `False` unless `visited[0]` was initially `False` and `dfs(i)` modifies it; `c0` is `0` plus `coef0[j]`; `c1` is `coef1[j]` plus `coef1[j]`; `j` is the next element in `nodes` after 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with `visited[1]` which is `True` and possibly `visited[0]` which is `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with `coef0[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef0[0]` which is `0` if it was initially `False`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with `coef1[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef1[0]` which is `1` if it was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list which must have at least one element; `i` is 1; `ok` is `False` unless `visited[0]` was initially `False` and `dfs(i)` modifies it; `c0` is `0` plus `coef0[3]` plus `coef0[j]`; `c1` is `coef1[j]` plus `coef1[j]` plus `coef1[3]`; `j` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
