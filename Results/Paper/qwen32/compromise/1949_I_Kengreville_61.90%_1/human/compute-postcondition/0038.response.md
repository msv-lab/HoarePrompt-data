Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except possibly `visited[0]` which is `True` if `visited[0]` was initially `False`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except possibly `coef0[0]` which is `0` if `visited[0]` was initially `False` and `coef0[1]` is `0`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[0]` which is `1` if `visited[0]` was initially `False` and `coef1[1]` is `1`; `nodes` is a list that is either empty or contains `[0]` if `visited[0]` was initially `False`; `i` is 1; `ok` is `False` unless `visited[0]` was initially `False`, in which case `ok` is `True`.**

In natural language: The value of `coef1[1]` has been set to `1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
