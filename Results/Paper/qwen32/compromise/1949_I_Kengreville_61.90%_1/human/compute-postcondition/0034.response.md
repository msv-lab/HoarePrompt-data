Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which is `True`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[0]` which is `0`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[0]` which is `1`; `nodes` is a list containing `[0]`; `i` is 0; `ok` is True; `c0` is 0; `c1` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `ok` is updated to `True` because the expression `ok or c1 != 0` evaluates to `True` given that `c1` is `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
