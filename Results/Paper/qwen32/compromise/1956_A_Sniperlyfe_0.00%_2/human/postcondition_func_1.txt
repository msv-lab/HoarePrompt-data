The function reads multiple test cases where each test case consists of a number of rounds `k`, a number `q`, a list `p` of positions of players to be kicked out, and a list `qs` of initial player counts. For each initial player count in `qs`, it computes the result of a function `func_1` which presumably determines the position of the last remaining player after the specified rounds of kicking out players. It prints the results for each initial player count in the test case.
