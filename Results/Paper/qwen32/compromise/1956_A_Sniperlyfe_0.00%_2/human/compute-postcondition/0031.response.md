The only object in the loop head is the loop variable `_` and the range variable `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable (not used in the loop body), the only state we need to adjust is `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Given that `t` determines the number of iterations, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, we do not have information on the exact value of `t`, but we know that it was decremented by 1. Therefore, to execute one more iteration, `t` must be at least 1 before the decrement.

State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the last element in the new `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, `t` is at least 1**
