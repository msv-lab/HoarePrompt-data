The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Given that `res` initially contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, after the execution, `res` will contain the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times.

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `qs[1]`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times, `t` is at least 1.**
