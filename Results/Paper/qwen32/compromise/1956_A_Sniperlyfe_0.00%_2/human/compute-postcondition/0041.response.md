To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `k` is the first integer from the input.
2. `q` is the second integer from the input.
3. `n` is the next element in `qs`.
4. `p` is a new list of integers read from the input.
5. `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements.
6. `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice.
7. `t` is at least 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`res`**: The variable `res` is a list that contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice. This means `res` is of the form `[result, result]` where `result` is the output of the function `func_1(n, p)`.

2. **`map(str, res)`**: The `map` function applies the `str` function to each element in `res`. Since `res` contains two identical elements, this will convert both elements to strings. So, if `result` is `x`, then `map(str, res)` will produce `['x', 'x']`.

3. **`' '.join(...)`**: The `join` method concatenates the elements of the list into a single string, with each element separated by a space. Therefore, `' '.join(['x', 'x'])` will produce the string `'x x'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the string `'x x'` where `x` is the string representation of the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Final Output:
Output: **result result (where result is the string representation of the output of func_1(n, p))**
