The provided code snippet updates the variable `p` by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and then storing these integers in a list. The other variables (`k`, `q`, `n`, `qs`, `res`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing as many elements as there are in `qs`, with each element being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.**
