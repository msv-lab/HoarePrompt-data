The code snippet appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Given the initial state, `res` initially contains two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`. After the code is executed, `res` will have three elements, with the third element being the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`n` is the next element in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least two elements, `res` is a list containing three elements, all of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.
