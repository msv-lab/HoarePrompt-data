### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic of both `func_1` and `func_2` in the context of the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function simulates the rounds of the game, reducing the number of players `n` based on the positions `p` where players are kicked out.
   - **Logic**: 
     - The function runs a loop while `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest position in `p` (`min(p)`).
     - In each iteration, it calculates how many players are kicked out in that round by counting the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.
     - It then subtracts this count from `n`.
     - The loop continues until `n` is less than `min(p)`.
     - The final value of `n` is returned, which represents the number of players remaining after no more players can be kicked out.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a sequence of positions `p` and a list of initial player counts `qs`. For each initial player count, it computes the number of remaining players using `func_1` and prints the results.
   - **Logic**:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `k` (length of `p`), `q` (number of initial player counts), the list `p`, and the list `qs`.
     - For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to compute the number of remaining players and appends the result to `res`.
     - It prints the results for each test case.

### Issues in the Code:
- **Output Issue in `func_2()`**: The print statement inside the loop for each `n` in `qs` is incorrect. It should print all results for the current test case after processing all `n` in `qs`, not after processing each `n`. The current implementation will print intermediate results, which is not what the problem requires.
- **Correct Output**: The print statement should be moved outside the inner loop that processes each `n` in `qs` to ensure that all results for a test case are printed together.

### Corrected `func_2()`:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Conclusion:
The logic of `func_1` is correct, but `func_2` has an issue with the print statement, which causes it to output intermediate results instead of the final result for each test case. Therefore, the program as given is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
