### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated states.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store values for constraints of type 3 (k ≠ x).
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (1000000000 + 7) and `bx` to -1. These will store the maximum value for constraints of type 1 (k ≥ x) and the minimum value for constraints of type 2 (k ≤ x), respectively.

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`.
   - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`.
   - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Calculating Valid k Values**:
   - After reading all constraints, it checks if `bx` (the minimum k allowed by constraints of type 1) is greater than or equal to `ax` (the maximum k allowed by constraints of type 2). If so, it means there are no valid k values, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid k values by counting how many numbers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) are not in the set `cx`. This is done by iterating over the set `cx` and checking if each value is within the range `[bx, ax]`. It increments a temporary counter `tmp` for each such value.
   - Finally, it appends the result `(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)` to the result list `r`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results stored in the list `r`, with each result on a new line.

### Correctness Analysis:

- The logic for determining the range of valid k values (`[bx, ax]`) is correct. `bx` is the smallest k that satisfies all constraints of type 1, and `ax` is the largest k that satisfies all constraints of type 2.
- The check `if bx >= ax` correctly identifies when there are no valid k values.
- The calculation of the number of valid k values by subtracting the count of excluded values (those in `cx` and within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total number of values in the range `[bx, ax]` is also correct.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
