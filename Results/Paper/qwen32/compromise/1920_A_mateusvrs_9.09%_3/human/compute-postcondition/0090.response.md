The given code snippet increments the variable `tmp` by 1. However, `tmp` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `tmp` was intended to be `n` (as it's the only integer variable mentioned), the code would increment `n` by 1.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the updated state would be:

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was `1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was `3` and contains at least one element, `n` is `1`, `r` includes the new element `1000000009`, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the next element from `cx` that hasn't been processed yet.`**

In simpler terms: The value of `n` has been incremented by 1, making it `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
