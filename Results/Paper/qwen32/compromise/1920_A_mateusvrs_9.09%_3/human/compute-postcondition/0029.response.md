The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Given the initial conditions, if `a` is 1 or 3, `cx` was initially an empty set. If `a` is 2, `cx` was initially a set containing the integer `x`.

After executing `cx.add(x)`, the set `cx` will contain the integer `x` regardless of its initial state. Here’s the breakdown:

- If `a` was 1 or 3, `cx` was empty and now contains `x`.
- If `a` was 2, `cx` already contained `x` (since it was initialized with `x`), and adding `x` again does not change the set.

Therefore, after the code executes, `cx` will definitely contain the integer `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `r` is an empty list; `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`; `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or 3, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`; `bx` is `x` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.**
