The code assigns the value `1000000000.0 + 7` to the variable `ax`. Since `1000000000.0 + 7` is a floating-point operation, it results in `1000000007.0`. However, since the variable name suggests an integer context (`ax`), it's reasonable to assume the value is intended to be an integer. Thus, `ax` is effectively `1000000007`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `r`, and `cx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case; all pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case; `r` is an empty list; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is 1000000007.**
