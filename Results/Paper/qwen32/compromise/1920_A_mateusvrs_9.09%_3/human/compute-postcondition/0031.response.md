Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `r` is an empty list; if `a` is 1 or 3, `cx` is an empty set, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`; `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or 3, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`; `bx` is `x` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. If `a` is 2, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, otherwise `cx` remains an empty set.**
