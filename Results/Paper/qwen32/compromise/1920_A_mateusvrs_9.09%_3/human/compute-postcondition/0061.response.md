The code snippet updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given that `ax` is initially `1000000007` and `x` is the second integer from the input, the new value of `ax` will be the smaller of these two numbers.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we cannot determine if `ax` will remain `1000000007` or change to `x`. However, we can express the final state in terms of `x`.

If `x` is less than or equal to `1000000007`, then `ax` will be updated to `x`. Otherwise, `ax` will remain `1000000007`.

Output State: **`a` is 2, `bx` is -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000000007`, `cx` is an empty set, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` includes the new element 1000000009, and `x` is the second integer from the input.**
