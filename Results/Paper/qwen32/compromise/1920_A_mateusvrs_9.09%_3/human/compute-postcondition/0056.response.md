The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `a` and `x`. The initial state does not specify the values of `a` and `x`, so these will be determined by the input. The other variables (`bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `n`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `r` includes the new element 1000000009, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input.**
