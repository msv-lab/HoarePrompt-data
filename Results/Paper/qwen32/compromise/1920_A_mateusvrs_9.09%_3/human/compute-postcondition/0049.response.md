Postcondition: **`bx` and `ax` are integers. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` has an additional element `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
