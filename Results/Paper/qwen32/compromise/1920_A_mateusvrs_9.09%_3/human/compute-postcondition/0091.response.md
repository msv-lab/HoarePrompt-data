Postcondition: **`bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was `1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was `3` and contains at least one element, `r` includes the new element `1000000009`, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the next element from `cx` that hasn't been processed yet. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, `n` is `1`; otherwise, `n` remains `0`.**
