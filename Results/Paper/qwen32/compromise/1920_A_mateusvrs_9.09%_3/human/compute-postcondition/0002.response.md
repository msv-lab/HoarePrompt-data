In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution directly. The other variables mentioned (`n`, constraints, and `r`) are not part of the loop header and thus cannot be adjusted to control the loop's execution.

Given this, the only variable in the loop header is `_`, and the loop will execute `t` times based on the value of `t`. Since `t` is already defined as being between 1 and 500, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute, and no changes are necessary to the state of `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case; all pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case; `r` is an empty list.**
