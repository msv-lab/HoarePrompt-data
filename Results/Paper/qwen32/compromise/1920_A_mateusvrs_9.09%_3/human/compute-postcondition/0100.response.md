The given code snippet resets the `cx` variable to an empty set. This means that all previously stored unique `x` values encountered when `a` was `3` are removed.

Here's the updated state:

- `bx` remains the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was `1`.
- `ax` remains the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was `2`.
- `cx` is now an empty set.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `r` includes the element `1000000009` and potentially other elements based on the conditions involving `bx`, `ax`, and `cx`.

Since `cx` is reset, the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive (`tmp`) would now be `0` if the condition to add `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to `r` is evaluated again.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was `1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was `2`, `cx` is an empty set, `n` is an input integer, and `r` includes the element `1000000009`. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` also includes the element `0`. If `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` also includes the element `ax - bx + 1` (since `tmp` is now `0`).**
