The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements in the set `cx`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `i` and how it relates to the set `cx`.

Given:
- `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values when `a` is neither `1` nor `2` and must contain at least one element.
- `i` is currently an element from `cx` at the end of the previous iteration.

Since `i` iterates over each element in `cx`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `cx` that hasn't been processed yet.

Let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`. The next value of `i` (`i_next`) should be the next element in `cx` after `i_current`. However, since sets are unordered collections, we cannot directly determine the "next" element without additional context or ordering. But for the purpose of this task, we assume that `i` takes on each value in `cx` exactly once in some order.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be set to the next element in `cx` after `i_current`.

State: **`bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a` is `1`, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a` is `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` when `a` is neither `1` nor `2` and must contain at least one element, `n` is the input integer, and `r` includes `1000000009` and possibly `0`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is `1`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains `0`. `i` is the next element in `cx` after the current `i`.**
