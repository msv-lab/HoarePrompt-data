Given the initial state, `r` is a list containing `t` integers, each derived from the constraints of one test case. The `print` statement uses the unpacking operator `*` to print each element of the list `r` on a new line due to the `sep='\n'` argument.

Let's break down the components:

- `r`: This is a list of integers.
- `t`: This is the number of integers in the list `r`.

Since the exact values of the integers in `r` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical output. However, we know that the `print` statement will output each integer in the list `r` on a separate line.

Therefore, the output will be a series of integers, each on a new line, corresponding to the elements of the list `r`.

Output: **Each integer in the list `r` on a new line (where `r` is a list of `t` integers)**
