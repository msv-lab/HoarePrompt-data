Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    112 777
    
    5 12

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

for i in range(T):
    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12).
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if 1 + i > k:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(-k, x)
            return l
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        x = l[-1]
        
        l.pop(-1)
        
        l.insert(0, x)
        
    #State: l is a rotated version of the initial list based on the value of k.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer. It returns a list that is a rotated version of the list `[1, 2, ..., n]` based on the value of `k`. The rotation is determined by a specific algorithm that manipulates the list elements according to the value of `k`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= (n^2 // 2) if n is even, and 0 <= k <= ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if n is odd.
def func_2():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= (n^2 // 2) if n is even, and 0 <= k <= ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if n is odd. Additionally, `k` is even.
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if `n` is odd, and 0 <= k <= (n^2 // 2) if `n` is even. Additionally, `k` is even. `max_k` is set to ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if `n` is odd, and `max_k` is set to (n^2 // 2) if `n` is even.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if `n` is odd, and 0 <= k <= (n^2 // 2) if `n` is even. Additionally, `k` is even. `max_k` is set to ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if `n` is odd, and `max_k` is set to (n^2 // 2) if `n` is even. `k` is less than or equal to `max_k`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns the positive integer `n` and the non-negative even integer `k` where `k` is less than or equal to `max_k`. `max_k` is set to ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if `n` is odd, and `max_k` is set to (n^2 // 2) if `n` is even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `n` (a positive integer) and `k` (a non-negative integer). It returns `0, 0` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds the maximum allowed value `max_k`. Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`, where `k` is a non-negative even integer and `k` is less than or equal to `max_k`. The value of `max_k` is calculated as ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if `n` is odd, and (n^2 // 2) if `n` is even.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, where each integer is distinct and in the range from 1 to n.
def func_3(l):
    print('YES')
    #This is printed: YES
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: the integers in the list l are printed in the same order, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
    return
    #The program returns nothing (None)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, where each integer is distinct and in the range from 1 to `n`. It prints the integers in the list in the same order, separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function returns nothing (None).

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12).
def func_4():
    n, k = func_2()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing (None)
    #State: `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`. `n` is not equal to 0.
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns nothing (None)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` retrieves values `n` and `k` from `func_2`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it processes `n` and `k` through `func_1` to get a list `l`, then passes `l` to `func_3`. The function `func_4` returns `None` in all cases.
