### Reasoning:
To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze each function and how they collectively solve the problem.

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It first checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `0, 0` because the Manhattan value cannot be odd for any permutation.
   - It then calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`. The formula used depends on whether `n` is odd or even.
   - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `0, 0` because `k` is out of the possible range.
   - Otherwise, it returns the original `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It divides `k` by 2 because the algorithm used to generate the permutation operates with half the value of `k`.
   - It initializes a list `l` as the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - The function iterates over the list in reverse order, performing a series of rotations based on the value of `k`.
   - The rotations are designed to incrementally increase the Manhattan value of the permutation until it reaches `k`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l` if a valid permutation is found.
   - It simply prints the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the process.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the values of `n` and `k`. If `n` is `0`, it means `k` was invalid, and it prints "NO".
   - If `n` is not `0`, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print it.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the case where `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value by returning `0, 0` from `func_2`.
- The algorithm in `func_1` is designed to generate a permutation with the specified Manhattan value `k` by performing strategic rotations.
- The functions `func_3` and `func_4` are straightforward and ensure that the output is formatted correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a permutation with the specified Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
