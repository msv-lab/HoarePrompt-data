Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function checks if `k` is even, since the Manhattan value of a permutation is always even. However, it returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd, which is correct.
   - The function calculates `max_k` as the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. The formula used for `max_k` is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
     - For odd `n`: `max_k = (n * (n - 1)) // 2`
     - For even `n`: `max_k = (n * (n - 1)) // 2`
   - The current implementation incorrectly uses `max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2` for odd `n` and `max_k = n ** 2 // 2` for even `n`, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function attempts to construct a permutation with the given Manhattan value `k`. However, the logic for constructing the permutation is flawed.
   - The function halves `k` at the beginning, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
   - The logic for adjusting the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value is incorrect and does not guarantee a valid permutation for all values of `k`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is correctly printing the permutation if one is found.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_2` to validate the input and `func_1` to generate the permutation. Since `func_2` and `func_1` have issues, this function will not always produce the correct output.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs, and therefore the correctness is **False**.
