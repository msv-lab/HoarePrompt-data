Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective**: Given integers `n` and `k`, find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that its Manhattan value is equal to `k`, or determine that no such permutation exists.
2. **Manhattan Value**: Defined as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).
3. **Constraints**:
   - \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \) (number of test cases)
   - \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \)
   - \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^{12} \)
4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output "No" if no suitable permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, output "Yes" followed by the permutation.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
   - Checks if `k` is odd. If yes, returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
   - Computes the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for the given `n`:
     - \( max_k = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) if `n` is odd.
     - \( max_k = \frac{n^2}{2} \) if `n` is even.
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
   - Otherwise, returns `(n, k)` indicating a potential solution exists.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Constructs a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value equal to `k`.
   - The algorithm works by iteratively adjusting the permutation to increase its Manhattan value.
   - The key steps include:
     - Dividing `k` by 2.
     - Iterating from the end of the list to the beginning.
     - Adjusting elements to increase the Manhattan value until `k` becomes 0.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - Prints "YES" followed by the permutation if a solution is found.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - Calls `func_2` to determine if a solution exists.
   - If no solution exists (i.e., `n == 0`), prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, calls `func_1` to construct the permutation and `func_3` to print it.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Parity Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, no permutation can achieve this Manhattan value, as the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.

2. **Maximum Manhattan Value Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `max_k` is correct. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is indeed \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\) for odd `n` and \(\frac{n^2}{2}\) for even `n`.

3. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The algorithm in `func_1` is intended to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value. However, the logic for adjusting the permutation is complex and may not be correct for all cases.
   - The method of dividing `k` by 2 and adjusting the permutation is not straightforward and may not guarantee a correct permutation for all valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:

While the program correctly handles the parity check and the maximum Manhattan value calculation, the permutation construction algorithm in `func_1` is not guaranteed to produce a valid permutation for all valid `k` values. Therefore, the program may not always produce a correct solution.

**Correctness: False**
