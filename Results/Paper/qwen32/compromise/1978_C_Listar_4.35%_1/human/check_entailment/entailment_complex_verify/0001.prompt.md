You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer. It returns a list that is a rotated version of the list `[1, 2, ..., n]` based on the value of `k`. The rotation is determined by a specific algorithm that manipulates the list elements according to the value of `k`.

Additionally, `k` is even. `max_k` is set to ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if `n` is odd, and `max_k` is set to (n^2 // 2) if `n` is even. `k` is less than or equal to `max_k`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `n` (a positive integer) and `k` (a non-negative integer). It returns `0, 0` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds the maximum allowed value `max_k`. Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`, where `k` is a non-negative even integer and `k` is less than or equal to `max_k`. The value of `max_k` is calculated as ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if `n` is odd, and (n^2 // 2) if `n` is even.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, where each integer is distinct and in the range from 1 to `n`. It prints the integers in the list in the same order, separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function returns nothing (None).

    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns nothing (None)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` retrieves values `n` and `k` from `func_2`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it processes `n` and `k` through `func_1` to get a list `l`, then passes `l` to `func_3`. The function `func_4` returns `None` in all cases.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic and implementation of the four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`. Here is the step-by-step analysis:

### Function 1: `func_1(n, k)`

This function is supposed to generate a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`. The function first divides `k` by 2. Then, it creates a list `l` containing the numbers from 1 to `n`. It iterates over the list in reverse order, adjusting the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

However, the logic inside the loop is not clear and seems to be incorrect or incomplete. The function attempts to manipulate the list based on the value of `k`, but it does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the exact Manhattan value `k`. The condition `if 1 + i > k` is not well-explained and does not seem to correctly handle the case where `k` needs to be reduced.

### Function 2: `func_2()`

This function reads the input values `n` and `k` for a test case. It checks if `k` is odd, and if so, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating that no such permutation exists because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even. It then calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` and checks if `k` is greater than this maximum value. If `k` is too large, it returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

The logic here seems correct. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is indeed `n^2 // 2` (or `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd) because the maximum deviation of each element from its position is `n-1`, and there are `n` elements.

### Function 3: `func_3(l)`

This function takes a list `l` and prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list on a single line. This part of the program is correct and does what it is intended to do.

### Function 4: `func_4()`

This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_2()` to get the values of `n` and `k` for the current test case. If `n` is 0 (which indicates that no valid permutation exists), it prints "NO". Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3(l)` to print the result.

### Overall Analysis

The main issue lies in `func_1(n, k)`. The logic for generating the permutation with the exact Manhattan value `k` is unclear and likely incorrect. The function does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the correct Manhattan value, and the conditions inside the loop do not seem to handle all cases properly.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program is not guaranteed to produce correct results for all inputs because `func_1(n, k)` does not correctly generate the permutation with the desired Manhattan value `k`.
