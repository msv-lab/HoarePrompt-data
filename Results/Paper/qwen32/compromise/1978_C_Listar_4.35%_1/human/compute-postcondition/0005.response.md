Output State: **`n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`. `n` is not equal to 0; `l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`.**

Natural Language: The values of `n` and `k` remain as the return values of `func_2()`, and `n` is still not equal to 0. A new variable `l` is introduced and assigned the return value of `func_1(n, k)`.
