Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer) and `k` (a non-negative integer). It returns `0, 0` in two unspecified cases. Otherwise, it returns the positive integer `n` and the non-negative even integer `k`, where `k` is less than or equal to `max_k`. Here, `max_k` is calculated as ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if `n` is odd, and (n^2 // 2) if `n` is even.**
