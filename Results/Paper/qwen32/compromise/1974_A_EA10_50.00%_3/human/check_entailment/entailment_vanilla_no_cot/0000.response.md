Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. Let's go through the logic and identify the issues:

1. **Calculation of `z`**: The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`, which seems to be an attempt to determine how many screens are needed for the `2x2` icons. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that each screen can hold a maximum of one `2x2` icon (since a `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells, and a `5x3` screen has only 15 cells, it can fit at most one `2x2` icon).

2. **Calculation of `m`**: The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`, which is clearly incorrect because it doesn't make logical sense in the context of the problem. The value `m` is supposed to represent the remaining space after placing the `2x2` icons, but the formula used does not achieve this.

3. **Logic for remaining `1x1` icons**: The logic for placing the remaining `1x1` icons is flawed. The condition `if m < a` is incorrect because `a` is the number of test cases, not the remaining space. The correct logic should be to calculate the remaining space after placing the `2x2` icons and then determine how many screens are needed for the `1x1` icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        screens = y  # Each 2x2 icon needs one screen
        remaining_space = 15 * screens - y * 4  # Calculate remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        if remaining_space < x:  # If not enough space for all 1x1 icons
            screens += (x - remaining_space + 14) // 15  # Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        print(screens)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- We start by allocating one screen for each `2x2` icon.
- We then calculate the remaining space after placing the `2x2` icons.
- If there is not enough space for all `1x1` icons, we calculate how many additional screens are needed for the remaining `1x1` icons.
