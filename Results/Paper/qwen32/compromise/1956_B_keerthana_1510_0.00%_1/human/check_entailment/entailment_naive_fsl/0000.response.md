Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The program attempts to count the number of times each card appears and then divides this count by 3, which is not the correct approach to determine the maximum number of points you can get.

The program should simulate the game where you and Nene take turns, and you need to maximize your points by choosing cards optimally. Nene will also choose cards optimally to maximize her points and minimize yours.

Here is a brief outline of what the correct program should do:
1. Count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
2. Simulate the game by alternating turns between you and Nene.
3. Keep track of the cards already on the table.
4. Choose cards in a way that maximizes your points while considering Nene's optimal moves.

The provided program does not simulate the game or account for the optimal strategies of both players. It simply counts the occurrences of each card and divides by 3, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
4
1 1 2 3

Expected Output:
1

Actual Output of Provided Program:
0
```

In this example, the program should output `1` because you can score 1 point by playing optimally. However, the provided program outputs `0`, which is incorrect. This demonstrates that the program does not correctly simulate the game or account for the optimal strategies of both players.
