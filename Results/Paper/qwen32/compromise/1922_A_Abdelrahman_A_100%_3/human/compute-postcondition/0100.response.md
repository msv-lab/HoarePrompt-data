Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is the new input value; `b` is the new input value; `c` is the new input value from `input()`. `i` is the current iteration index + 2. `no` is True, meaning `c` does not equal `a` or `b`, and at least one `x` in `c` was not found in `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`. `counter` is equal to the length of `c`.**
