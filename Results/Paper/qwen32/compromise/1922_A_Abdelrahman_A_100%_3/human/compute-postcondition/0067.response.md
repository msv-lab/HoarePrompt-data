The provided initial state includes several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `tests`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, or `no`. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes a series of variables and conditions but does not affect the `print` statement directly.
2. The `print('NO')` statement is a direct output of the string `'NO'` regardless of the state of other variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
