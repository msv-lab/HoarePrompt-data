### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (length of the strings) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If it is, it immediately prints "NO" and moves to the next test case. This is because if `c` matches `a` or `b`, there cannot be a template where `c` does not match while `a` and `b` do.

3. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, the program iterates through each character in `c` and checks if the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the character in `c`.
   - If for any character in `c`, the corresponding characters in both `a` and `b` are the same as the character in `c`, it means that no template can be formed where `c` does not match while `a` and `b` do. In this case, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without printing "NO", it means that for every character in `c`, there is a difference in the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` from `c`. Hence, it prints "YES".

### Analysis of the Given Program:

- **Correctness of the Initial Check:**
  - The initial check correctly identifies when `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, ensuring that no template can satisfy the condition.

- **Logic for Template Matching:**
  - The program correctly checks if each character in `c` has a different character in either `a` or `b` at the corresponding position. If any character in `c` does not have a difference in both `a` and `b`, it correctly prints "NO".
  - If the loop completes without finding any such character, it correctly prints "YES".

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not. The logic and the conditions are correctly handled, and the output matches the problem requirements.

### Your Response:

Correctness: **True**
