In the provided for loop:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. This value needs to be a non-negative integer that dictates the number of iterations the loop will perform.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, the input is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm".

To ensure the loop executes, the value of `t` should be used as the input to `int(input())`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input function will return `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and the next input to `int(input())` will be `t`**.
