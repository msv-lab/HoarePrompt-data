The input consists of two integers N and M (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, and both are odd) representing the dimensions of the field. This is followed by N lines, each containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces, representing the initial state of the field. Each pair of characters can be ".." (empty cell), "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" (players), "RG" or "BG" (goals), or ".Q" (Quaffle). After the field description, there is an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000) representing the number of steps in the game. This is followed by T lines, each describing an action with a pair of characters representing the entity performing the action, and a description of the action (U, D, L, R for movement, C for catching a ball followed by the ball's description, T for throwing the Quaffle).
