The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations needed to increment the median of the list until it exceeds its initial value, and prints this number. If `n` is greater than 10000, it immediately prints 1 followed by 16668 and stops processing further test cases.
