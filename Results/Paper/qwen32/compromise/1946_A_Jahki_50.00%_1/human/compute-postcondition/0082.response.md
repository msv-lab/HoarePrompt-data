The code snippet `new_median = median` assigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. This means that the value of `new_median` is now the same as the value of `median`.

Given the initial state, `median` is defined as `b[ma]`, where `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a`, and `ma` is calculated based on whether `num2` is even or odd.

Therefore, after executing the code snippet, `new_median` will have the same value as `median`, which is `b[ma]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `op` is 0, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is `b[ma]`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**.
