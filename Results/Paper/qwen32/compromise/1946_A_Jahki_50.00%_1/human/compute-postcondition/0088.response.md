To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The loop will continue to execute as long as `new_median <= median`.

Given the current state:
- `new_median` is `b[ma]`
- `median` is `b[ma] + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `new_median <= median` must be true. Since `median` is defined as `b[ma] + 1`, this condition is inherently true because `b[ma]` (which is `new_median`) will always be less than `b[ma] + 1`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the values of `new_median` or `median` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. The state remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `op` is 1, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**
