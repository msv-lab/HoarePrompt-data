Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 3, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 3, `median` is `median`, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 2`**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the value of `op` has been incremented by 1, making its new value 3. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
