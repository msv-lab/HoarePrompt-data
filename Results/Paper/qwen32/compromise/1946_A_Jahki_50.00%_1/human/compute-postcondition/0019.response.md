To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `new_median <= median`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`
- `num` is greater than 0
- `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0
- `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a`
- If `num2` is even, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. Otherwise, `num2` is odd, and `ma` is the integer part of `num2 / 2`
- `median` is `b[ma]`
- `new_median` is `median`

The loop condition `new_median <= median` will always be true initially because `new_median` is initialized to `median`. To make the loop execute, we need to adjust either `new_median` or `median` so that `new_median` is not less than or equal to `median`.

Since `new_median` is initialized to `median`, we need to change `new_median` to be greater than `median`. The simplest way to do this is to adjust `new_median` directly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is `b[ma]`, `new_median` is greater than `median`**
