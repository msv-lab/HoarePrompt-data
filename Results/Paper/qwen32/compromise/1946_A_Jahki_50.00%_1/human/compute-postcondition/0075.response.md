Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without modifying any variables.
