To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and identify the relevant details:

1. **Variables and their descriptions:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
   - `n`: An integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive.
   - `a`: A list of integers parsed from `case`.
   - `num`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `num2`: An input integer.
   - `case`: The input string from which `a` is derived.
   - `op`: The original value of `b[ma]` + 1.
   - `b`: A sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by the number of iterations.
   - `median`: The original value of `b[ma]`.
   - `new_median`: `b[ma]` + 1.
   - `i`: Incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `ma`: Calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `int(num2 / 2)`.

2. **Understanding `op`:**
   - `op` is defined as the original value of `b[ma]` + 1.
   - `b[ma]` is the median of the list `b` (or the middle element if `num2` is odd, or the lower of the two middle elements if `num2` is even).

3. **Determining the printed value:**
   - Since `op` is the original value of `b[ma]` plus one, we need to know the value of `b[ma]` before it was incremented.
   - `b` is a sorted version of `a`, and `ma` is the index of the median element in `b`.

Given the above information, we can conclude that `op` is the median of the sorted list `b` plus one.

Output: **op (where op is the original median of the sorted list b plus one)**
