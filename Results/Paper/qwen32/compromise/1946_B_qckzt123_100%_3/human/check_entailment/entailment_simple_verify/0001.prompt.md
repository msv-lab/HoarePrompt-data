You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective**: We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, calculating its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   
2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the sum, we should focus on adding the largest possible positive sums repeatedly. If the array has any positive subarrays, the optimal strategy is to keep doubling the largest positive subarray sum and adding it to the total sum. If there are no positive subarrays, the best we can do is add zeros (by choosing empty subarrays).

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Calculate the total sum of the array.
   - Find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray using Kadane's algorithm.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is positive, repeatedly double it and add it to the total sum up to `k` times.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is zero or negative, the best we can do is add zeros, so the result is simply the total sum of the array.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `k` (number of operations).
   - It then reads the array `a`.

2. **Calculating Total Sum**:
   - The program calculates the total sum `s` of the array.

3. **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - The program uses a modified version of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray (`t`). This is done by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum `tmp`. If `tmp` becomes negative, it resets to zero. The maximum value of `tmp` during this process is stored in `t`.

4. **Calculating the Result**:
   - The initial result `ans` is set to `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - If `k > 1`, the program doubles `t` and adds it to `ans` for `k-1` times, taking care to apply the modulo operation at each step to prevent overflow.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases.

- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Array: `[-4, -7]`
  - Total sum `s = -11`
  - Maximum subarray sum `t = 0` (since all elements are negative)
  - Result: `(-11 + 0) % MOD = 999999996`

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Array: `[2, 2, 8]`
  - Total sum `s = 12`
  - Maximum subarray sum `t = 12`
  - After 3 operations: `ans = (12 + 12) % MOD + (12 * 2) % MOD + (12 * 4) % MOD = 96`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Array: `[7]`
  - Total sum `s = 7`
  - Maximum subarray sum `t = 7`
  - After 7 operations: `ans = (7 + 7) % MOD + (7 * 2) % MOD + ... = 896`

All test cases match the expected results, indicating that the program is likely correct.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and verification with example test cases, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.
