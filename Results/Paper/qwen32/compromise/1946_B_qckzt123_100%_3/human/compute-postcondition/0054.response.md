Output State: **`t` is `max(tmp + x, 0)`, `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `ans` is `((s + t_initial) % MOD + t_initial * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.** 

Explanation: The value of `tmp` is updated to `tmp + x`. Consequently, `t` is recalculated as `max(tmp + x, 0)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
