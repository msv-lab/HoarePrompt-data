The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `T`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop's continuation condition, the only variable we need to adjust is `T`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have decremented `T` by 1 if it were a typical countdown loop. However, since the loop is defined as `for _ in range(T):`, `T` itself does not change during the loop; instead, the loop iterates `T` times based on its initial value.

For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be decremented by 1 from its current value because the loop will terminate when `T` reaches 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`
- `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends
- `ans` is `((s + t * (2^k - 2)) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`

We only need to adjust `T` for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends, `ans` is `((s + t * (2^k - 2)) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`**
