Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is `tmp` + `x`, `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer, and `a` must have at least one element, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `tmp` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
