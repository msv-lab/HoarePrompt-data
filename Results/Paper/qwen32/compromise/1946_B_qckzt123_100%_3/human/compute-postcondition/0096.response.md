Postcondition: **`t` is `max(0, tmp)`, `tmp` is `0` if `tmp` was initially less than 0; otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged. `ans` is `((s + t * (2^k - 2)) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
