The code snippet sets `tmp` to 0. This affects only the variable `tmp`, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is `max(0, tmp + x)`, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is `((s + t * (2^k - 2)) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
