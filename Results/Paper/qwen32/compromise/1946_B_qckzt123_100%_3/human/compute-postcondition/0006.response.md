The code snippet provided assigns the value `0` to both `t` and `tmp`. This means that the initial values of `t` and `tmp` (which were `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `tmp` was not defined before) are now specifically set to `0`. All other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `MOD`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer read from the input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`.**
