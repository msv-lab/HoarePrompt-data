The given code snippet `tmp += x` increments the variable `tmp` by the value of `x`. However, `x` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. Therefore, the only thing we can say is that `tmp` is increased by the value of `x`.

Given that no other variables are affected and their values remain unchanged, the output state will reflect the updated value of `tmp` while keeping other variables as they were initially.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is `tmp + x`, `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `ans` is `((s + t_initial) % MOD + t_initial * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD`**
