Output State: **`t` is `((twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0) % MOD) * 2 % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends, `ans` is `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is `k - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is doubled and then taken modulo `MOD`. The values of `tmp`, `ans`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.
