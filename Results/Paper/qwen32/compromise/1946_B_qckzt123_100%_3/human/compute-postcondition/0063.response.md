To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the variables `t` and `tmp` evolve as the loop progresses over each element in the list `a`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is initialized to 0.
   - `tmp` is initialized to 0.
   
2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each element `x` in the list `a`, `tmp` is updated by adding `x` to it.
   - If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to 0.
   - `t` is updated to be the maximum value between `t` and `tmp`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After processing all elements in `a`, `tmp` will hold the cumulative sum of the elements up to the point where it was last non-negative.
   - `t` will hold the maximum cumulative sum encountered during the entire iteration process, ensuring that it never goes below 0.

The variable `ans` is calculated outside the loop based on the final values of `t` and `s` (sum of the list `a`). However, since the question asks for the state after the loop completes, we focus on `t` and `tmp`.

**Output State:**
- `t` will be the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0.
- `tmp` will be the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends.

Let's express this in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0, and `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends.**

In simpler terms, `t` is the highest sum of any contiguous subarray within `a` that does not include a negative sum, and `tmp` is the sum of the last such contiguous subarray encountered.
