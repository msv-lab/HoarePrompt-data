The code snippet `t *= 2` doubles the value of `t`. Given the initial state, `t` was already defined as `(2 * t) % MOD`. After executing `t *= 2`, the new value of `t` will be `((2 * t) % MOD) * 2`.

Output State: **`t` is `((2 * t) % MOD) * 2`; `tmp` is the final cumulative sum (or 0 if negative); `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`; `T` is `T - 1`; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input line; `s` is the sum of the list `a`; `i` is 3**.

In simpler terms, the value of `t` is now doubled based on its previous definition, while all other variables remain unchanged.
