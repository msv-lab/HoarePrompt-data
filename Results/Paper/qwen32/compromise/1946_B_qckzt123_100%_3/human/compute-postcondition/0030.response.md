The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust only `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < k - 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Here's the updated state:

State: **`t` is `(twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the list `a`) % 1000000007; `tmp` is 0 if the last contiguous subarray sum was negative; otherwise, it is the sum of the last contiguous subarray with a positive sum; `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `k` are integers such that `k` is at least 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`; `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t % MOD`; `i` is 1.`**
