The code snippet `ans += t` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `t`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `(twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0) % MOD`
- `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends
- `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`
- `k` must be greater than 1

After executing `ans += t`, the new value of `ans` becomes `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`. Simplifying this, we get `ans = ((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `(twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends, `ans` is `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `k` must be greater than 1**.
