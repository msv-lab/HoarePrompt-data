### Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to handle a specific range of `n` values (from 1 to 4) and print predefined checkerboard patterns for each of these values. However, the problem description specifies that `n` can be as large as 20. The program does not handle cases where `n` is greater than 4, instead, it outputs 'No esta en el rango' for such cases. 

Since the program does not correctly handle all possible values of `n` (specifically, it fails to generate the required pattern for `n` greater than 4), it does not meet the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
