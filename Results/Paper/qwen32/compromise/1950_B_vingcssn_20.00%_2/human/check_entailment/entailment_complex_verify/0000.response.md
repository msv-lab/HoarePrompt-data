Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program only handles specific cases for `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4) and explicitly prints predefined patterns for these values. The program does not generate the correct checkerboard pattern for any `n` outside this range, including `n = 5` up to `n = 20`. As a result, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case of `n` within the given range (1 to 20).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle all possible values of `n` as specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
