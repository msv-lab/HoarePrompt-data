Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program explicitly handles only the cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. It does not have a mechanism to generate the checkerboard pattern for any other value of `n` within the specified range (1 to 20). As a result, for `n` values greater than 4, the program outputs "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This means the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case within the input range, making it incorrect.

Final: **False**
