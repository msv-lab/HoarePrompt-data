### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to analyze the logic used in the function `func_1` to ensure it correctly computes the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` for each test case.
   - It also reads the list of `x` vertices Bessie has chosen and adjusts them to be 0-indexed for easier manipulation.

2. **Initial Triangular Pieces Calculation:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `x - 2`. This is because with `x` vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed without any additional vertices is `x - 2` (a well-known result in graph theory for triangulation of polygons).

3. **Checking for Immediate Triangles:**
   - The function then iterates over the chosen vertices and checks if adding a diagonal between `a[i]` and `a[i] + 2` (considering modulo `n`) can form a triangle. If `a[i] + 1` is not already a chosen vertex, this forms a new triangle, and `ans` is incremented.

4. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The function calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices. A gap is defined as the number of vertices between two chosen vertices minus one.
   - These gaps are stored in the list `gaps`.

5. **Maximizing Triangles with Additional Vertices:**
   - The gaps are sorted in ascending order.
   - The function then iterates over the sorted gaps and tries to fill them with additional vertices to form more triangles.
   - For each gap, the number of pairs of vertices that can be added is `gap // 2`. If `y` (the number of additional vertices allowed) is greater than or equal to this number, the gap can be completely filled, and the corresponding number of triangles is added to `ans`.
   - If `y` is less than the number of pairs needed to fill a gap, the function adds as many triangles as possible with the available vertices and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, the function prints the computed value of `ans`, which represents the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Correctness:

The logic used in the function appears to correctly compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by considering both the initial triangles formed by the chosen vertices and the additional triangles that can be formed by adding up to `y` more vertices.

The function handles edge cases such as:
- When no additional vertices are allowed (`y = 0`).
- When the chosen vertices are such that no additional triangles can be formed without additional vertices.
- When the gaps between chosen vertices are large enough to allow multiple pairs of additional vertices.

Thus, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

**Correctness: True**
