To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state. Here's the breakdown of the information given:

- `ans` is updated to the sum of all `gap` values for which `y` was sufficient plus `2 * y` for the last `gap` processed where `y < pairs`.
- `y` is reduced accordingly.

Given the description, `ans` is calculated based on the values of `gap` and `y` as per the conditions provided. However, the exact values of `gap`, `y`, and `pairs` are not explicitly provided. Therefore, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Sum of `gap` values for which `y` was sufficient**: This means that for certain `gap` values, the value of `y` was enough to process those `gap` values, and these `gap` values are summed up.
2. **`2 * y` for the last `gap` processed where `y < pairs`**: This indicates that for the last `gap` processed, the value of `y` was less than `pairs`, and `2 * y` is added to the sum.

Based on this, we can describe the value of `ans` as the sum of the `gap` values for which `y` was sufficient plus `2 * y` for the last `gap` processed where `y < pairs`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of all gap values for which y was sufficient plus 2 * y for the last gap processed where y < pairs)**
