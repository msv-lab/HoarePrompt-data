Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.', `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a string with at least one character, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `s` is 1 if `b[j]` is '@', `s` is 0 if `b[j]` is not '@', and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the most internal loop or if statement to be exited. The values of `t`, `n`, `path`, `a`, `d`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `s` remain as described in the initial state, except that the loop or if statement is terminated.
