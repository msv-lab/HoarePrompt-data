Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.', `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a string with at least one character, `i` is `i + 1`. If `b[j]` is '@', then `s` is 1. If `b[j]` is not '@', then `s` is 0. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `b[j + 1]` is also '*', the values of the variables do not change. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.**
