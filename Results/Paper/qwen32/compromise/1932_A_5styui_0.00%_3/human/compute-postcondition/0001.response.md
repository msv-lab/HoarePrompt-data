Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.'; `a` is an input integer; `s` is 0.**

Natural Language: The value of `s` has been set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `path`, and `a`) retain their initial values and constraints.
