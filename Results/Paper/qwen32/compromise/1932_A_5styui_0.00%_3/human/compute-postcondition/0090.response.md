Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.', `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is the index at which the loop breaks, `s` is 1 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0. The character at index `j` in `b` is either '@' or '*', and if `b[j]` is '*', the loop or if statement is terminated.**
