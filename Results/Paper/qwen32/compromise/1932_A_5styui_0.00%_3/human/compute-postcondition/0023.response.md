Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.'; `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input string that must have at least one character. If `b[j]` is equal to '@', then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `b` is non-empty or if `b[j + 1]` equals '*'. `j` is now `j + 1`. If `b[j + 1]` equals '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
