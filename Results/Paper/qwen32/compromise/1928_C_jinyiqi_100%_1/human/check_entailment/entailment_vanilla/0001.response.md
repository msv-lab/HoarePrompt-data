Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves finding the number of possible values of `k` such that in a sequence where positions are assigned in a repeating pattern, a given position `n` is assigned the number `x`. The pattern is:
- First `k` positions: 1, 2, ..., k
- Next `k-2` positions: k-1, k-2, ..., 2
- This pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.

### Key Observations

1. **Pattern Length**: The pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.
2. **Position Assignment**: For a given `k`, the position `n` can be mapped to a number `x` within the repeating pattern.
3. **Constraints**: `k > 1` and `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`.
   - These conditions are used to determine potential values of `k`.

3. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` finds all divisors of `x`.
   - The divisors are used to determine possible values of `k`.

4. **Generating Possible `k` Values**:
   - For each divisor `s` of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`, it checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, `(s + 2) / 2` is added to the list of possible `k` values.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the number of unique possible `k` values.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return divisors of `x`, but it returns them in a specific order that is not necessary for the problem.
   - The function should return divisors of `x`, but the order of divisors does not affect the correctness of the solution.

2. **Logic for Determining `k`**:
   - The program uses the conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` to determine potential values of `k`.
   - It then checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each divisor `s`.
   - These conditions are derived from the pattern and the problem constraints, but the implementation seems correct.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraint `k > 1` by ensuring `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct. The program correctly determines the number of possible values of `k` that fit the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
