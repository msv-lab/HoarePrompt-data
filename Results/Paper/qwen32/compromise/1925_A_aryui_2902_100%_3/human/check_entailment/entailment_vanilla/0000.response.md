Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Requirements
The goal is to construct a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in `s`. The constructed string `s` should have the smallest possible length.

### Provided Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **String Construction:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1()` that constructs the string `s`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then creates a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the alphabet and repeating this substring `n` times.

### Correctness Analysis

Let's consider the example test cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `n = 1`, `k = 2`
  - Expected Output: A string that contains all subsequences of length 1 using the first 2 alphabets (`a` and `b`). Possible outputs include `ab`, `ba`, etc.
  - Program Output: `ab` (which is correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `k = 1`
  - Expected Output: A string that contains all subsequences of length 2 using the first alphabet (`a`). The only possible output is `aa`.
  - Program Output: `aa` (which is correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
  - Expected Output: A string that contains all subsequences of length 2 using the first 2 alphabets (`a` and `b`). Possible outputs include `baab`, `abba`, etc.
  - Program Output: `aabb` (which is incorrect as it does not contain subsequences like `ba`)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `k = 3`
  - Expected Output: A string that contains all subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 alphabets (`a`, `b`, `c`). Possible outputs include `abcbac`, `abcabc`, etc.
  - Program Output: `aaabbb` (which is incorrect as it does not contain subsequences like `ba`, `bc`, `cb`, etc.)

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly construct the string `s` for `n > 1` and `k > 1` because it simply repeats the first `k` characters `n` times, which does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.

**Correctness: **False**
