Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It reads from standard input where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. Each subsequent line contains two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). For each test case, the function returns a string consisting of the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.**
