The code provided reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, `n` and `k`. Given that the initial state is the function `func_1` being called without arguments and the input being read from standard input, the values of `n` and `k` will be assigned based on the input provided.

Since the input format specifies that the first line contains a single integer `t` (the number of test cases) and each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `k`, the code snippet provided (`n, k = map(int, input().split())`) will read the next line of input (which should contain two integers) and assign these integers to `n` and `k`.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is called without any arguments. The input is read from standard input where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers from the current line of input.**
