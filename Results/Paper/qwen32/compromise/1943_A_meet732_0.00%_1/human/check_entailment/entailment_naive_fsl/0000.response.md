Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided code does not handle all edge cases and potential scenarios correctly as per the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the final score based on the MEX value is flawed in certain cases.

Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break
```

### Issues:

1. **Handling of `cntl[0]`**:
   - The code checks if `cntl[0]` is zero and prints `0` if true. This is correct because if `0` is not in the array, the MEX is `0`.

2. **Logic for `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is initialized to `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is intended to account for the number of `0`s in the array, but the subsequent logic is flawed.
   - The decrement of `c` is based on the count of elements less than `2`, which does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

3. **Loop for `j`**:
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `n` and checks if `cntl[j] < 2`. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't correctly simulate the game's rules where Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.
   - The decrement of `c` and the break condition do not correctly simulate the game's optimal strategy.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

The correct output should be `5` because the MEX of `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` is `5`. However, the provided code will output `1` because `cntl[1] < 2` and the loop breaks immediately.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly simulate the game, we need to consider the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

1. Count the occurrences of each number in the array.
2. Alice will always pick the smallest number that appears an odd number of times to maximize the MEX.
3. Bob will pick the smallest number that appears an even number of times to minimize the MEX.
4. The final MEX is the smallest number that does not appear in the array `c`.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if cntl[j] % 2 == 0:
                continue
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            print(n)

# This code correctly simulates the game and finds the MEX.
```

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly simulate the game's rules and does not handle all edge cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
