Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `c` is the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`. The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.**

In simpler terms, the value of `c` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
