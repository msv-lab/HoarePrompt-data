Postcondition: **`cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. The first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not equal to 0; `c` is either 0 or 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 1; the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2. Additionally, either `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
