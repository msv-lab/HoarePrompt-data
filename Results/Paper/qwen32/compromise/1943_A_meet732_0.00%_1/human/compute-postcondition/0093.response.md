Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **cntl**: This is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. The first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not equal to 0, meaning there is at least one occurrence of the number 0 in list `a`.

2. **c**: This variable is either 0 or 1.

3. **n**: This is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1.

4. **j**: This variable is initialized to 1.

5. **cntl[j]**: The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2. Since `j` is initially 1, this means `cntl[1]` is less than 2, implying that the number 1 appears either 0 or 1 time in the list `a`.

6. **Additional Condition**: Either `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`. This condition doesn't directly affect the value of `j` but provides additional context or constraints on the values of `c` and `j`.

Given these conditions, we need to determine the value of `j` that will be printed.

- Since `j` is initialized to 1 and the condition `cntl[j] < 2` holds true for `j = 1`, `j` remains 1 unless it is modified elsewhere in the code (which is not provided here).
- The additional condition (either `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`) does not change the value of `j` if `c` is 0, or if `j` is already equal to `n`.

Thus, based on the provided initial state and the absence of any other code that modifies `j`, the value of `j` remains 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **1**
