The code snippet provided reinitializes the `cntl` list to a new list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. This means all the previous values in `cntl` are discarded and replaced with zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0.**
