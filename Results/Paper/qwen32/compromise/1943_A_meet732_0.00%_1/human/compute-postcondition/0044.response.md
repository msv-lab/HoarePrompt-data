The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `cntl` by 1. Given that `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is initially 1 and all other elements are 0, the value at index `i` will now be 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
