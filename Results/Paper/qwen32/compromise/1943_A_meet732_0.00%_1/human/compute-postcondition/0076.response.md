The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variable `n` is not affected by this line of code, but it is given as a precondition that `n` is an input integer and represents the number of iterations, which must be at least 1.

Output State: **The input value for the number of iterations must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
