The code snippet `c -= 1` decrements the value of `c` by 1. Given that `c` is either 1 or 2 initially, after the decrement, `c` will be either 0 or 1. 

The values of `cntl`, `n`, `j`, and `cntl[j]` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. The first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not equal to 0; `c` is either 0 or 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 1; the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.**
