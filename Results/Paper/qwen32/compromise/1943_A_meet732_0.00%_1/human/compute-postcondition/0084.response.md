To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the given states after the first three iterations.

The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a` and increments the value at index `i` in the list `cntl` by 1. This means that `cntl[i]` will hold the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.

After the loop executes all iterations, `cntl[i]` will be equal to the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

Therefore, the final output state of `cntl` will be a list where each index `i` contains the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `cntl` will reflect the frequency of each integer in the list `a` up to the maximum integer `n`.
