To determine the output state, we need to consider the provided loop and its behavior. The loop iterates a number of times specified by the input, and in each iteration, it calls the function `func_1()`. However, the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code, which means we cannot determine its exact effect on the variables `n` and `a` without additional information.

Since the function `func_1()` is not defined and its effect on the variables `n` and `a` is unknown, we can only assume that the loop does not alter these variables if `func_1()` does not modify them. Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state unless `func_1()` changes `n` or `a`.

Assuming `func_1()` does not modify `n` or `a`, the output state will be:

Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.**
