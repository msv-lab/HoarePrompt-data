Problem description: In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a big road that will divide the village into left and right sides based on the preferences of the residents.

Program:
```python
def func_2():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

Since the provided function `func_2` does not contain the actual logic for processing the test cases, let's infer the precondition based on the description and the typical structure of such problems.

The function `func_2` calls `func_1` for each test case. Therefore, `func_1` is expected to handle the logic for each individual test case. Based on the problem description, `func_1` should take the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.

Thus, the function `func_1` should have the following signature and precondition:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    # Implementation details
```

**Precondition: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.**
