You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
import os
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: - The loop prints `'YES'` or `'NO'` followed by the constructed `ans` string for each of the `t` test cases.
    #- The variables `t`, `s`, and the state of the input remain unchanged.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it prints `'NO'` if `n` is 1, otherwise it prints `'YES'` followed by a constructed string of length `n` using uppercase letters from the alphabet. The string is formed such that it contains pairs of consecutive letters from 'A' onwards, and if `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when `n == 1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `n == 1`, there should be no suitable string because a single character cannot have a neighbor. Therefore, the program should print "NO" for `n == 1`. However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" only when `n == 1`, which is correct, but it does not handle other cases properly.

Additionally, the program does not handle all cases correctly for `n > 1`. The logic for constructing the string is flawed. For example, when `n` is odd, the program starts with "AAA" and then adds pairs of different characters. This does not ensure that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string.

Let's consider an example:
- For `n = 3`, the program will output "YES" followed by "AAABB". However, this string has only 2 special characters (at positions 2 and 3), not 3.

To correct the program, we need to ensure that the string has exactly `n` special characters. One possible way to achieve this is by constructing the string in a way that each special character is exactly one of its neighbors. For example, for `n = 3`, a valid string could be "ABAC".

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import string

def func():
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
            if n % 2 == 1:
                ans += s[x]
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the string has exactly `n` special characters for all valid values of `n`.
