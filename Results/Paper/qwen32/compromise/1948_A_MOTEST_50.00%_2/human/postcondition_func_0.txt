The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it prints `'NO'` if `n` is 1, otherwise it prints `'YES'` followed by a constructed string of length `n` using uppercase letters from the alphabet. The string is formed such that it contains pairs of consecutive letters from 'A' onwards, and if `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA'.
