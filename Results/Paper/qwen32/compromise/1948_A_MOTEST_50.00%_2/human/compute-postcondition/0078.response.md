The code snippet `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Given that `x` was initially 1, after the increment, `x` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` must be at least 4 (so that `n // 2` is at least 2, allowing `j` to be incremented to 2); `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice; `x` is 2; `j` is 2**.
