The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `i`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the `print` statement**: The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
2. **Determine the content to be printed**: The content to be printed is the string `'NO'`.
3. **Check for dependencies on variables**: The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, the output is straightforward and does not change based on the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Output: **NO**
