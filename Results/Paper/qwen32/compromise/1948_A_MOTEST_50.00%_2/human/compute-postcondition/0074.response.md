The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends twice the character at index `x` of the string `s` to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `x` is 0, so it appends twice the first character of `s` to `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` must be at least 2; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice; `x` is 0.**
