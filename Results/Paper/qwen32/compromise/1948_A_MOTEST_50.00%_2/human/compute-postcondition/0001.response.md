The code snippet `s = string.ascii_uppercase` assigns the string `s` to the value of `string.ascii_uppercase`, which is the string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `s` is the string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`.**
