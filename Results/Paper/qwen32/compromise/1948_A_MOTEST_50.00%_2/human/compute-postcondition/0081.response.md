The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Initially, `x` is 2, so after the increment, `x` becomes 3. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` must be at least 8; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice and then the third character of `s` repeated twice; `x` is 3; `j` is 3.**
