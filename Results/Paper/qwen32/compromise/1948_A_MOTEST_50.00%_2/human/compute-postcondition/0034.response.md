Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq t \leq 50 \).
2. `n` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 1.
3. `x` is calculated as `n // 2`.
4. If `n` is even, `ans` is a string formed by repeating each character in the first half of a string `s` twice.
5. If `n` is odd, `ans` is a string starting with `'AAA'` followed by repeating each character in the second part of the first half of `s` twice.
6. If `n` is odd, `j` is calculated as `n // 2 - 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet provided contains only one `print` statement: `print('YES')`. This statement is independent of the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `ans`, and `j` described in the initial state. The `print` statement will directly output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `ans`, or `j`, it will simply output the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
