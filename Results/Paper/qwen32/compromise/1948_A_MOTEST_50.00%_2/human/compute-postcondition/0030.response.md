The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends `s[x] * 2` to the existing value of `ans`. Given that `x` is 3, this means `s[3] * 2` is appended to `ans`.

Initial State: 
- `t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50)
- `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is odd, `n` must be at least 5
- `ans` is `'AAA' + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2`
- `x` is 3
- `j` is 2

After executing `ans += s[x] * 2`, the new value of `ans` will be `'AAA' + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2 + s[3] * 2`.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is odd, `n` must be at least 5; `ans` is `'AAA' + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2 + s[3] * 2`; `x` is 3; `j` is 2**.
