Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the percentage of residents satisfied on each side of the road. Specifically, the program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using a 100 denominator, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the ceiling of the ratio of satisfied residents to the total number of residents on each side, not the percentage.

For example, consider the input:

```
3
101
```

The program incorrectly calculates the percentages and fails to identify the correct position for the road. The correct approach should be to directly compare the counts of zeros and ones on each side without converting them into percentages.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        sl = list(s)
        zero = sl.count('0')
        one = sl.count('1')
        (zero_count, one_count) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero_count += 1
            else:
                one_count += 1
            
            if zero_count >= math.ceil(zero / 2) and one_count >= math.ceil(one / 2):
                lst.append(i + 1)
        
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(n // 2 - ele))
        
        final = [ele for ele in lst if abs(n // 2 - ele) == mini]
        final.sort()
        if len(final) == 0:
            if zero >= math.ceil(n / 2):
                final.append(0)
            else:
                final.append(n)
        
        print(final[0])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies the position for the road based on the given conditions.
