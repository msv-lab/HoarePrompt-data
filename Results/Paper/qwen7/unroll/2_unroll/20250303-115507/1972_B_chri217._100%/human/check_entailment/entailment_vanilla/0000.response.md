### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input.
   - It then iterates `t` times to read the number of coins `n` and the string `s` for each test case.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in a list called `cases`.
   - The function correctly handles the reading of input and storing it in a structured format.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a single test case as an argument.
   - It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` using a generator expression within the `sum` function.
   - It returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' is odd, otherwise it returns 'NO'.
   - This logic aligns with the problem statement where the player with an odd number of facing-up coins wins.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The main program calls `func_1` to get all test cases.
   - It then calls `func_2` for each test case and prints the result.
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct and matches the problem's requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2, as specified in the problem statement.
   - The program correctly outputs "YES" or "NO" based on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
