### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input.
   - It then iterates `t` times to read the number of coins `n` and the string `s` for each test case.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in a list called `cases`.
   - The function correctly handles the reading of input and storing it in a structured format.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a single test case as an argument.
   - It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` using a generator expression within the `sum` function.
   - It returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' is odd, otherwise it returns 'NO'.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed because it does not account for the actual game mechanics. The function simply checks if the number of 'U' characters is odd, which does not reflect the game's rules accurately.

3. **Game Mechanics**:
   - In the game, the player must choose a facing-up coin and remove it, flipping the two adjacent coins.
   - The game continues until no more facing-up coins remain.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The function `func_2` does not simulate these moves; it only checks the initial count of 'U' characters.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the first test case: `5 UUDUD`.
     - Initially, there are 3 facing-up coins ('U').
     - Alice can choose the first coin, making the string "DDUU".
     - Bob can then choose the last coin, making the string "UDD".
     - Alice can choose the first coin again, making the string "UU".
     - Bob can choose the first coin, making the string "U".
     - Alice can choose the only remaining coin, and the game ends.
     - Despite starting with an odd number of 'U', Alice wins because she makes the last move.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly simulate the game mechanics and thus does not determine the winner based on the actual game rules.
   - The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program is correct because it did not account for the game's dynamic nature.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game's rules accurately and instead only checks the initial count of 'U' characters.
