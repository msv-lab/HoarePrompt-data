### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days, where each day's ticket price can increase based on the number of tickets purchased on that day.

2. **Key Points in the Given Solution**:
   - The solution sorts the list of ticket prices (`l`) in ascending order.
   - It iterates through the sorted list and calculates the cost of buying up to `m` tickets each day.
   - For each day, it buys the maximum possible tickets (`min(m, k)`), updates the remaining tickets to buy (`k -= s`), and adds the cost to the total cost (`c`).

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - Sorting the list of prices is unnecessary because the algorithm always buys the cheapest tickets first, which is inherently handled by iterating through the list.
   - The calculation of `c` as `k * k / 2` is incorrect. This formula does not reflect the actual cost calculation based on the problem statement.
   - The cost calculation should be `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, but this formula is also incorrect. The correct formula should be `c += l[i] * s`.

4. **Correct Cost Calculation**:
   - The correct approach is to buy the cheapest tickets first and calculate the cost accordingly.
   - For each day, buy `min(m, k)` tickets and update the remaining tickets to buy and the total cost.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The provided examples show that the solution does not correctly calculate the minimum cost. For instance, in the second test case, the solution incorrectly calculates the cost as 64 instead of 16.

### Conclusion:
The given solution has logical errors in the cost calculation and does not correctly implement the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
