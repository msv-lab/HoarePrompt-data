Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The program uses a formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to calculate the cost, which does not accurately reflect the problem's requirement. This formula seems to be an attempt to account for the increased prices after purchasing tickets, but it is not correctly implemented.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Ticket Purchases**: The program sets `s = min(m, k)` and then subtracts `s` from `k`, but this does not properly handle the scenario where the number of tickets available on a day might be less than `m`. It also does not correctly update the prices for subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased on the current day.
3. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list of ticket prices before processing, which is unnecessary and does not align with the problem's requirements. The prices should be processed in the order they are given.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
- `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`
- `a = [8, 6, 4, 2]`

**Expected Output**: The minimum cost to buy 3 tickets is 10, as explained in the problem description.

However, the program outputs a different value. For instance, if we run the program with the above input, it will not correctly calculate the minimum cost due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, and thus, it is incorrect.
