Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`. This means that `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Initially, `i` is 0 because the loop starts with `i = 0` (the default starting point for `range()`).

4. **Determine the state of `int(input())`**: The value of `int(input())` is determined by the user input, but we know it must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `int(input())` to ensure the loop can execute.

- `i` should be 0 initially.
- `int(input())` should be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**
