### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days, where each day's ticket price can increase based on the number of tickets purchased on that day.

2. **Key Points in the Given Solution**:
   - The solution sorts the list of ticket prices (`l`) in ascending order.
   - It iterates through the sorted list and calculates the cost of buying up to `m` tickets each day.
   - For each day, it buys the maximum possible tickets (`min(m, k)`), updates the remaining tickets to buy (`k -= s`), and adds the cost to the total cost (`c`).

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - Sorting the list of prices is unnecessary because the algorithm always buys the cheapest tickets first, which is inherently handled by iterating through the list.
   - The calculation of `c` as `k * k / 2` is incorrect. This formula does not reflect the actual cost calculation based on the problem statement.
   - The cost calculation should be `c += l[i] * s`, where `s = min(m, k)` and `k -= s` for each iteration of the inner loop.

4. **Correct Cost Calculation**:
   - The correct approach is to buy the cheapest tickets first and calculate the cost accordingly.
   - For each day, buy `min(m, k)` tickets and update the remaining tickets to buy and the total cost.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - Let's analyze the provided test cases:
     - **First Test Case**: The solution should buy 0 tickets on the first two days, 1 ticket on the third day, and 2 tickets on the fourth day. The total cost should be 10.
     - **Second Test Case**: The solution should buy 2 tickets on each of the four days. The total cost should be 64.
     - **Third Test Case**: The solution should buy 1 ticket on the first day. The total cost should be 1.
     - **Fourth Test Case**: The solution should buy 3 tickets on the first day, 3 tickets on the second day, and 3 tickets on the third day. The total cost should be 72.

6. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The given solution does not correctly calculate the minimum cost. The formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `c += l[i] * s`.
   - The solution should iterate through the list of prices, buy the maximum possible tickets each day, and update the remaining tickets to buy and the total cost.

### Conclusion:
The given solution has logical errors in the cost calculation and does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The provided test cases show that the solution does not produce the correct results.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
