Output State: `password` is a string consisting of characters that are either in non-decreasing order (digits first followed by letters) or all characters are the same. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string sorted in ascending order. `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string sorted in alphabetical order. If the loop returns `False`, it means the `password` does not meet the criteria of having digits and letters in non-decreasing order with digits coming before letters, or all characters being the same.
