Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly separates the digits and letters from the input password.
2. It then sorts the digits and letters separately.
3. The function checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order and if the last digit is not greater than the first letter (if any letters exist).
4. Finally, it constructs a new password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters and compares it with the original password to ensure the order is correct.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the annotated program, the function `func_1` correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
