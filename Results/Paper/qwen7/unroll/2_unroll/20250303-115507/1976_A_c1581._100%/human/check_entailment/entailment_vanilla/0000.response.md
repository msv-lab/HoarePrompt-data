Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
2. For each password, it separates the characters into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
3. It sorts both lists separately.
4. It checks if any digit is greater than the next digit (to ensure digits are in non-decreasing order).
5. It also checks if any letter comes before a digit (to ensure letters are followed only by more letters or the end of the string).
6. After sorting the digits and letters separately, it concatenates them and compares the result with the original password to ensure the order is maintained as required.
7. The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and should work as intended according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
