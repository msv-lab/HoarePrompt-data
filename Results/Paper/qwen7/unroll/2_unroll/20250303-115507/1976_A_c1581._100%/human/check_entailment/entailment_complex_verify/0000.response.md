### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. Password must consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It then sorts these lists.
   - It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - It also checks if the last digit is greater than any of the letters, which is incorrect as per the problem statement.

2. **Sorting and Validation**:
   - After sorting, the function joins the `digits` and `letters` lists to form `sortedPassword`.
   - It then compares `sortedPassword` with the original password.
   - If they match, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Check for Digits Order**:
   - The function checks if the last digit is greater than any of the letters, which is not sufficient to ensure all digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - For example, in the test case `b123a456`, the function incorrectly returns `True` because `6` (the last digit) is not greater than any letter, even though `123` and `456` are not in non-decreasing order.

2. **No Direct Check for Non-Decreasing Order of Digits**:
   - The function does not explicitly check if all digits are in non-decreasing order relative to each other.

#### Correctness of the Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function does not ensure all digits are in non-decreasing order. The test case `b123a456` demonstrates this issue clearly.

#### Revised Function to Ensure Correctness:
To fix the issue, we need to add a check to ensure all digits are in non-decreasing order before performing the final comparison.

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    
    # Check if all digits are in non-decreasing order
    for i in range(len(digits) - 1):
        if digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
    
    # Check if there is any digit that comes after a letter
    for i in range(len(letters)):
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    return sortedPassword == password
```

With this revised function, the program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis and the corrected function, the original assessment was accurate.

**Final: False**
