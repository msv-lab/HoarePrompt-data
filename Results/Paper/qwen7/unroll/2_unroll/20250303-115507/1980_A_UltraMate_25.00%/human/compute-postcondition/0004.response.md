Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5), and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, it returns information based on the values of n, m, and the string a.**
