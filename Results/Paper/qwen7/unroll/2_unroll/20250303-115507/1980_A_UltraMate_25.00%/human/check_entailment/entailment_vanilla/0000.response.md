### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can conduct `m` rounds, each requiring at least one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. 

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of existing problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It then reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.

3. **Counting Existing Problems**:
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

4. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the difficulty levels 'A' to 'F' (since 'G' is not considered in the initial check).
     - If a difficulty level is missing (`i not in hmp`), it adds `m` to `ans` because Vlad needs to create `m` problems of that difficulty.
     - If the count of a difficulty level in `hmp` is less than `m`, it calculates the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) and adds this to `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of additional problems needed.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases appropriately, such as when there are no missing difficulty levels or when some levels have fewer problems than required.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The logic implemented in the program accurately calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed based on the given constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
