Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
3. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
4. It uses a string `p = 'ABCDEF'` to represent the required difficulty levels for the rounds, excluding 'G' since it's not included in `p`.
5. It creates a counter `hmp` to count the occurrences of each character in `s`.
6. It iterates over each character in `p`:
   - If a character is not in `hmp`, it means no problems of that difficulty exist, so it adds `m` to `ans` (since at least `m` problems of this difficulty are needed).
   - If a character is in `hmp` but its count is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans`.
7. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

This logic ensures that the program calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure there are at least `m` problems of each required difficulty level.

Given the provided example and the logic of the program, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
