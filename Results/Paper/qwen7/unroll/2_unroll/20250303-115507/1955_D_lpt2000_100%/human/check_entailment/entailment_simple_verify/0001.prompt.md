You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for the number of test cases (`nabors`), the dimensions of the arrays (`n`, `m`, `k`), and the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counter Initialization**: It initializes counters for the first `m` elements of `a` (`cnt_aa`) and all elements of `b` (`cnt_bb`).

3. **Intersection Calculation**: It calculates the intersection of these two counters (`D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb`), which gives the common elements between the first `m` elements of `a` and all elements of `b`.

4. **Initial Matching Count**: It counts the initial number of matching elements (`pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())`).

5. **Sliding Window Logic**: 
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - For each new element entering the window and the element leaving the window, it updates the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` accordingly.
   - It checks if the updated number of matching elements (`pairs_in_D`) meets the requirement (`k`).

6. **Count Good Subsegments**: It increments the count of good subsegments (`fnd`) whenever the number of matching elements is at least `k`.

7. **Output**: Finally, it prints the count of good subsegments for each test case.

### Verification:
- The logic for updating the counters and checking the conditions is correct.
- The sliding window approach ensures that each subsegment of length `m` is evaluated.
- The conditions for determining if a subsegment is good are correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
