t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
