### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to place icons on screens where each screen is a 5x3 grid.
   - Icons can be either 1x1 or 2x2.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of screens used.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code starts by calling `func_1()`, which is defined later.
   - `func_1()` takes input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - The logic inside the function is designed to calculate the minimum number of screens needed.

3. **Breaking Down the Logic:**
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the number of full 2x2 icons that can fit into the remaining space after placing all 1x1 icons.
     - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` adjusts the remaining 1x1 icons after accounting for the space taken by 2x2 icons.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)` calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - The total number of screens is `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
   - If only `y` is greater than 0:
     - The number of screens needed is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - If only `x` is greater than 0:
     - The number of screens needed is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
     - No screens are needed, so the result is 0.

4. **Testing the Logic:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement matches the logic implemented in the code.
   - For instance, for the test case `(1, 1)`, the code correctly calculates that one screen is needed.
   - Similarly, for the test case `(7, 2)`, the code correctly calculates that one screen is needed.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases like when `x` or `y` is zero correctly.
   - It also correctly calculates the number of screens needed for mixed cases.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness:** **True**
