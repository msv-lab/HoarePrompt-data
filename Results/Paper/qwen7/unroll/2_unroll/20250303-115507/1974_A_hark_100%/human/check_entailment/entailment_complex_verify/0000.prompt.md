You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed during each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, the value printed depends on the inputs `x` and `y` provided by the `input().split()` function. If both `x` and `y` are positive, the output is calculated based on the formulas involving ceiling functions and arithmetic operations with `x` and `y`. If only one of them is positive, the output is either the ceiling of `y/2` or `x/15`, depending on which variable is positive. If both are zero, the output is 0. The exact sequence of outputs will depend on the specific values of `x` and `y` entered during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases (up to 10,000). For each test case, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(y\) (both between 0 and 99). Based on the values of \(x\) and \(y\), it calculates and prints one of the following:
- The sum of \(\left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil\) and \(\left\lceil \frac{x - \left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil \times 15 + y \times 4}{15} \right\rceil\) if both \(x\) and \(y\) are positive.
- \(\left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil\) if only \(y\) is positive.
- \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{15} \right\rceil\) if only \(x\) is positive.
- 0 if both \(x\) and \(y\) are zero.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Let's analyze the logic:

1. For the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, the program attempts to calculate the number of screens needed but uses incorrect formulas:
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a single screen, which is correct.
   - However, the calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It subtracts the space taken by 2x2 icons from `x` and adds the space taken by 1x1 icons, which does not make sense in the context of the problem.
   - The subsequent calculation `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)` is also incorrect because it assumes that the remaining space can only be filled by 1x1 icons, which is not always true.

2. For the cases where either `x` or `y` is 0, the program handles them correctly by calculating the number of screens needed for the non-zero value.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected output: `1` (since we can place one 1x1 icon and one 2x2 icon on a single screen)
- Program output: Incorrect due to the flawed logic in the main calculation.

A correct approach would involve:
- Calculating the number of full 2x2 icons that can fit on a screen (`math.ceil(y / 2)`).
- Calculating the remaining space after placing these 2x2 icons.
- Using the remaining space to place 1x1 icons, ensuring that the total number of icons fits within the constraints of the grid.

Since the program does not handle the placement logic correctly, it fails to provide the correct output for at least one case, making it incorrect.
