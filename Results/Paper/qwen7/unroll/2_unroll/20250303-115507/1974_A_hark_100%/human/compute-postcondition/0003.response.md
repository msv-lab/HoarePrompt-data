Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed during each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, the value printed depends on the inputs `x` and `y` provided by the `input().split()` function. If both `x` and `y` are positive, the output is calculated based on the formulas involving ceiling functions and arithmetic operations with `x` and `y`. If only one of them is positive, the output is either the ceiling of `y/2` or `x/15`, depending on which variable is positive. If both are zero, the output is 0. The exact sequence of outputs will depend on the specific values of `x` and `y` entered during each iteration.
