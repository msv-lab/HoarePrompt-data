Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`num`) and then processing each test case individually.
2. **Array Length Check**: The program checks if the array length (`num2`) exceeds 10000. If it does, it prints 1 and 16668 immediately, which is not aligned with the problem statement. The problem statement requires processing each test case fully before printing the result.
3. **Sorting and Median Calculation**: The program sorts the array and calculates the median correctly. It handles both even and odd lengths of the array appropriately.
4. **Incrementing Elements**: The program increments elements starting from the middle index (or indices for even lengths) until the median is exceeded. This part of the logic is correct.
5. **Operation Counting**: The program counts the number of operations required to exceed the current median and prints the result for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue with the program's logic regarding the handling of large arrays. The program should not prematurely terminate when the array length exceeds 10000. Instead, it should process the entire array as specified in the problem statement.

Given these points, the program is almost correct but fails to handle the case where the array length exceeds 10000 properly. Therefore, the program needs to be corrected to ensure it processes all test cases fully.

Correctness: **False**
