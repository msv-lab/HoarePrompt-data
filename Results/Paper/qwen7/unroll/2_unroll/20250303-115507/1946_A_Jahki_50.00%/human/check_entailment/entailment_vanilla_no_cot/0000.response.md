Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`num`) and then processes each test case. However, it incorrectly handles the input for each test case. Specifically, it reads `num2` (the size of the array), but then it reads the entire line as a single string `case`, which is not split into individual elements. This will cause issues when trying to convert the string into a list of integers.

2. **Median Calculation**: The logic for calculating the median is flawed. For even-sized arrays, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, but the code only considers the lower middle number. Additionally, the loop to increment elements until the median increases is unnecessary and incorrect because it doesn't actually perform the minimal number of operations to achieve the goal.

3. **Break Statement**: The `break` statement inside the loop is used incorrectly. It breaks out of the loop prematurely if `num2` exceeds 10000, which is not part of the problem constraints.

### Corrected Program:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input().split()
        a = [int(x) for x in case]
        b = sorted(a)
        n = len(b)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            median_index = n // 2
            median = (b[median_index - 1] + b[median_index]) / 2
        else:
            median_index = n // 2
            median = b[median_index]
        
        # Find the minimum number of operations to make the median strictly greater than the current median
        if median.is_integer():
            target = int(median) + 1
        else:
            target = int(median) + 1
        
        operations = 0
        for j in range(n):
            if b[j] < target:
                operations += target - b[j]
        
        print(operations)

func()
```

This corrected program properly handles the input, calculates the median correctly, and determines the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.
