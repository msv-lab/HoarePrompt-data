Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (representing the number of test cases), an integer `n` (representing the length of the array `a`), and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. The function returns the results of processing each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a number of test cases (`t`), the length of an array (`n`), and the array itself (`a`). The function processes each test case according to the given specifications and returns the results accordingly.
