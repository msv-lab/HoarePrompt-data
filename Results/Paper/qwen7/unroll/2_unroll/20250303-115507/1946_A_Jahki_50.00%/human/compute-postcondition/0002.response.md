Output State: **num is an input integer, t remains unchanged, each test case has executed the loop and printed the operation count needed to increase the median of a sorted list until it exceeds the median, or printed 1 and 16668 if num2 is greater than 10000.**

This means that for each test case, the code processes the input `num2` and the list `case`, calculates the median, and then increments elements in the sorted list until the new median exceeds the original median (or exits if `num2` is greater than 10000). The number of operations required for each test case is printed, and this process repeats for all test cases.
