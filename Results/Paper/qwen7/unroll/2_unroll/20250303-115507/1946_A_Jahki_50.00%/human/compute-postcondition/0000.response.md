Output State: **`num` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case will involve reading an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, but these details are not provided yet and thus remain part of the precondition.
