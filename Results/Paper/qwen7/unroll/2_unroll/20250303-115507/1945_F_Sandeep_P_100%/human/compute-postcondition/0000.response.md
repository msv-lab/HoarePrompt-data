Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of n positive integers representing the magic powers of the mushrooms, and p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. A decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call has been defined but no variables have been changed by this code.**

The given code defines a decorator but does not alter the values of the existing variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
