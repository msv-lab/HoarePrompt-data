Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case it reads two positive integers \(x\) and \(n\). It then calculates the maximum value between all divisors \(i\) of \(x\) and their corresponding complementary divisors \(x // i\), but only considering those divisors that are less than or equal to \(n\). Finally, it prints the maximum value found for each test case.**
