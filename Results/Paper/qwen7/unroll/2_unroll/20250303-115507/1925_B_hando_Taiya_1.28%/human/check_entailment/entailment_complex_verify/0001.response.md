### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties is `x` and the GCD of these difficulties is maximized.
   - The program should handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of `x` and `n`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `x` is divisible by `n`, the optimal solution would be to have each sub-problem with difficulty `x // n`.
   - Otherwise, we need to find pairs `(i, x // i)` such that `i` divides `x` and `i <= n` or `x // i <= n`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
   - It then iterates through possible values from `1` to `isqrt(x)` to check if `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - If `i` is a divisor of `x` and `n <= x // i`, it updates `ans` with the maximum value of `i`.
     - If `x // i` is a divisor of `x` and `n <= i`, it updates `ans` with the maximum value of `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum balance found.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `x` is divisible by `n` by checking both `i` and `x // i`.
   - The use of `isqrt(x)` ensures that the loop runs efficiently.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` is sound and covers all necessary conditions to maximize the balance.
   - However, the program has a flaw in its approach. The current logic only checks if `i` or `x // i` is less than or equal to `n`. This may not always yield the maximum balance. For example, consider the test case `x = 10` and `n = 3`. The correct solution would be to split the problem into difficulties `[4, 3, 3]`, which gives a balance of `1`. But the program only considers `i` or `x // i` directly, missing this optimal split.

6. **Detailed Example:**
   - For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the program would consider `i = 1, 2, 3, 5, 10` and update `ans` with `max(1, 2, 3, 5, 10)`, which is `10`. This is incorrect because the optimal solution is `[4, 3, 3]` with a balance of `1`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not guarantee finding the maximum balance in all cases. The logic needs to consider all possible ways to split `x` into `n` parts and compute the GCD for each split.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
