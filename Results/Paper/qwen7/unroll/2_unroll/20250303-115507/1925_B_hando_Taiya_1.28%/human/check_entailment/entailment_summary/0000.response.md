Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program reads two integers \(x\) and \(n\).
3. The program aims to find the maximum balance, which is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.
4. To achieve this, the program iterates through all divisors \(i\) of \(x\) up to \(\sqrt{x}\).
5. For each divisor \(i\), it checks if \(i\) or its complementary divisor \(x // i\) can be used as a potential difficulty for the sub-problems.
6. It ensures that the number of sub-problems \(n\) does not exceed either the divisor or its complement.
7. The program updates the maximum balance found so far and prints it at the end of each test case.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It considers all necessary conditions and constraints, and the approach to finding the maximum balance is sound.

Correctness: **True**
