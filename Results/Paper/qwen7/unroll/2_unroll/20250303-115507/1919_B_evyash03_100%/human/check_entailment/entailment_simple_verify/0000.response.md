### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Statement Analysis**:
   - The goal is to split the array \(a\) (represented by the string `expression`) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The provided solution only counts the number of '+' characters and calculates the difference between the number of '-' and '+' characters. This does not account for the optimal way to split the array.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression` and then calculates the difference between the length of `expression` and this count.
   - It returns the absolute value of this difference.
   - This approach does not ensure the minimum penalty because it does not consider how to optimally split the array to minimize the penalty.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input `expression = "--++--"` with `length = 6`.
     - The program would count 2 '+' characters, so `count = 2`.
     - `sub = length - count = 6 - 2 = 4`.
     - The returned value is `abs(sub - count) = abs(4 - 2) = 2`.
   - However, the optimal split is `([--++], [--])`, which results in a penalty of `4 + 2 = 6`.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code confirms that `count` is the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.
   - `sub` is the difference between the length of `expression` and the number of '+' characters.
   - The returned value is the absolute difference between `sub` and `count`, which does not reflect the optimal penalty calculation.

Given these observations, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as it does not consider the optimal way to split the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
