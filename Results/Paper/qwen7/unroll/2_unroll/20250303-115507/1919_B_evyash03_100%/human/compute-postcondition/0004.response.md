Output State: **`length` is the length of the `expression`, `count` is the number of '+' characters in the `expression`, `sub` is the difference between `length` and `count`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the length of the `expression` and the number of '+' characters in it. This difference is stored in the variable `sub`. The other variables (`length` and `count`) retain their original values.
