Output State: The total cost calculated for each test case based on the given conditions. For each test case, if the modified price \(b\) is less than or equal to the usual price \(a\), the total cost is \(n \times a\). Otherwise, the total cost is \(k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a\), where \(k = \min(n, b - a)\).

This means for each test case, the output will be the total cost of buying \(n\) buns under the specified pricing conditions.
