Output State: The total cost calculated for each test case based on the given conditions. For each test case, if the price of the first bun (b) is greater than or equal to the usual price (a), the total cost is the sum of the first bun's discounted price multiplied by the minimum number of buns sold at the discounted price plus the usual price of the remaining buns. If the first bun's price is less than or equal to the usual price, the total cost is simply the usual price multiplied by the total number of buns.
