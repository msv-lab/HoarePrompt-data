Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes three positive integers: n (number of buns), a (usual price of a bun), and b (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). For each test case, it calculates and returns the total revenue generated from selling all buns.**

This means the function will take a series of test cases as input, each containing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the modified price for the first bun. It then calculates the total revenue based on these inputs and returns the result for each test case.
