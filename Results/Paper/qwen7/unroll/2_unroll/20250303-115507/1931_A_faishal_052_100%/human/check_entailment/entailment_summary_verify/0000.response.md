### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare its behavior with the expected output based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded value.

2. **Processing Logic**:
   - The program attempts to break down the integer `lex` into three parts, each part representing a letter in the word.
   - It uses a series of conditional statements to determine the values of these parts:
     - If `lex < 28`, it sets the first part to 1 and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex < 52`, it sets the second part to 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex <= 78`, it sets the third part to 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After setting the parts, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to the list.
   - It then sorts the list and stores it in the `info` list.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - For each test case, it constructs a string by converting the first two elements of the stored list to their corresponding lowercase letters and prints this string.

#### Issues Identified in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Value**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the remaining value after setting the first two parts. It should ensure that the remaining value is the smallest possible value that can form a valid three-letter word.
   - For example, for `n = 55`, the program outputs `"azz"` instead of `"czz"`. This is because the logic for determining the smallest possible characters is flawed.

2. **Sorting and Appending**:
   - The program sorts the list and appends the remaining value, which might not always result in the lexicographically smallest word.

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that we always select the smallest possible characters first. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Determine the first character
        if lex < 3:
            char1 = 1
            lex -= 1
        elif lex < 27:
            char1 = 1
            lex -= 26
        else:
            char1 = 26
            lex -= 26
        
        # Determine the second character
        if lex < 27:
            char2 = 1
            lex -= 1
        else:
            char2 = 26
            lex -= 26
        
        # Determine the third character
        char3 = lex
        
        # Convert characters to letters
        word = chr(char1 + 96) + chr(char2 + 96) + chr(char3 + 96)
        print(word)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis and the corrected approach, the original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle all cases and fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs.

**Final: False**
