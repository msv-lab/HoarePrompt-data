Output State: **`cases` is an input integer and 1 <= t <= 100; `info` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `info`. The values of `cases` and the range for `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `cases` is still an input integer with the condition 1 <= t <= 100, and `info` is an empty list.
