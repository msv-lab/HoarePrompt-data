You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: Output State: `info` is a list containing 100 lists. Each inner list contains 3 elements: two numbers between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and one number between 0 and 78 (inclusive). The last element of each inner list is derived from the initial value of `lex` after applying the specified operations, and the first two elements are the result of the operations on `lex`. All values are sorted within each inner list.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: For each inner list in `info`, the output will be a string created by converting the first three integers to their corresponding lowercase letters (using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`), concatenated together, and then printed. The fourth integer remains unchanged and is not part of the printed output.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing test cases (t) where each test case involves an integer n. For each test case, if 1 <= t <= 100 and 3 <= n <= 78, it processes these values, though the specific processing and return values are not detailed here.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
