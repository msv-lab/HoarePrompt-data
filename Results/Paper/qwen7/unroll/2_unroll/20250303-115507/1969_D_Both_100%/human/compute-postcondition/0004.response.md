Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers \( n \) and \( k \), and two lists of integers, `prices` and `bonuses`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum profit achievable by combining elements from both lists under specific conditions. It then prints the maximum profit for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
