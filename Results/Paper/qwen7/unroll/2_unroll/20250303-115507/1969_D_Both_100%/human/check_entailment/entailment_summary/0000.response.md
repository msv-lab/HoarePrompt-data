Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly reads the number of test cases, \( t \), and returns it. This is necessary to know how many test cases need to be processed.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly reads and splits the input into a sequence of integers. This is used to read \( n \), \( k \), `prices`, and `bonuses`.
3. **Function `func_3`**: This function calculates the total profit by considering the items in `primary_items` and the differences stored in `secondary_heap`. It correctly sums up the values based on the condition \( a_i + b_i \geq 0 \).
4. **Function `func_4`**: This function processes each test case as follows:
   - It initializes a min-heap (`heap`) and a list (`remaining_items`) to store items.
   - It reads \( n \), \( k \), `prices`, and `bonuses`.
   - It converts `prices` to negative values and creates a combined list of tuples `(neg_price, bonus)`.
   - It sorts the combined list by `bonus` to prioritize items with higher potential profit.
   - It pushes the top \( k \) items with the highest `bonus` into the heap.
   - It calculates the initial profit using `func_3` and updates the maximum profit if the current profit is higher.
   - It iterates through the remaining items, adjusting the profit based on whether the item should be added to the heap or not.
   - It ensures that the profit is maximized by considering the optimal combination of items in the heap and the remaining items.

Given the detailed breakdown and the logical steps in `func_4`, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize Alice's profit under the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
