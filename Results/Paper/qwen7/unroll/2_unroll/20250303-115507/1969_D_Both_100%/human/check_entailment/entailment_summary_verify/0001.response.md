### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing:**
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are defined correctly to handle input parsing.
     - `func_1` reads an integer input.
     - `func_2` reads multiple space-separated integers into a tuple.
     - `func_3` calculates the total profit based on the given logic.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main function `func_4` processes each test case.
     - It initializes a min-heap (`heap`) and a list (`remaining_items`) to store items.
     - It reads the number of items `n` and the threshold `k`.
     - It reads the prices `prices` and bonuses `bonuses` for each item.
     - It converts the prices to negative values to use a min-heap for the smallest sums.
     - It combines the negative prices and bonuses into a list `combined` and sorts it based on bonuses.
     - It pushes the top `k` items with the highest bonuses into the heap.
     - If there are remaining items, it calculates the profit using `func_3`.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The function iterates through the remaining items, updating the profit based on whether the sum of the itemâ€™s price and bonus is non-negative.
   - It uses the heap to manage the items and update the profit accordingly.
   - The logic ensures that the maximum possible profit is calculated by considering the optimal choices for both Alice and Bob.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when `k` is zero, ensuring that Bob takes all items for free.
   - The sorting and heap operations ensure that the algorithm considers the best possible outcomes for both players.

5. **Output:**
   - The final profit is printed for each test case.

However, upon closer inspection, there are some issues with the logic and the implementation:

- **Heap Initialization and Usage:**
  - The heap is initialized with the top `k` items with the highest bonuses. This is correct for the first part of the logic.
  - However, the logic for updating the profit using `func_3` and managing the heap afterward is flawed. Specifically, the way the heap is used and updated does not align with the problem's requirements.

- **Profit Calculation:**
  - The profit calculation in the loop where `combined` items are processed is incorrect. The logic should consider the optimal choice for Alice and Bob, but the current implementation does not correctly reflect this.

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - The problem requires Alice to maximize her profit and Bob to minimize it. The current implementation does not fully capture this dynamic interaction. The heap management and profit calculation need to be more precise.

Given these issues, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
