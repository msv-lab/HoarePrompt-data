Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions and Usage**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list.
   - `func_2()` reads an integer input from standard input.
   - `func_3()` reads a space-separated input and returns a tuple of integers.
   - `func_4()` reads a string input from standard input and returns it after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - `func_5()` is the main function that implements the logic to solve the problem.

2. **Problem Description and Functionality**:
   - The problem requires finding the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and maximum value equals \( m \).
   - The function `func_5()`:
     - First, it determines the value \( v \) by querying the maximum possible value for the entire array.
     - Then, it tries to divide the array into \( k \) subarrays with the product of their length and maximum value equal to \( v \).
     - If successful, it prints the value \( m \) and the indices of the start of each subarray.
     - If not, it prints `-1`.

3. **Analysis of `func_5()`**:
   - The function correctly initializes the value \( v \) by querying the maximum possible value for the entire array.
   - It then attempts to divide the array into \( k \) subarrays with the product of their length and maximum value equal to \( v \). This part of the logic seems to be implemented correctly.
   - If it successfully divides the array into \( k \) subarrays, it prints the correct value and the indices of the start of each subarray.
   - If it fails to divide the array into \( k \) subarrays, it correctly prints `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_5()` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
