Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, and they are the result of the function `func_3()`**.

This means that the function `func_3()` has been called, and it has returned new values for `n` and `k` that still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4. The exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified since `func_3()` is not defined, but we know they meet the given constraints.
