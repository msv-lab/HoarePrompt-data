Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable that starts from `n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` set to `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `n`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to a value that is greater than or equal to 0. Given that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4), `i` will always be valid to start the loop.

4. **Consider Other Given States**: The other given states are:
   - `k`: A positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.
   - `v`: Initialized to 1.

5. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop itself only depends on `i`, and `i` is set to `n` at the start of the loop, we don't need to adjust `k` or `v`. However, we need to ensure that `i` is correctly initialized to `n`.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect the initial value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `v` is 1**
