Output State: n is divided into segments of size k, and for each segment, a value v is printed. If all elements in a segment are processed (cnt == 0) and all elements are visited (l == n + 1), then the total sum of v for each segment is printed and the function func_2() is called.

In simpler terms:
Output State: The number n is split into parts of size k, and for each part, a value v is printed. Once all values in a part are processed and all parts are checked, the sum of v for each part is printed, and a function is called.
