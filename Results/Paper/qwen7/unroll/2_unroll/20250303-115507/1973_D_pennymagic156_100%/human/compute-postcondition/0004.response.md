Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n // k + 1):` will execute if the value of `n // k + 1` is at least 1.
   - This means `n // k` must be greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `n // k` is at least 0. This implies that `n` must be non-negative (greater than or equal to 0) and `k` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

4. **Formulate the final state**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 1 and increment by 1 until `i` reaches `n // k + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0 and `k` must be greater than 0**.
