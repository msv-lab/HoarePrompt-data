### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Usage**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are defined to handle different types of input and output operations as per the problem statement.
   - `func_5` is the main function that implements the logic to solve the problem.

2. **Function `func_5` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by reading `n` and `k` using `func_3()`, which returns a tuple of integers.
   - It initializes `v` to 1 and iterates backward from `n` to 1, querying the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`. This helps in determining the initial value of `v`.
   - After determining `v`, it attempts to divide the array into `k` subarrays such that each subarray’s `f(l, r)` equals `v`.
   - It uses nested loops to check if it can split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray’s `f(l, r)` equals `v`. If successful, it prints the answer and returns.
   - If it fails to find such a split, it prints `-1`.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The queries are formatted correctly and flushed properly.
   - The program handles the interaction protocol correctly by reading responses and making subsequent queries based on those responses.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where no valid split is found by printing `-1` and exiting.
   - The logic seems to cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.

5. **Correctness**:
   - Based on the provided annotated program and the problem description, the function `func_5` appears to implement the required logic correctly.
   - The program interacts with the user as specified and handles the constraints appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The given program is designed to solve the problem as described, and the logic within `func_5` seems to be implemented correctly based on the provided information.

**Correctness: True**
