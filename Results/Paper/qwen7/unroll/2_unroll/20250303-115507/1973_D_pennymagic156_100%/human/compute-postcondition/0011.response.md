Functionality: **The function divides the integer `n` into groups where each group's sum is equal to `v`, and the number of such groups is `n//k + 1`. If successful, it prints the starting index of each group followed by `! {group_index * v}`. If it cannot form the required groups, it prints `! -1`. The function ultimately returns `None`.**
