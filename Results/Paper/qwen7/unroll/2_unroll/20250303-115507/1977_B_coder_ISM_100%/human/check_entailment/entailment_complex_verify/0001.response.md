### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a list `s` representing the binary representation of `x`.
   - It iterates over the bits of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
   - If the bit at position `i` is set (`x & pow(2, i)`), it appends `'1'` to the list `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting the List `s`:**
   - The program then iterates over the list `s` to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a flag `flag` to track whether the previous element was changed to `-1`.
   - If `flag` is set and the current element is `'0'`, it changes the current element to `'1'` and resets the flag.
   - If `flag` is not set and the current and next elements are both `'1'`, it changes the current element to `'-'` and sets the flag.
   - If the flag is set and the last element is `'0'`, it changes the last element to `'1'` and increments the length.
   - Otherwise, it ensures no two consecutive `-1` and `1` elements exist by swapping them if necessary.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the list `s` (which represents the number of elements in the array).
   - It then prints the elements of the list `s`.

### Detailed Verification

#### Correctness of Binary Representation
- The program correctly constructs the binary representation of `x` using bitwise operations. This part is correct.

#### Ensuring No Two Consecutive Non-Zero Elements
- The logic for ensuring no two consecutive non-zero elements is implemented correctly. However, let's verify the specific steps:
  - The flag `flag` is used to track whether the previous element was changed to `-1`.
  - If `flag` is set and the current element is `'0'`, it changes the current element to `'1'` and resets the flag.
  - If `flag` is not set and the current and next elements are both `'1'`, it changes the current element to `'-'` and sets the flag.
  - If the flag is set and the last element is `'0'`, it changes the last element to `'1'` and increments the length.
  - Otherwise, it ensures no two consecutive `-1` and `1` elements exist by swapping them if necessary.

#### Handling Edge Cases
- The program handles edge cases such as when the last element is `'0'` and needs to be changed to `'1'` to satisfy the constraints.
- The program also handles the case where the last element is `'1'` and needs to be swapped with the preceding `-1` to avoid consecutive `-1` and `1` elements.

### Potential Issues

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the last element is `'0'` and needs to be changed to `'1'`.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the last element when the flag is set and the last element is `'0'`. The program directly changes the last element to `'1'` without considering the possibility of having a `-1` before it, which could lead to invalid sequences.

2. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The swapping logic to handle consecutive `-1` and `1` elements is implemented correctly but might not cover all edge cases. Specifically, the swapping logic might not handle all possible invalid sequences correctly.

### Conclusion

Upon closer inspection, the program does not fully handle all edge cases and might produce invalid sequences in some scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment is not entirely accurate.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
