### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the necessary inputs: the length of the array `n`, the modulus value `m`, the array `a`, and the string of commands `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of the array `a` based on the commands.
   - It uses two pointers `l` and `r` to traverse the array from both ends.
   - For each command, it appends the appropriate element from the array to `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.
   - However, the logic inside the loop is incorrect. Instead of appending the elements directly to `b` based on the command, it should calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array and append the result to `b`.

3. **Product Calculation**:
   - The function should maintain a running product of the elements in the array as it processes the commands.
   - After processing each command, it should compute the remainder of the product with `m` and append it to the result list `ans`.

4. **Reversal and Return**:
   - The function incorrectly reverses the list `ans` before returning it. This is unnecessary because the product calculation should naturally produce the correct order.

### Correctness:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to compute the remainders of the products as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the product calculation and the removal of elements from the array.

Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
