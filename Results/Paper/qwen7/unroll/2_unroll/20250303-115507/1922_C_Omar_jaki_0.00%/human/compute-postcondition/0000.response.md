Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9); `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.**

The lambda function `r` is defined but does not modify any existing variables. It does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, or `y_i`. The lambda function simply reads multiple integers from input and splits them into a tuple of integers.
