The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is non-zero. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Since `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9); `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces; `t` is now the first integer from the input split by spaces.**
