Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.
2. The annotated program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
3. The program then uses a nested loop to iterate through possible values of `i` from 1 to `b` and calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This formula seems to be derived from the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. The variable `suma` accumulates the sum of these `x` values for each `i`.
5. Finally, the program prints `suma - 1` for each test case.

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to check if the logic used in the nested loop correctly counts the number of valid pairs (a, b).

Let's analyze the formula used in the program:
- The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is derived from the condition that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, this formula might not directly count the number of valid pairs as intended.

Given the example provided:
- For the test case (10, 8), the expected output is 14.
- The program calculates the sum of `x` values for each `i` from 1 to 8 and subtracts 1 from the total sum.

Let's manually verify the calculation for the test case (10, 8):
- For `i = 1`: \(x = (10 - 1*0) // 1^2 + 1 = 11\)
- For `i = 2`: \(x = (10 - 2*1) // 2^2 + 1 = 3\)
- For `i = 3`: \(x = (10 - 3*2) // 3^2 + 1 = 0\)
- For `i = 4`: \(x = (10 - 4*3) // 4^2 + 1 = 0\)
- For `i = 5`: \(x = (10 - 5*4) // 5^2 + 1 = 0\)
- For `i = 6`: \(x = (10 - 6*5) // 6^2 + 1 = 0\)
- For `i = 7`: \(x = (10 - 7*6) // 7^2 + 1 = 0\)
- For `i = 8`: \(x = (10 - 8*7) // 8^2 + 1 = 0\)

Summing these values: \(11 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 14\)

This matches the expected output for the test case (10, 8).

Since the program logic appears to correctly implement the required calculation based on the given examples and the problem constraints, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
