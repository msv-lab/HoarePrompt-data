Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program uses a formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to calculate the number of valid pairs, which does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem description.

To verify this, let's consider a specific example:

For the input `10 8`, the expected output is `14`. However, the program calculates the result using the formula, which does not correctly account for all valid pairs.

Let's manually check some pairs to see why the program fails:

- For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 2\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(2 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 3\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(3 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\), \(a + b = 4\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\). Since \(4 \mod 2 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 3\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 4\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(4 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 4\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 5\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(5 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 5\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 6\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(6 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 6\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 7\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(7 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 6\) and \(b = 2\), \(a + b = 8\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\). Since \(8 \mod 4 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3\), \(a + b = 9\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 3 \cdot 3 = 9\). Since \(9 \mod 9 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 7\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 8\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(8 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 8\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 9\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(9 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 9\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 10\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(10 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 10\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 11\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(11 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.

This gives us 14 valid pairs, which matches the expected output. However, the program does not correctly calculate this result, indicating that the logic used in the program is flawed.
