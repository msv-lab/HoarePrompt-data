Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m` for each case. This part is correct.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program aims to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The key part of the logic is the nested loop where it iterates over possible values of `i` from 1 to `b` and calculates `x` using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\). This formula seems to be derived from the condition \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).

3. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is intended to count the number of valid `a` values for a fixed `i` and `b`.
   - However, the formula is not directly related to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it appears to be an attempt to simplify the problem, but it might not correctly capture all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `a` and `b` are very large or when `a + b` is not a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Final Output**:
   - The final output is the sum `suma` minus one, which is printed for each test case. This part of the logic is correct in terms of printing the result, but the calculation itself might be incorrect.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The formula used in the program does not accurately reflect the problem requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
