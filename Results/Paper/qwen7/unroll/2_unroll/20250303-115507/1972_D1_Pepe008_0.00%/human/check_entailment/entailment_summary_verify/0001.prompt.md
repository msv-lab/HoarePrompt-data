You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each pair \((a, b)\), it calculates a sum based on a specific formula and prints the sum minus one. The function does not return any explicit value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\) from input.
   - It initializes a variable `suma` to store the count of valid pairs.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
     - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\).
     - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in the code does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Instead, it uses a different approach involving the formula \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\), which seems to be derived from some mathematical insight but is not clearly explained.
   - The formula \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\) is not directly related to the problem statement and does not seem to correctly implement the required condition.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The current implementation does not perform this check and instead uses an unclear formula.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It uses an incorrect formula and does not verify the required condition.
