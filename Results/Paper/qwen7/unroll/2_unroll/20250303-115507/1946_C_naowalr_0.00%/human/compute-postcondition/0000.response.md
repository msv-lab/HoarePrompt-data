Output State: **`t` is an integer read from stdin, representing the number of test cases.**

The code reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial conditions for `n`, `k`, and the adjacency list `adj` remain unchanged and are still valid for each test case yet to be processed.
