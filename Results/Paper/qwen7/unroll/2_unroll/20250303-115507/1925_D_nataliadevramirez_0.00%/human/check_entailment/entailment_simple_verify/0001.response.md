### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for \( k \) excursions.
   - For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The initial friendship values are given, and we need to compute the expected sum of these values after \( k \) excursions.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function takes \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and a list of friendships as input.
   - It iterates through each friendship and calculates the contribution to the result.
   - The formula used is \( f \times \left( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \right) \).
     - Here, \( f \) is the initial friendship value.
     - \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) represents the number of times the friendship value will increase due to the random selection of the pair over \( k \) excursions.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function handles the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), followed by the list of friendships.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the expected increase in friendship values for each pair.
   - The formula \( f \times \left( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \right) \) is derived from the fact that each pair of friends has an equal probability of being chosen, and the friendship value increases linearly with each selection.
   - The use of modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits and avoids overflow issues.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the constraints appropriately, including the maximum values for \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - The input format and processing are correct according to the problem statement.

6. **Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - The function iterates through each friendship and calculates the expected increase in friendship values.
     - The formula \( f \times \left( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \right) \) is correct because it accounts for the expected number of times each friendship value will increase over \( k \) excursions.
     - The modulo operation ensures the result is within the required bounds.
   - **Function 2:**
     - The function correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each one.
     - The input reading and processing logic is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.
