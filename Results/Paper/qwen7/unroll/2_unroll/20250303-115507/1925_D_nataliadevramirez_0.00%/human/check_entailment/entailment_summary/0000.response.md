Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
2. The solution involves two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_1` calculates the sum of friendship values for all pairs of friends and multiplies this sum by the combination of `k` taken 2 at a time, then returns the result modulo \( MOD \).
4. `func_2` processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each test case and printing the result.

Let's analyze the correctness of the solution:

- **func_1**:
  - The function correctly calculates the sum of friendship values for all pairs of friends.
  - It then multiplies this sum by \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \), which represents the expected number of times each pair will be chosen over \( k \) excursions.
  - The result is returned modulo \( MOD \).

- **func_2**:
  - The function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the number of children, pairs of friends, and the number of excursions.
  - It then reads the list of friendships and calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
  - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, both functions appear to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The calculations and operations are consistent with the problem statement.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
