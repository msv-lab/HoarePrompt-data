Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function reads the input values for `n` and the two binary strings.
   - It then attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest string `s` by checking if the first string `a[0]` has a '1' at position `i+1` and the second string `a[1]` has a '0' at position `i`. If this condition is met, it constructs `s` by concatenating the relevant parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
   - The variable `x` is used to record the position where the construction of `s` was last modified.
   - The function then checks if the prefix of `a[0]` up to `x` matches the prefix of `s` up to `x`. If a match is found, it updates `t` to reflect the number of matching characters plus one.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed string `s` and the value of `t`.

2. **Issues Identified**:
   - The function does not correctly handle the construction of the lexicographically smallest string `s`. Specifically, the logic for constructing `s` is flawed because it only considers one specific condition (`a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`) and does not account for other possible ways to form the smallest string.
   - The variable `t` is set to 1 regardless of the actual number of paths that yield the smallest string, which is incorrect.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - Based on the example provided, the function does not produce the correct output. For instance, in the first test case, the correct lexicographically smallest string is "000" and there are 2 paths that yield this string, but the function outputs "000" and "1".
   - In the second test case, the correct lexicographically smallest string is "11000" and there is only 1 path that yields this string, but the function outputs "11000" and "1".

Given the analysis, the function does not correctly implement the required logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and count the number of paths that yield this string.

Correctness: **False**
