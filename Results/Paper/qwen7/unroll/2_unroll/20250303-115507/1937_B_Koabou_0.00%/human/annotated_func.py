#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings of length n are provided representing the values of a_{1j} and a_{2j} for 1 ≤ j ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the inputs provided during the loop executions, `n` is an input integer.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the inputs provided during the loop executions, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list resulting from the loop's conditions, `x` is an integer indicating the position where the loop modified the list `s`.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 1, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the inputs provided during the loop executions, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list resulting from the loop's conditions, `x` is an integer indicating the position where the loop modified the list `s`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `x-1`. If the substring of `a[0]` up to index `i+1` matches the substring of `s` up to index `i+1`, it sets `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks out of the loop. Since the loop head specifies `i` in `range(x)`, the maximum value for `i` is `x-1`. Therefore, the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` can only match if `a[0]` and `s` are identical or if they start with the same prefix up to some point. However, without specific values for `a[0]` and `s`, we cannot determine the exact value of `t` after the loop. Given the initial state and the loop logic, `t` remains 1 unless a match is found within the loop, but since no specific values are provided, we assume no match is found, keeping `t` at its initial value of 1. Other variables remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: [s]
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, and two binary strings of length `n`. It compares parts of these binary strings and constructs a new string `s` based on certain conditions. After processing, it prints the constructed string `s` and the integer `t`, which is always set to 1 unless a specific condition is met during the comparison process.
