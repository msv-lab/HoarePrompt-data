Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `idx` is set to 1.
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `k` is an integer input from the user, with the constraints \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.
   - `permutation` is a list of length `n` where every `i` index that is a multiple of `k + j` for `j` in range(`k`) contains the value `j // (k // 2) + 1`.

2. **Understanding the `permutation` List**:
   - For each `i` in the range of `n`, if `i % (k + j) == 0` for any `j` in the range `[0, k-1]`, then the value at `permutation[i]` is `j // (k // 2) + 1`.
   - Since `k` is even, `k // 2` is an integer. For example, if `k = 4`, then `k // 2 = 2`, and the formula becomes `j // 2 + 1`.

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - Let's assume `k = 4` and `n = 8` (these are valid inputs based on the constraints).
   - The indices that need to be filled are those that are multiples of `k + j` for `j` in `[0, 3]`:
     - For `j = 0`, `k + j = 4`, so `i` should be a multiple of 4.
     - For `j = 1`, `k + j = 5`, so `i` should be a multiple of 5.
     - For `j = 2`, `k + j = 6`, so `i` should be a multiple of 6.
     - For `j = 3`, `k + j = 7`, so `i` should be a multiple of 7.
   - The values at these indices are:
     - `permutation[4] = 0 // 2 + 1 = 1`
     - `permutation[5] = 1 // 2 + 1 = 2`
     - `permutation[6] = 2 // 2 + 1 = 3`
     - `permutation[7] = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`

4. **Result String**:
   - The `result` string is constructed by taking the space-separated integers from the `permutation` list.
   - Given the above example, the `permutation` list would look like this: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, ...]` (with zeros filling the remaining positions).

5. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the `result` string, which contains the space-separated integers from the `permutation` list.

Given the above steps, the output will be a string of space-separated integers based on the `permutation` list described. 

Output: **a string of space-separated integers based on the `permutation` list, where each index that is a multiple of `k + j` for `j` in range(`k`) contains the value `j // (k // 2) + 1`**.
