Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop**: The loop condition is `t > 0`. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Current state before the loop**: The current state is that `t` is an input integer.

4. **Determine if adjustment is needed**: Since the loop condition requires `t > 0`, and we know that `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
