Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `k` is even**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are specified to be set within the test cases which haven't been processed yet.
