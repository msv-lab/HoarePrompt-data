Output State: **`idx` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, and both are such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` containing `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The line `idx = 0` initializes the variable `idx` to 0. All other variables (`n`, `k`, and `permutation`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
