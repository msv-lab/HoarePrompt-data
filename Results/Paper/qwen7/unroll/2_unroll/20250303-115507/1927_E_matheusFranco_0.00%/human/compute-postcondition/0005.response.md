Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `idx` is initially 1.
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `k` is an integer input from the user, and it satisfies the condition \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.
   - `permutation` is a list of length `n` containing `n` zeros.
   - `idx_v` is 1.
   - `curr_v` is 1.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < k`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`.
   - Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is an input from the user.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `k` remains as an integer input from the user (no specific adjustment needed).

So, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `k` is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` containing `n` zeros, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 1**.
