Output State: `idx` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, and both are such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where every `i` index that is a multiple of `k + j` for `j` in range(`k`) contains the value `j // (k // 2) + 1`, and `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k`. 

In simpler terms, the `permutation` list will have its indices set to specific values based on the rules of the loop. For each `i` in the range of `k`, starting from `i`, every `k`-th index will be filled with a value that increments by 1 for each complete cycle through the range `k`.
