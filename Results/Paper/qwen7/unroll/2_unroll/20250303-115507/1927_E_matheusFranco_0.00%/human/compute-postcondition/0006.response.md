Output State: `idx` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, and both are such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where every `i` index that is a multiple of `k + j` for `j` in range(`k`) is filled with values starting from `1` up to `n`, and `idx_v` is 1.
