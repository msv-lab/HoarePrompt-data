You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: Output State: `idx` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, and both are such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where every `i` index that is a multiple of `k + j` for `j` in range(`k`) contains the value `j // (k // 2) + 1`, and `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k`. 
    #
    #In simpler terms, the `permutation` list will have its indices set to specific values based on the rules of the loop. For each `i` in the range of `k`, starting from `i`, every `k`-th index will be filled with a value that increments by 1 for each complete cycle through the range `k`.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: a string of space-separated integers based on the `permutation` list, where each index that is a multiple of `k + j` for `j` in range(`k`) contains the value `j // (k // 2) + 1`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
