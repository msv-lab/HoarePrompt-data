Output State: `t` is an integer representing the number of iterations the loop executed, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is `t + 2`, `results` is a list containing the outputs of `func_1(path)` for each iteration, where `path` is a string from the `data` list starting from the element at index `index - t - 1` and incremented by 1 for each iteration.
