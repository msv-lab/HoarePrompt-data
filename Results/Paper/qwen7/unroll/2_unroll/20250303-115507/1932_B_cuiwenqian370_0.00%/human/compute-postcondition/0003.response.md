Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element in the list `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from `sys.stdin.read` on whitespace, `index` is 1**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `index` to 1. This does not affect the values of `t` or `data`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer equal to the first element in the list `data`, and `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from `sys.stdin.read` on whitespace.
