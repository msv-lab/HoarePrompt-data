The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`. The parameter `path` is expected to be a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and the length of the list `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. Additionally, there is an integer `t` that satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, though it is not directly used as a parameter in the function signature.

The functionality of the function `func_1` is to either return 0 or return the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `path`, which is a list of integers. It returns 0 or the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity.**
