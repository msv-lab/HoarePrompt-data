Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` groups of data. Each group consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. For each group, the function performs some operation based on these inputs and returns the results accordingly.**
