Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the `results` list, so the objects involved are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a path string from the `data` list.
   - `index` is `t + 2`.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace.
   - `t` is the number of iterations in the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate as long as there are elements in the `results` list. Since `results` contains `t` elements, the loop will run `t` times.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The loop will start with the first element of `results` and continue until all elements are processed.
   - For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element (i.e., `t` must be at least 1).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `results` must contain at least one element.
- `t` must be at least 1.

Since `index` is `t + 2`, if `t` is at least 1, then `index` will be at least 3.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing at least one element, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is at least 3**.
