Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the Input Process**: The input process is `int(input())`, which means the loop will run as many times as the integer value entered by the user.

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**: Since the loop will execute based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is valid (i.e., a positive integer). Additionally, we need to ensure that the initial state of other variables (`n`, `q`, `c`, `l_i`, `r_i`) is consistent with the constraints provided (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5 and elements of `c` are between 1 and 10^9).

4. **Formulate the Final State**: We need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute correctly. This involves ensuring that the input value is a positive integer and that the other variables are initialized within their respective constraints.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, ensuring it is a positive integer. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `c`, `l_i`, `r_i`) should be initialized within their constraints, but since they are not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, we do not need to adjust their states directly here.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer**
