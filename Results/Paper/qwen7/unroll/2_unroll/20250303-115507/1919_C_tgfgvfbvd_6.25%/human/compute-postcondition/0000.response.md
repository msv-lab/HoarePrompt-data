Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value, which is converted to an integer using `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as the input value (converted to an integer) is a non-negative integer.
   - Given the constraint `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the input value must be within this range for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, we need to ensure that the input value is within this range.
   - The variable `t` itself is not directly used in the loop, but the loop depends on the input value being a valid integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, ensuring it falls within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input value must be a positive integer within this range**
