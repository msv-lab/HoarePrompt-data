Output State: The output state consists of two integers separated by a space, representing the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` after all iterations of the loop have finished. These indices are determined based on the comparisons made between elements of the permutation \( p \) through the interactions with the external entity, as specified in the loop body.
