Output State: The output state will consist of two numbers separated by a space. The first number represents the index `mak2`, and the second number represents the index `pans[mak]` after executing all iterations of the loop. These indices are determined based on comparisons made between elements of the permutation \( p \) through a series of queries. The exact values depend on the specific permutation \( p \) and the outcomes of the comparisons made during the loop executions.
