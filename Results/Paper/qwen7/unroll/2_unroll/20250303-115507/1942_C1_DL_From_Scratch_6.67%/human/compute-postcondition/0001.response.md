State: **`T` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `T` in the expression `range(T)`.
2. For the `range(T)` function to generate a sequence of numbers, `T` must be a non-negative integer.
3. The problem statement specifies that `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), inclusive.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `T` must satisfy the condition of being greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

Hence, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `T` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
