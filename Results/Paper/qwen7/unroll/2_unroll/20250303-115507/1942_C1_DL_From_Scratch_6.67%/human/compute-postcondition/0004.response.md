Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t, integers n, x, and y, and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It returns a value based on the conditions specified for n, x, and y.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters (t, n, x, y, and a list of integers). The function processes these parameters according to the given constraints and returns a result based on the conditions provided.
