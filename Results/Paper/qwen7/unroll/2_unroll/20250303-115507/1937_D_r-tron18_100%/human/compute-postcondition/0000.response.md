Output State: **`pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`; `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The code creates a list comprehension that iterates over the enumerated elements of `s1`. For each index `i` where the element `el` is '>', it adds `i + 1` to the list `pre`. The original string `s1` and its length `n` remain unchanged. The list `pre` contains the positions (indices + 1) of all '>' characters in `s1`.
