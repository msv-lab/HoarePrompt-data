Output State: **`balance` is 0; `details` is a list of tuples sorted by the first element; `result` is a string created by joining the third elements of each tuple in `details`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)` iterates over the `details` list and concatenates the third element of each tuple into a string. This operation does not affect the `balance` or the order of the `details` list, but it introduces a new variable `result` which contains the concatenated string of the third elements from each tuple in `details`.
