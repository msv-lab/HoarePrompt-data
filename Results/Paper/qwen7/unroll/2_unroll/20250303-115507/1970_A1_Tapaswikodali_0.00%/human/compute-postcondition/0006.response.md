Output State: **`balance` is 0; `details` is a list of tuples sorted by the first element (balance value at each iteration)**.

Explanation: The `details` list contains tuples where each tuple represents the balance value at each iteration, `-i` (where `i` is the index of the character in the string `s`), and the character from the string `s`. The `sort()` method sorts the `details` list based on the first element of each tuple, which is the balance value. The `balance` variable itself does not change; it remains 0. The `details` list is now sorted by the balance values.
