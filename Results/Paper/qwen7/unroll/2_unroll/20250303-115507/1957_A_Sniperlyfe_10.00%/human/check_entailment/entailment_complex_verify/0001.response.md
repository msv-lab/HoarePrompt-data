### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding and Input/Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths into an array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It iterates over the array `arr`, updating the frequency of each stick length.
   - It calculates the number of complete polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 (since each polygon has 4 sides).
   - It sums up these values to get the total number of polygons.

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness:**
   - The function correctly handles cases where the number of sticks of a particular length is less than 4. When the frequency of a stick length is less than 4, the division `v // 4` will result in 0, meaning no polygon can be formed with that length.
   - The function also correctly handles cases where there are multiple unique stick lengths. It ensures that each unique stick length contributes to the total count of polygons based on its frequency.

4. **Output Validation:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(arr)` for each test case, which is the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed.

### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
- The function `func_1` accurately calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by iterating through the stick lengths and counting the number of complete polygons that can be made from each unique stick length.
- The division by 4 ensures that only complete polygons are counted, and the summation of these values gives the total number of polygons.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and accurately solves the problem as described.
