Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `s` (a string), `k` (a positive integer), and `n` (a positive integer). It returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, followed by a substring of `s` starting from the index `r * k` and going to the end, and finally the string `s2`.**
