### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to filter out characters from `s` that belong to the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and store them in `s1`. If `s1` originally contained exactly one character from the first `k` alphabets, `s2` will contain that character; otherwise, `s2` will be empty.
   - However, the function has a logical flaw. When `len(alphabet)` is 1, it should append the character to `s2` and reset `alphabet` to its initial state. Instead, it appends the character to `s1` and resets `alphabet` to an empty set, which means `s2` will always be empty in this case.
   - Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `s1` might not contain enough characters to form all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Main Program Analysis:**
   - The main program correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1` and handling the results.
   - However, the logic for constructing `be9i` assumes that `s1` contains all necessary characters to form a valid subsequence of length `n`. This assumption is flawed because `func_1` might not have correctly filtered out all necessary characters due to the logical error mentioned above.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly identify if the string `s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where `s1` might not contain enough characters.
   - The main program logic relies on the incorrect behavior of `func_1`, leading to potential incorrect outputs.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
