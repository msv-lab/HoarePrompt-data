Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `i` is a variable that will take each character from `s` in each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. Therefore, the loop will start executing if `s` is non-empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `s` is initially an empty string (`s1` is an empty string), the loop will not execute because there are no characters in `s`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `s` must contain at least one character.

5. **Consider the role of `i`**: `i` will take each character from `s` in each iteration. For the loop to start, `i` should be initialized to the first character of `s`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `s` (to ensure it contains at least one character) and `i` (to be initialized to the first character of `s`).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` >= 1) comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the first character in the string `s`**
