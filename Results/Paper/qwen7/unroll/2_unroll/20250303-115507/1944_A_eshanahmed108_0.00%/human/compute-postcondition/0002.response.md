Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed based on the condition `n if n - k <= 1 else 1` for each test case. For each test case, if the value of `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, the number `n` will be printed; otherwise, the number `1` will be printed. The total number of outputs will be equal to the number of test cases provided as input.
