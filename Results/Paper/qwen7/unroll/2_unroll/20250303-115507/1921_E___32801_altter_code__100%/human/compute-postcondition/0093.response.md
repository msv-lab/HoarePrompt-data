Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is a list containing six integers `[n, m, x1 + a, y1, x2 - a, y2]`. `b` is the difference between `x2 - a` and `x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. Additionally, the following conditions hold: `b // 2 \leq a`, or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, or `y1 > y2`, or at least one of `(1 > y1 > m)` or `(1 > x1 > n)` is true.
