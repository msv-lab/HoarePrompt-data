Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers \([n, m, x1 + a, y, x2 - a, y2]\).
- `b` is the value of \((x2 - a) - x1\), and this difference is even.
- `y` is either \(y2 - 1\) or \(0\), depending on whether \(y2 \leq y1\) or not.
- If \(y2 \leq y1\), then `y` is \(0\) and `t` is equal to the absolute value of \(1 - y1\).
- If \(y2 > y1\), then `y` is \(y2 - 1\) and `t` is equal to the absolute value of \(y2 - y1\).
- `c` is either \(y1 - 1\) or \(m - y1\), depending on the same condition as above.
- The condition \((x2 > x1 \text{ and } x1 \geq 1 \text{ and } x2 \leq n)\) does not hold.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('draw')
```

Given the information, the print statement will output the string `'draw'`.

Output: **'draw'**
