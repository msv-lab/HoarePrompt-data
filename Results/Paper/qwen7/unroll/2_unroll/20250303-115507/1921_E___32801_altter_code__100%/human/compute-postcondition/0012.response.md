Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1, y1 + 1, x2, y2], where n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 are the integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, x2 is greater than x1, the difference (x2 - x1) is odd, and y1 is not equal to y2, and currently y2 is greater than y1.**

Explanation: The value of `y1` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `r` now contains `y1 + 1` instead of the original `y1`.
