Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers \([n, m, x1 + a, y, x2 - a, y2]\).
- `b` is the value of \((x2 - a) - x1\), where \(x2 - a\) is greater than \(x1\), the difference \(((x2 - a) - x1)\) is even, and \(y = y2 - 1\).
- `t` is now equal to the absolute value of \(y2 - y1\).
- `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('draw')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'draw'`. Since no variables from the initial state are directly used in this print statement, the output will be the literal string `'draw'`.

Output: **'draw'**
