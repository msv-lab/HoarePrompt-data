Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + a, y1=1, x2 - a, y2 - a], `b` is the difference between `x2 - a` and `x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, and the current value of `y1` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `y2 -= a` subtracts `a` from the value of `y2`. Since `y2` was originally part of the list `r` and the value of `y1` is 1, the new value of `y2` is `y2 - a`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
