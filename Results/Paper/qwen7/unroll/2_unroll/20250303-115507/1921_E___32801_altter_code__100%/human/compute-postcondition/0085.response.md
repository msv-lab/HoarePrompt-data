Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + a, m, x2 - a, y2 + a], `b` is the difference between `x2 - a` and `x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `y1` is greater than `y2`, `c` is m - y2.**

The code assigns the value of `m - y2` to the variable `c`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
