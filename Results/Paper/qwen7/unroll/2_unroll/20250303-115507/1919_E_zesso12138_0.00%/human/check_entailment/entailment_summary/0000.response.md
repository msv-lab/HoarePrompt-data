Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine the number of possible initial arrays \(a\) (consisting of only 1 and -1) that can produce a given sorted prefix sum array \(p\).
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(n, p)`**: This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the binomial coefficient \(C(n, final\_sum)\), where `final_sum` is the last element of the list `p` plus an offset (`n`). This coefficient represents the number of ways to choose elements from a set of `n` items, which is relevant to counting the number of valid sequences \(a\).
   - **Function `func_2()`**: This function reads input for multiple test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, p)`, and collects the results. It then prints the results for each test case.

3. **Verification**:
   - **Test Case Handling**: The function `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases, reading the necessary inputs and processing them one by one.
   - **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: The function `func_1(n, p)` correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to calculate the binomial coefficient, which is essential for solving the problem.
   - **Modulo Operation**: The function ensures that the result is taken modulo \(998244353\), which is necessary due to the potentially large numbers involved.

Given the above analysis, both functions together correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
