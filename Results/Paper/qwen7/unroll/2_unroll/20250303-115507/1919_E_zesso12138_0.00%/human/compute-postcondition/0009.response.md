Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for res in results:`.
   - The variables involved here are `res` and `results`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `index` is currently 6.
   - `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])`.
   - `results` is a list containing the results of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop, and its length is equal to `t`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.
   - For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `results` is the key variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that it contains at least one element.
   - The length of `results` is equal to `t`, so `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `results` must contain at least one element (i.e., `len(results) >= 1`).

Given the initial state:
- `index` is 6.
- `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])`.
- `results` is a list containing the results of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop, and its length is equal to `t`.

We need to ensure that `results` has at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`index` is 6, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])`, `results` is a list containing the results of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop, and its length must be at least 1.**
