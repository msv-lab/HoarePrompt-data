Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of initial arrays `a` that result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not handle the problem as described.

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` attempts to use dynamic programming to count valid sequences, but the logic is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the process of constructing the prefix sum array `p` from an array `a` of 1s and -1s.
   - The function `dp` is initialized and updated in a way that does not accurately reflect the transitions between prefix sums that would occur when constructing `a` from `p`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases. However, the logic inside `func_1` is still flawed and will not produce the correct results for any input.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  -1 0 0
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

The correct approach involves generating all possible sequences of 1s and -1s that could produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The provided code does not achieve this, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
