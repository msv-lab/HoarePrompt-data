Output State: **`index` is 0, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a` for each test case, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order for each test case, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from `sys.stdin.read`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial state.
