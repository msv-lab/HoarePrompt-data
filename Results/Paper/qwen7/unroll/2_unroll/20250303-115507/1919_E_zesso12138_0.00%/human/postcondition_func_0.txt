The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 5000) and `p` (a sorted list of integers). It calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, final_sum), where `final_sum` is the last element of the list `p` plus an offset (`n`). The calculation is done using dynamic programming and a modulus (`MOD`) is applied to prevent overflow. The function returns the computed binomial coefficient.
