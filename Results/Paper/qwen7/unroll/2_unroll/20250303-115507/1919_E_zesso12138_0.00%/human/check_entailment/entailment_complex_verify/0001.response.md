### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to determine the number of possible initial arrays \( a \) of size \( n \) (consisting of only 1 and -1) such that the sorted prefix sums match the given sorted prefix sum array \( p \).
- The program should return the count modulo \( 998,244,353 \).

#### Function `func_1` Analysis
1. **DP Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized to zero except for `dp[n] = 1`, indicating one way to have a prefix sum of 0 at the start.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - The inner loop iterates over all possible prefix sums from 0 to \( 2n \).
   - For each prefix sum `j`, if `dp[j]` is non-zero, it updates the next possible prefix sums `j+1` and `j-1` by adding `dp[j]` to them.
   - This transition correctly models the possible changes in prefix sums due to adding 1 or -1 to the current prefix sum.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + n`, which is the last value in the sorted prefix sum array plus the offset `n`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis
1. **Input Reading**:
   - Reads the input from standard input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - Correctly handles reading multiple test cases and processing each one.

2. **Result Collection**:
   - Collects the results of `func_1` for each test case and prints them.

#### Annotations Recap
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` accurately models the transitions between prefix sums.
- The final sum calculation in `func_1` is correct.

#### Example Verification
- The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.
- The dynamic programming approach is sound for counting the number of valid sequences.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and the problem statement, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to count the number of valid initial arrays \( a \) that result in the given sorted prefix sum array \( p \).

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
