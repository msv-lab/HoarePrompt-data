### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a while loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This is correct.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes a dictionary `d` using `defaultdict`, but it does not specify what `default_value` is. This will lead to an error because `default_value` is not defined. It should be initialized with `defaultdict(int)` instead, which will handle missing keys by defaulting their values to 0.

3. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m` for each test case. It also reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

4. **Counting Problems**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s` and stores them in the dictionary `d`.

5. **Calculating Missing Problems**: The program calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. For each difficulty level, if the count in the dictionary is less than or equal to `m`, it adds `m - d[val]` to the answer. This logic is correct.

6. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case, which is correct.

However, the main issue is the undefined `default_value`. If we assume `default_value` was meant to be `int`, the program would work as intended. Without this assumption, the program will raise an error.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct, but it will fail due to the undefined `default_value`. Assuming `default_value` is `int`, the program works as intended.
