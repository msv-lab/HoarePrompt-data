Reasoning:
- The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each difficulty level in the given string `s` and then determining how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level to ensure that there are at least `m` problems for each of the `m` rounds.
- However, the code snippet provided includes an incomplete and irrelevant function `func_1()` which always returns 0. This function is not used in the main logic of the program and does not affect the correctness of the problem-solving logic.
- The main logic of the program correctly initializes a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level. It then iterates over the string `s` to populate this dictionary.
- After populating the dictionary, it calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level by comparing the count of each difficulty level with `m`. If the count is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - d[val]`) to the answer.
- The program processes each test case correctly and prints the result for each test case.

Given that the main logic of the program is correct and the irrelevant function `func_1()` does not affect the main functionality, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
