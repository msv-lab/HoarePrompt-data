Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, and t is set to the integer value entered by the user.**

The code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, after executing the code, `t` is now specifically set to the integer value entered by the user, which must still fall within the specified range.
