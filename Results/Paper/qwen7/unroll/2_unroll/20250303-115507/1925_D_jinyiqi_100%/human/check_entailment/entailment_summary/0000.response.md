Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for \( k \) excursions. The key points are:
   - Each excursion randomly selects a pair of children.
   - If the selected pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The goal is to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values at the time of selection for all \( k \) excursions.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It then iterates through each of the \( m \) pairs, summing up the friendship values \( f_i \).
   - The calculation of the expected value seems to involve some misinterpretation of the problem's requirements. Specifically:
     - The formula `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` and `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2` do not align with the expected value calculation for the problem.
     - The expected value should consider the probability of selecting each pair and the effect of increasing friendship values over excursions.
   - The program then simplifies the fraction and applies the modular inverse to compute the final result.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program's approach to calculating the expected value is incorrect. The formula used does not match the problem's requirements.
   - The expected value for each excursion should be calculated based on the probability of selecting each pair and the effect of increasing friendship values, which is not accurately reflected in the given code.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the expected value.

Correctness: **False**
