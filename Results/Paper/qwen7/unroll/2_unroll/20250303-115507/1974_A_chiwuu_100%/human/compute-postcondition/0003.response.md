Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the number of iterations the loop executed.

Explanation: The value of `t` changes based on the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be updated according to the logic inside the loop. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we cannot give a precise numerical value for `t`. However, we know that `t` will be constrained between 1 and 10^4, and it will be updated based on the conditions provided in the loop body.
