Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons. Let's break down why:

1. **Calculation of Space Needed for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates `t` as `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd. This part is correct because each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, so we need to divide by 2 and round up if necessary.
   
2. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The next step calculates `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. This should be the remaining space available after placing all 2x2 icons, but this calculation is incorrect. It should be `remaining_space = t * 15 - (b * 4)`.

3. **Placing 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program then checks if `t1 >= a` and decides whether to add more screens based on this condition. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly account for the placement of 1x1 icons within the remaining space.

4. **Final Screen Count**:
   - The final count of screens is calculated incorrectly. The program should ensure that the remaining space is divided into 15-cell chunks (since each screen has 5 * 3 = 15 cells) and possibly add an extra screen if there is any leftover space.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        t = b // 2 + (b % 2)  # Calculate number of 2x2 icons needed
        remaining_space = t * 15 - b * 4  # Remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        if remaining_space >= a:
            t += a // 15  # Add full screens for 1x1 icons
            if a % 15 != 0:
                t += 1  # Add an extra screen if there is any leftover space
        else:
            t += (a + remaining_space - 1) // 15  # Calculate additional screens needed
        print(t)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons is handled correctly and the minimum number of screens is calculated accurately.
