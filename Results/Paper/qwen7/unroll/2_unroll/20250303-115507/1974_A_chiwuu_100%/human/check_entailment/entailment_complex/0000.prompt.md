Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b
        
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the number of iterations the loop executed.
    #
    #Explanation: The value of `t` changes based on the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be updated according to the logic inside the loop. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we cannot give a precise numerical value for `t`. However, we know that `t` will be constrained between 1 and 10^4, and it will be updated based on the conditions provided in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates and updates the value of \(t\) based on specific conditions. The final value of \(t\) is printed for each test case. The value of \(t\) is constrained between 1 and \(10^4\), and it is updated according to the logic inside the loop body.
