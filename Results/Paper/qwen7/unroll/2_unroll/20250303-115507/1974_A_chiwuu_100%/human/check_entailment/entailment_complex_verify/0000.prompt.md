You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the number of iterations the loop executed.
    #
    #Explanation: The value of `t` changes based on the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be updated according to the logic inside the loop. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we cannot give a precise numerical value for `t`. However, we know that `t` will be constrained between 1 and 10^4, and it will be updated based on the conditions provided in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates and updates the value of \(t\) based on specific conditions. The final value of \(t\) is printed for each test case. The value of \(t\) is constrained between 1 and \(10^4\), and it is updated according to the logic inside the loop body.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Let's analyze a specific case to demonstrate this:

Consider the input `12 4`. According to the problem description, we need to place 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2. 

- Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so 4 icons of size 2x2 occupy \(4 \times 4 = 16\) cells.
- Each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell, so 12 icons of size 1x1 occupy 12 cells.

Since each screen has \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cells, we can fit all 16 cells occupied by the 2x2 icons and 12 cells occupied by the 1x1 icons on one screen. Therefore, the minimum number of screens needed is 1.

However, the program calculates the number of screens as follows:
1. It calculates `t` as the number of 2x2 icons divided by 2, rounding up if necessary.
2. It then calculates `t1` as \(t \times 15 - b \times 4\).
3. It checks if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons). If not, it calculates additional screens needed based on the remaining space.

Let's walk through the calculation for `12 4`:
- \(t = \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2\)
- \(t1 = 2 \times 15 - 4 \times 4 = 30 - 16 = 14\)
- Since \(t1 = 14 < 12\), it calculates additional screens: \(t2 = 12 - 14 = -2\), which is not possible, so it adds 1 more screen.

Thus, the program outputs 2 screens, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 1 screen.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for the given problem description and is incorrect.
