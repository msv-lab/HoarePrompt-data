Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated for each iteration of the loop. For each input 'n' and string 's', if the count of '1's is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'. If the count of '1's is greater than 2 and odd, or equal to 1, it prints 'NO'. If '11' is found in the string 's', it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
