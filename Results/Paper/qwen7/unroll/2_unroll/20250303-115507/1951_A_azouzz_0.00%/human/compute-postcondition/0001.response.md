State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t`, which is used as the range parameter.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
- The variables `start` and `end` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
