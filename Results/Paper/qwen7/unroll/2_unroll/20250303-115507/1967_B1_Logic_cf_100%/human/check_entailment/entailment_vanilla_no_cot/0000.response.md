Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down why it is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs using a formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\). This formula does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **GCD Calculation Missing**:
   - The code does not include any calculation involving the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\), which is a crucial part of the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and checks if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count.
