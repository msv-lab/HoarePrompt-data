Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Description Analysis
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program has the following structure:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `ans` as `n` initially and then adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. This does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **No Iteration Over All Possible Pairs**: The program does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\). Instead, it only considers a fixed `b` and adds a constant value to `ans`, which is incorrect.
3. **Missing Condition Check**: There is no check to ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for any pair \((a, b)\).

### Example Counterexample
Consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
- Expected output: 14
- The program's output is incorrect because it does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

For instance, let's take \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3\):
- \(a + b = 6 + 3 = 9\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 3 \cdot \gcd(6, 3) = 3 \cdot 3 = 9\)
- Since \(9\) is a multiple of \(9\), \((6, 3)\) should be counted.
- However, the program does not correctly handle this case, leading to an incorrect count.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
