Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers `n` and `m`. The function validates that `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6. Additionally, the sum of `n` and `m` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6. Based on these inputs, the function determines whether the conditions are met and returns appropriate validation results for each test case.**
