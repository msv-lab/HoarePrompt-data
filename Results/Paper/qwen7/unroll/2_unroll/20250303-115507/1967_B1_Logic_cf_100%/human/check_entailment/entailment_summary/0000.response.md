Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) but uses an incorrect formula. Specifically, the line `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` does not accurately reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To verify this, let's analyze the problem requirements and compare them with the program logic:

1. **Problem Requirement**: We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Program Logic**: The program iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\) and adds a value to `ans` based on the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)`. This formula does not account for the condition involving the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd(a, b)\)).

Let's consider a few examples to illustrate the discrepancy:

- For the test case \((n, m) = (10, 8)\):
  - The correct answer should be 14, as mentioned in the example output.
  - However, the program's logic does not correctly account for the gcd condition, leading to an incorrect result.

Given these observations, the program does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
