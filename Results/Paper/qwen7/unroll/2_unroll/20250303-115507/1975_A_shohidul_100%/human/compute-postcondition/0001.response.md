Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: According to the problem, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer input from the user. The value of `t` is between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input, it can be any positive integer within the given range.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not mentioned in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
