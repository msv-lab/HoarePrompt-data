### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The given solution checks this condition in a few steps.

2. **Initial Check**: The function starts by checking if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. This is correct and ensures that if the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' immediately.

3. **Finding a Potential Split Point**: If the array is not initially sorted, the function iterates through possible split points (`i` from 1 to `n-1`). For each split point:
   - It creates a new subarray `new` starting from index `i`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: Ensures that the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the new subarray. This condition is incorrect because it should ensure that the first element of the new subarray is less than or equal to every element in the remaining part of the original array.
     - `new_all`: Ensures that the new subarray itself is sorted in non-decreasing order. This condition is correct.

4. **Validation**: If both conditions are met for any split point, the function prints 'YES'. However, the condition `check_all_new` is incorrectly formulated. It should check if the first element of the new subarray is less than or equal to every element in the remaining part of the original array, not the other way around.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - It correctly identifies potential split points and checks if the resulting array can be sorted.
   - However, the logic for checking the split points and conditions has a critical flaw in `check_all_new`.

6. **Output Format**: The function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The provided code has a logical error in the condition `check_all_new`, which incorrectly checks if the first element of the new subarray is greater than or equal to every element in the remaining part of the original array. This means the function may incorrectly identify arrays as sortable when they are not.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate due to the logical error in the condition `check_all_new`.
