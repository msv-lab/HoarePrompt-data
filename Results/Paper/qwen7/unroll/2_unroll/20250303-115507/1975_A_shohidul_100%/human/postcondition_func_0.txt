The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes a list of `n` positive integers (`a`) and an integer `t`. It checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing or can be split into two segments where the first segment is non-increasing and the second segment is non-decreasing. If any of these conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function returns nothing but prints the result for each test case.
