Functionality: The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing or can be split into two segments where the first segment is non-increasing and the second segment is non-decreasing. If any of these conditions are met, the function outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.
