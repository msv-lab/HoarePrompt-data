Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
2. The program iterates over each test case and checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing.
3. If the array is not non-decreasing, it attempts to find a valid split point where the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing.
4. The logic for checking if the array can be split into two parts where the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing is implemented correctly.
5. The program prints 'YES' if such a split exists and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and matches the requirements specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
