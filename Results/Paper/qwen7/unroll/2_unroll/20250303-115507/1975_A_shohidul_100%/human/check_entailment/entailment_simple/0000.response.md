Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing using `check_all`.
4. If the array is non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'.
5. If the array is not non-decreasing, it attempts to find a valid split point `i` where the subarray from index `i` to the end (`a[i:]`) is non-decreasing and the part before this index (up to `i-1`) is non-increasing relative to the first element of the subarray.
6. If such a split is found, it prints 'YES'.
7. If no such split is found, it prints 'NO'.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the annotated program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement. The conditions for determining if the array can be made non-decreasing through the specified operation are correctly checked.

Correctness: **True**
