Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `tc` and the variable `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `tc` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `tc < t`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. For the loop to execute at least once, `tc` must be less than `t`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, we don't need to change its value because it is already defined.
   - `tc` starts from 0, so we need to ensure that `tc` is less than `t` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `tc` being less than `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `tc` is 0, and `tc` must be less than `t`**
