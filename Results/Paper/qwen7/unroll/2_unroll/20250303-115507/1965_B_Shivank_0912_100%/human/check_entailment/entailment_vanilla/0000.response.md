### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of length at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     - All integers from 1 to `n` except `k` can be represented as a subsequence sum of `a`.

2. **Given Solution Analysis:**
   - The function constructs the sequence `ans` as follows:
     - `i` is determined such that \(2^{i+1} > k\).
     - The sequence starts with `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
     - Additional elements are added from `1 << j` for `j` in the range `[0, 19]` excluding `i`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1: No subsequence sums to `k`:**
     - The sequence includes `k - (1 << i)` and `k + 1`, which ensures that no combination of these elements can sum to `k`. This is because any sum involving `k - (1 << i)` would require `(1 << i)` to reach `k`, but `k + 1` is included, making it impossible to form `k`.
   
   - **Condition 2: All integers from 1 to `n` except `k` can be represented as a subsequence sum:**
     - The sequence includes `1 << j` for `j` in the range `[0, 19]`, which covers a wide range of possible sums.
     - By including `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, it ensures that any integer from `1` to `n` can be formed as a subsequence sum, except `k`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The constructed sequence `ans` meets both conditions for the given constraints.
   - The length of the sequence is at most 25, which satisfies the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
