### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of length at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     - All integers from 1 to `n` except `k` can be represented as a subsequence sum of `a`.

2. **Given Solution Analysis:**
   - The function constructs the sequence `ans` as follows:
     - `i` is determined such that \(2^{i+1} > k\).
     - The sequence starts with `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
     - Additional elements are added from `1 << j` for `j` in the range `[0, 19]` excluding `i`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1: No subsequence sums to `k`:**
     - The sequence includes `k - (1 << i)` and `k + 1`, which ensures that no combination of these elements can sum to `k`. This is because any sum involving `k - (1 << i)` would require `(1 << i)` to reach `k`, but `k + 1` is included, making it impossible to form `k`.
   
   - **Condition 2: All integers from 1 to `n` except `k` can be represented as a subsequence sum:**
     - The sequence includes `1 << j` for `j` in the range `[0, 19]`, which covers a wide range of possible sums.
     - By including `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, it ensures that any integer from `1` to `n` can be formed as a subsequence sum, except `k`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The constructed sequence `ans` meets both conditions for the given constraints.
   - The length of the sequence is at most 25, which satisfies the problem's requirement.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the problem statement, we notice that the sequence construction logic might not cover all cases correctly. Specifically, the sequence construction logic assumes that the sequence will always include `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, which might not guarantee that all integers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

For instance, consider the test case where `n = 8` and `k = 8`. The sequence generated by the provided code would be:
```
[7, 9, 13]
[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]
```
This sequence does not include all integers from 1 to 8 except 8. Specifically, it misses the integers 5, 6, and 7.

To ensure correctness, we need to verify that the sequence generated can indeed represent all integers from 1 to `n` (except `k`). The current implementation does not guarantee this, as it only includes specific powers of 2 and some additional elements.

### Conclusion:
The given solution does not correctly construct a sequence that meets the problem's requirements in all cases.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that all integers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum in all cases.
