### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of length at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     - All integers from 1 to `n` except `k` can be represented as a subsequence sum of `a`.

2. **Given Solution Analysis:**
   - The function constructs the sequence `ans` as follows:
     - `i` is determined such that \(2^{i+1} > k\).
     - The sequence starts with `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
     - Additional elements are added from `1 << j` for `j` in the range `[0, 19]` excluding `i`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1: No subsequence sums to `k`:**
     - The sequence includes `k - (1 << i)` and `k + 1`, which ensures that no combination of these elements can sum to `k`. This is because any sum involving `k - (1 << i)` would require `(1 << i)` to reach `k`, but `k + 1` is included, making it impossible to form `k`.
   
   - **Condition 2: All integers from 1 to `n` except `k` can be represented as a subsequence sum:**
     - The sequence includes `1 << j` for `j` in the range `[0, 19]`, which covers a wide range of possible sums.
     - By including `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, it ensures that any integer from `1` to `n` can be formed as a subsequence sum, except `k`.

4. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the construction of the sequence:
     - The sequence includes `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. These ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` because any combination involving `k - (1 << i)` and `k + 1` cannot form `k`.
     - The sequence also includes all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19`, which allows forming any sum from `1` to `2^20 - 1` (since `2^20` is too large and not needed).

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
- The sequence includes `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, which might not cover all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` for certain values of `n` and `k`.

For example, consider the case where `n = 10` and `k = 5`:
- The sequence constructed might include `[5 - (1 << 2), 5 + 1, 5 + 1 + (1 << 2)] = [1, 6, 11]`.
- Additional elements are `[1, 2, 4, 8]`.
- The sequence becomes `[1, 6, 11, 1, 2, 4, 8]`.
- This sequence does not cover all sums from `1` to `10` except `5`.

Thus, the given solution does not guarantee that all integers from `1` to `n` except `k` can be represented as a subsequence sum.

### Conclusion:
The given solution does not correctly construct a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
