Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`, followed by the array elements.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - It calculates the initial sum of the array `s`.

3. **Finding Maximum Prefix Sum**:
   - It iterates through the array to find the maximum prefix sum `t`. This is done using a variable `tmp` which accumulates the sum of the current prefix. If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to zero. The maximum value of `tmp` during this iteration is stored in `t`.

4. **Calculating the Final Answer**:
   - The initial answer `ans` is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, the maximum prefix sum `t` is doubled and added to `ans`, taking care to apply the modulo operation to keep the result within bounds.

5. **Output**:
   - The final answer is printed for each test case.

This approach ensures that the program correctly computes the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the specified operations. The logic handles both positive and negative sums appropriately and efficiently uses the properties of modular arithmetic to avoid overflow issues.
