Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2⋅10^5) such that the sum of n and k across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5, and an array a of n integers (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function processes the given data and returns a result based on the specified conditions.**

This functionality describes that the function handles multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and an array, and processes them according to the given constraints and requirements without directly accepting these as function parameters.
