### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The initial sum of the array (`s`) is a crucial component.
   - The maximum prefix sum (`t`) of the array also plays a significant role.
   - After the first operation, we can double the maximum prefix sum multiple times.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The code reads the input correctly and calculates the initial sum (`s`).
   - It computes the maximum prefix sum (`t`) using Kadane's algorithm.
   - For each operation, it doubles the maximum prefix sum (`t`), ensuring the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The final sum is calculated as \((s + t) \% (10^9 + 7)\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array has negative values, the maximum prefix sum (`t`) might be zero, which is handled correctly.
   - The doubling of `t` up to `k-1` operations ensures that the maximum possible sum is achieved.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The use of `(s + t) % MOD + MOD` ensures the result is always non-negative, which is necessary since the modulo operation can sometimes yield negative results.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic for calculating the maximum prefix sum and the subsequent doubling of `t` is sound.
   - The handling of the modulo operation is correct and ensures the result fits within the required bounds.

7. **Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:**
   - The initial state correctly initializes `T`, `n`, `k`, and `a`.
   - The computation of `s` as the sum of the array is correct.
   - The computation of `t` as the maximum prefix sum using Kadane's algorithm is correct.
   - The doubling of `t` in each iteration is done correctly, ensuring the result remains within the modulo bounds.
   - The final sum calculation is correct and handles the modulo operation appropriately.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations. The code handles edge cases and performs the required operations accurately.
