Output State: **`T` is an integer read from standard input and stripped of whitespace, and 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `MOD` is 1000000007.**

The code reads an integer from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to `T`. The value of `T` is constrained to be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and `MOD` remains unchanged at 1000000007.
