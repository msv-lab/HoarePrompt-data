The function accepts a dictionary `nodes` representing a graph where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors (excluding the parent node if provided), an integer `start` representing the starting node, and an optional integer `parent` representing the parent node of the current node (default is None). It returns `False` if the starting node has only one neighbor which is the parent, otherwise it recursively checks the neighbors of the starting node and returns `True` if any of them satisfy a certain condition, otherwise it returns `False`.
