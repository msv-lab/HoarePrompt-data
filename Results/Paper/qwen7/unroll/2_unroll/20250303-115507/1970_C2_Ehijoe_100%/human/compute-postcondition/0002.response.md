Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**

The variable `empty` is set to `True`, indicating that initially, the list `edges` was considered empty. No other changes are made to the variables `t`, `n`, or `edges`. Therefore, their initial states remain unchanged.
