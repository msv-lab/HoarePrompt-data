Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.
   - It also contains the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values and Conditions:**
   - `t` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `edges` is an empty list.
   - `empty` is True.
   - `nodes` is a defaultdict where all keys initially point to an empty list.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `range(n - 1)`, which means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - For the loop to execute, the loop condition must be satisfied, i.e., `n - 1` must be a non-negative integer.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 (since `n - 1` should be a valid non-negative integer).

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 so that the loop can execute.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0 because the loop starts from `i = 0`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
