Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers from 0 to n-1, and each key points to a list containing its adjacent nodes based on user input, `leaves` is an empty deque.**

Explanation: The line `leaves = deque()` creates a new deque object named `leaves` and assigns it to the variable `leaves`. This deque is initially empty. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
