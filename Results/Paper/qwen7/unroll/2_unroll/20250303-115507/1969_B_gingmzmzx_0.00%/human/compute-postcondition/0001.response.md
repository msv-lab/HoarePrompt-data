Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder for the loop index) and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and doesn't hold any specific value; it is used as a loop counter.
   - The variable `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `_` doesn't need adjustment because it is just a loop counter and its initial value is not relevant to the loop's execution condition.

5. **State the final state before the loop**: Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `n` is an input integer, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
