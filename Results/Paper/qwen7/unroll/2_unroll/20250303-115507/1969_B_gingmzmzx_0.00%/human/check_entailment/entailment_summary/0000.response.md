Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the input as a list of integers instead of a string. This means that it will not handle the actual binary string correctly.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Calculation**: The logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string is flawed. The current implementation does not account for the cyclic shifts and their costs properly. It simply counts zeros and ones without considering the positions and required shifts.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
- Read the input as a string.
- Identify the longest prefix that is already sorted.
- Calculate the cost of performing cyclic shifts to sort the remaining part of the string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = input().strip()
        # Find the longest prefix that is already sorted
        i = 0
        while i < len(s) - 1 and s[i] <= s[i + 1]:
            i += 1
        
        # If the entire string is sorted, no cost needed
        if i == len(s) - 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the cost to sort the rest of the string
        cost = 0
        start = i + 1
        end = len(s) - 1
        while start < end:
            cost += end - start + 1
            end -= 1
        
        print(cost)

# Example usage
func_1()
```

This corrected program should correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

Correctness: **False**
