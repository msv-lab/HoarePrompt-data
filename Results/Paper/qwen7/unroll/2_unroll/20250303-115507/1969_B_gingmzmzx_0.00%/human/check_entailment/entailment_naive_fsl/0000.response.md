Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The provided solution seems to be attempting to count something related to the number of zeros and ones in the string but does not implement the logic for calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.

For example, consider the input string `101011`. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would involve multiple cyclic shifts to sort the string, resulting in a total cost of 9. However, the provided function does not implement this logic and instead counts something unrelated, leading to incorrect results.
