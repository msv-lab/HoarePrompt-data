Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a binary string such that 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and s_i ∈ {0, 1}. It returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**
