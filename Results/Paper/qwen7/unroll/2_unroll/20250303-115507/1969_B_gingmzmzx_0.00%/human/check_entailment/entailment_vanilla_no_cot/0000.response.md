Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires performing cyclic shifts on substrings to sort the binary string in non-descending order, and the cost is based on the length of the substring. However, the function `func_1` does not implement any logic for cyclic shifts or calculating the minimum cost as described. Instead, it seems to be counting something related to the counts of zeros and ones but does not address the core requirement of sorting through cyclic shifts.
