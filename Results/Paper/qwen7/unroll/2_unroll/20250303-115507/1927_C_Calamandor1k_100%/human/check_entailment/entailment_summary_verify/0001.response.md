### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, array `a`, and array `b`.

2. **Creating Sets of Unique Elements:**
   - For each test case, it creates sets of unique elements from `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - This step is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

3. **Calculating Exclusive and Common Elements:**
   - It then calculates the number of elements that are exclusive to `a` (`only_a`), exclusive to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).
   - This calculation is done correctly using set operations.

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the number of elements exclusive to `a` or `b` exceeds `k // 2`. If so, it immediately appends 'NO' to the results and moves to the next test case.
   - This condition check is correct and ensures that no more than half of the required elements can come from either array alone.
   - It then checks if the total number of distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is at least `k`. If not, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - This condition check is also correct and ensures that there are enough distinct elements to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.

5. **Appending Results:**
   - If neither of the above conditions fail, it appends 'YES' to the results.
   - This is the correct approach to ensure that all numbers from 1 to `k` can be included among the chosen elements from both arrays.

6. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and returns the results in a list.
   - The logic in the function correctly follows the problem statement and ensures that all numbers from 1 to `k` can be included among the chosen elements from both arrays.

### Evaluation:

- The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
- It handles the conditions specified in the problem accurately.
- The function `func_1` processes each test case and returns the correct results.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
