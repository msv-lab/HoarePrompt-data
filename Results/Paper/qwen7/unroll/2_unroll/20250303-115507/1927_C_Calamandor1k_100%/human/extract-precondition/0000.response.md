Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers n, m, and k such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), and k is even. Additionally, the lists a and b in each test case contain integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6, and the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.**
