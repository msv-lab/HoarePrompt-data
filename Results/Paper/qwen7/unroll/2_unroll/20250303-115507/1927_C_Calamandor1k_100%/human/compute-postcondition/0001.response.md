Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop iterates over `cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains five elements: `(n, m, k, a, b)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `cases`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` along with two lists `a` and `b`.

3. **Conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `cases`.
   - Each element in `cases` must satisfy the conditions: \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot \min(n, m)\), and \(k\) is even.
   - The lists `a` and `b` must contain integers such that \(1 \leq a_i, b_j \leq 10^6\).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `results` is an empty list, it doesn't affect the loop execution directly.
   - `t` is a positive integer within a specific range but does not affect the loop itself.
   - `cases` must be non-empty for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `cases` to ensure it is non-empty and contains valid tuples.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains integers n, m, k, a, b that satisfy the given constraints**.
