Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` strings `s`. If all characters in any string `s` are the same, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest and largest permutations of `s` based on the original string's order. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
