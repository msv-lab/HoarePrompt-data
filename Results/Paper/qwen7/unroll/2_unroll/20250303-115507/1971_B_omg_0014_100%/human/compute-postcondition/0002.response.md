Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses based on whether the string `s` has a unique character or not for each iteration of the loop. If the length of the set `a` is 1 (indicating all characters in `s` are the same), it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will print 'YES', followed by either the lexicographically sorted string or its reverse, depending on which comes first alphabetically.

For example, if `n` is 3 and the inputs for `s` are "hello", "aaa", and "abc", the output would be:

```
YES
NO
YES
cba
```
