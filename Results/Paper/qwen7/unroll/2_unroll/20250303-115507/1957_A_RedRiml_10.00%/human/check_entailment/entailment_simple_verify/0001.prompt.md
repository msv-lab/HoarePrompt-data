You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):

        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks.
   - Each polygon must have all sides equal (i.e., regular), and no stick can be used more than once.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and their lengths stored in `palka`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is created to store unique stick lengths.
   - The variable `shapes` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the number of polygons that can be formed.
   - For each unique stick length in `pl`, if its count in `d` is at least 3, it increments `shapes`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly counts the occurrences of each stick length.
   - However, the code does not ensure that the number of sticks for each polygon is sufficient to form a polygon with at least 3 sides.
   - The code simply checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length without considering the total number of such sticks available.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     4
     1
     1
     2
     1 1
     6
     2 2 3 3 3 3
     9
     4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
     ```
   - The output should be:
     ```
     0
     0
     1
     2
     ```
   - The current implementation will output:
     ```
     0
     0
     1
     1
     ```
   - This is incorrect because in the last test case, we can form 2 polygons (one with side length 2 and another with side length 4).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The code does not correctly calculate the maximum number of polygons that can be formed simultaneously.
   - It only checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length without ensuring that the total number of such sticks is sufficient to form multiple polygons.
