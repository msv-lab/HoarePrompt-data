Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed. Specifically, the program counts the number of sides available for each unique stick length but does not consider the requirement that each polygon must have at least 3 sides. For example, in the fourth test case where the input is `9\n4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`, the program outputs `2` because it counts the number of unique stick lengths (`4` and `2`) that have at least 3 sticks. However, the correct answer should be `2` because we can form one triangle (with sides of length 4) and one square (with sides of length 2), but the program does not account for this properly.
