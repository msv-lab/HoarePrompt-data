Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, w is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `w` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The variable `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, `t` retains its initial condition of being an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
