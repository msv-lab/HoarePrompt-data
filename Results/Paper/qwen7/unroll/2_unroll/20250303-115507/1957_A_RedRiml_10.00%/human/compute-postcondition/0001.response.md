Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(w):`. The variables involved here are `_` (a dummy variable) and `w`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: From the given information, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), and `w` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `w` is a positive integer. If `w` is zero or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the value of `w`, we need to ensure that `w` is a positive integer. The initial state of `t` does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `w` being a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`w` must be a positive integer**
