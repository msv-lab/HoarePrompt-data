You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n consisting of only "U" and "D".
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is 4, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n consisting of only "U" and "D", `results` is a list where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the count of 'U' in `s` is odd or even for each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: index



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The function `func_1` reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read`, which is a common approach for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Parsing Data**: It then splits the input into a list of strings and iterates over the test cases.
3. **Counting Facing-Up Coins**: For each test case, it counts the number of coins facing up (`num_up_coins`).
4. **Determining Winner**: The logic to determine the winner is based on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even:
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob wins.
5. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed out.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly identifies that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win because she can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, forcing Bob to eventually face a situation where there are no more facing-up coins.
- Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice will eventually face a situation with no more facing-up coins.

Given this analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial number of facing-up coins.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct according to the problem description.
