Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`.
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.
   - The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: 
   - Since the loop runs `t` times, the value of `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The loop body is omitted, but the loop itself requires `t` to be a non-negative integer (since `range(t)` will not produce any iterations if `t` is negative).

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - The state of `index` is irrelevant to the loop's execution.
   - The state of `t` must be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Since `t` must be at least 1, we set `t` to be greater than or equal to 1.
   - The states of `n`, `s`, and `results` are not directly involved in the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
