### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The function `func_1` reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read`, which is a common approach for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Parsing Data**: It then splits the input into a list of strings and iterates over the test cases.
3. **Counting Facing-Up Coins**: For each test case, it counts the number of coins facing up (`num_up_coins`).
4. **Determining Winner**: The logic to determine the winner is based on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even:
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob wins.
5. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed out.

### Analysis:

- The logic correctly identifies that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win because she can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, forcing Bob to eventually face a situation where there are no more facing-up coins.
- Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice will eventually face a situation with no more facing-up coins.

However, the provided code has a critical flaw in its logic. The problem description states that the game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the winner is determined based on the parity of the initial number of facing-up coins. The code does not simulate the actual game process but instead makes a decision based solely on the initial count of facing-up coins. This is a simplification that works under the assumption that the game can be decided purely by the initial state, which is not entirely accurate.

### Example Counter-Example:

Consider the following test case:
```
3
5
UUDUD
5
UDDUD
2
UU
```

- For the first test case (`UUDUD`), the initial count of facing-up coins is 3 (odd), so the code correctly outputs "YES".
- For the second test case (`UDDUD`), the initial count of facing-up coins is 2 (even), so the code correctly outputs "NO".
- For the third test case (`UU`), the initial count of facing-up coins is 2 (even), so the code incorrectly outputs "NO".

However, let's simulate the game for the third test case:
- Alice picks the first coin: `DD`.
- Bob picks the second coin: `U`.
- Alice picks the first coin: `UU`.

At this point, the game ends with two coins facing up, and since there are no more moves, Alice wins. Therefore, the correct output should be "YES".

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly simulate the game and instead makes a decision based on the initial count of facing-up coins without considering the actual game dynamics. This leads to incorrect results in some cases.

**Final: False**
