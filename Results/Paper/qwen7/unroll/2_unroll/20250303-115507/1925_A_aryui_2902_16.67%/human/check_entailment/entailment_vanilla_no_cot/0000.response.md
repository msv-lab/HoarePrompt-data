Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly address the problem statement. The function `func_1` generates a string `s` by repeating the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` exactly `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. 

For example, for the input `2 2`, the output should be `baab` or `abab`, but the provided solution would output a string like `aabb` or `baba`, which does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 2 lowercase letters (`aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`). 

A correct solution would need to construct the shortest string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
