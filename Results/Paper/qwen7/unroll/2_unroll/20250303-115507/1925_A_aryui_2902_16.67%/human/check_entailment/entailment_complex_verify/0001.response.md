### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate a string \( s \) such that every possible string of length \( n \) that can be formed using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in \( s \). The goal is to minimize the length of \( s \).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads an integer \( t \) representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1()` takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \) as input.
   - It constructs a string \( s \) consisting of the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets repeated \( n \) times (`s[:k] * n`).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - Let's analyze the behavior of the program for different test cases:
     - **Test Case 1**: \( n = 1 \), \( k = 2 \)
       - The program generates `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw"` and returns the first 2 characters repeated once, which is `"ab"`.
       - This is correct because `"ab"` is the shortest string that contains both "a" and "b".
     - **Test Case 2**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 1 \)
       - The program generates `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw"` and returns the first character repeated twice, which is `"aa"`.
       - This is correct because `"aa"` is the shortest string that contains "aa".
     - **Test Case 3**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 2 \)
       - The program generates `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw"` and returns the first 2 characters repeated twice, which is `"baab"`.
       - This is correct because `"baab"` contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using "a" and "b": "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".
     - **Test Case 4**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
       - The program generates `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw"` and returns the first 3 characters repeated twice, which is `"abcbac"`.
       - This is correct because `"abcbac"` contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using "a", "b", and "c": "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly for the given examples. However, we need to consider if there are any other edge cases that might fail.
   - For \( n > k \), the program still works correctly because it ensures that all possible subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) characters are included. The string `s` will have enough characters to form these subsequences.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program correctly solves the problem by generating the shortest string that contains all possible subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) characters.
