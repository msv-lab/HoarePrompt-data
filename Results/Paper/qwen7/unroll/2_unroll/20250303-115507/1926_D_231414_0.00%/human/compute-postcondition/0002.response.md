State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop uses `range(times)` to determine its number of iterations.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the loop, typically representing the current iteration index. It starts at 0 when the loop begins.
- For the loop to execute, `times` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
- The initial value of `_` is 0 because the loop has not yet started iterating.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `times` (it must be greater than 0) and `_` (it is 0).
