Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (size of the list), and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then iterates through the list, using bitwise XOR operations to count unique elements. The function prints the count of unique elements for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final value of `check` (which is always set to \( 2^{31} - 1 \)) and `times` (which is reduced to 0 after all iterations).**
