You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the list of integers a contains n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^{31} for all 1 ≤ j ≤ n; the sum of all n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    times = int(input())
    check = 2 ** 31 - 1
    for _ in range(times):
        n = int(input())
        
        data = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        dic = dict()
        
        ans = n
        
        check = 2 ** 31 - 1
        
        for i in data:
            s = i ^ check
            if s in dic:
                dic[s] -= 1
                ans -= 1
                if dic[s] == 0:
                    del dic[s]
            elif i in dic:
                dic[i] += 1
            else:
                dic[i] = 1
            print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: `check` is 2147483647, `times` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs `times` number of times, and each iteration updates the `check` variable to `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is 2147483647. After all iterations, `times` will be reduced to 0 because it decreases by 1 in each iteration. The `check` variable remains unchanged as it is reset to 2147483647 at the start of each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and a list of n non-negative integers a (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ n). The function returns a result based on the input for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
