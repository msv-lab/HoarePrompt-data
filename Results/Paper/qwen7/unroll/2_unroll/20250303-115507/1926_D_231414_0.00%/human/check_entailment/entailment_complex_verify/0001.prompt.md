You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

    #State: Output State: `check` is 2147483647, `times` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs `times` number of times, and each iteration updates the `check` variable to `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is 2147483647. After all iterations, `times` will be reduced to 0 because it decreases by 1 in each iteration. The `check` variable remains unchanged as it is reset to 2147483647 at the start of each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (size of the list), and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then iterates through the list, using bitwise XOR operations to count unique elements. The function prints the count of unique elements for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final value of `check` (which is always set to \( 2^{31} - 1 \)) and `times` (which is reduced to 0 after all iterations).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires dividing numbers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value at any position from 1 to 31 in their binary representation.

2. **Key Insight**: Two numbers can be in the same group if and only if their bitwise XOR with `2^31 - 1` (which flips all bits) results in different values. This is because flipping all bits ensures that if two numbers have the same bit pattern in the lower 31 bits, their XOR will be different.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program initializes `times` which is the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `data`.
   - A dictionary `dic` is used to keep track of the counts of the flipped values (`s = i ^ check`).
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, representing the initial count of groups needed.
   - For each number `i` in `data`, it calculates `s = i ^ check`.
     - If `s` is already in `dic`, it means there's another number in the same group, so it decrements `ans` and removes `s` from `dic`.
     - If `i` is already in `dic`, it increments the count for `i`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `i` to `dic` with a count of 1.
   - After processing all numbers, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for determining whether two numbers can be in the same group is correct.
   - The use of XOR with `2^31 - 1` correctly identifies pairs of numbers that can be in the same group.
   - The decrementing and counting mechanism in the dictionary correctly tracks the number of groups needed.
   - However, the program prints `ans` after processing each number in the current test case, which is incorrect. It should print the final value of `ans` after processing all numbers in a test case.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic of the program is fundamentally correct, but it prints the result prematurely within the loop over the numbers in the test case. It should print the result after processing all numbers in the test case.
