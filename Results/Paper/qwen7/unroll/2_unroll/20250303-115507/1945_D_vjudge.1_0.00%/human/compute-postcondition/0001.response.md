Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains `_` and `numero_testes`. The variable `_` is a common placeholder used when the loop variable is not needed within the loop body. The important variable here is `numero_testes`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `numero_testes`**: According to the given information, `numero_testes` is an integer where \(1 \leq numero_testes \leq 10^4\). We also know that `numero_testes` is set by reading an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `numero_testes` is greater than 0. Since `numero_testes` is initialized to a positive integer (as per the given constraints), the loop will always execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: The only variable that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `numero_testes`. It should be ensured that `numero_testes` is greater than 0, which is already guaranteed by the given constraints.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`numero_testes` must be greater than 0**.
