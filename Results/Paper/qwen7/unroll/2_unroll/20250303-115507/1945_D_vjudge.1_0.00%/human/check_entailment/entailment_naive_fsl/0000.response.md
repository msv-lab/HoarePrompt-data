Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not handle the logic of exchanging positions and accumulating the minimum cost correctly.

Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Reverse Lists**: The code reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`. This is incorrect because the problem states that the positions in the queue are from 1 to n, and Kirill wants to move to a position within the first m people. Reversing the lists would incorrectly interpret the positions.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation logic in the loops is flawed. The variable `pref` is used to accumulate costs, but it is not correctly updated to reflect the cost of moving Kirill to the desired position. Additionally, the logic for updating `soma_b` and calculating the minimum cost is not aligned with the problem statement.

Here is a corrected approach:

1. Iterate through the queue from the end to the beginning.
2. Keep track of the cumulative cost of moving Kirill to the desired position.
3. Ensure that the cost is calculated correctly for each position.

A corrected version of the solution might look like this:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the minimum cost to infinity
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate from the end of the queue to the beginning
    for i in range(n - 1, m - 1, -1):
        current_cost = 0
        for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
            current_cost += lista_B[j]
            if j > 0:
                current_cost += lista_B[j - 1]
            if current_cost + lista_A[j] < min_cost:
                min_cost = current_cost + lista_A[j]
    
    print(min_cost)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

# Call the function to process the input
func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the cost is calculated correctly and that Kirill moves to the desired position with the minimum cost.
