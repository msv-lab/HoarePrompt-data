Output State: `soma_b` is the sum of `soma_b` and `lista_B[i]` for each index `i` from `n - k` to `n-1`, `pref` remains the same as its initial value, `resultado` is the minimum value between `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for each index `i` from `n - k` to `n-1`, and `soma_b` is updated by adding `lista_B[i]` to itself for each index `i` from `n - k` to `n-1`.
