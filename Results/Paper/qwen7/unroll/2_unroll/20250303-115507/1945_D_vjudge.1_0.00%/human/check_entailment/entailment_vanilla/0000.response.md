### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a queue where Kirill needs to move to one of the first `m` positions by swapping places with other people.
   - Each swap incurs costs: `a_i` for swapping with the person directly in front, and `b_i` for each person between them.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes the necessary variables (`n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `soma_b`, `pref`).
   - It reverses both lists, which is unnecessary since the problem doesn't specify the order of processing.
   - The main loop iterates from `n-k` to `n-1` to ensure Kirill ends up in one of the first `m` positions.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if swapping with the current person is cheaper than accumulating the cost from `b_i`.
   - It maintains a running total of the accumulated cost (`soma_b`) and updates the prefix sum (`pref`).

3. **Analyzing the Final Cost Calculation:**
   - After the loop, it calculates the minimum cost by considering the accumulated cost plus the cost of the last swap (`lista_A[i]`).

4. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each one sequentially.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases like when `k` is equal to `n` (Kirill is already in the first `m` positions).
   - It also handles the case where `k` is 1 (Kirill needs to be in the first position).

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case.
   - The reversal of lists is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness.
   - The overall structure and logic of the functions are sound and align with the problem requirements.
