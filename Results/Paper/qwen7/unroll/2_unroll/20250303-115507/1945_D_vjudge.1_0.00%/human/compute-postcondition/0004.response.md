Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts integers `numero_testes`, `n`, and `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a list `b` of `n` integers. It returns a result based on the comparison and processing of these inputs.**

Note: The function processes a series of test cases where each test case includes specific parameters and lists, and it returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.
