Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array, not simply to print the count of the current median.
- The program sorts the array and then counts the occurrences of the middle element (median). This is not the correct approach because the problem requires increasing the median, which means we need to find out how many operations are needed to make the median larger than its current value.
- The program does not perform any operations to modify the elements of the array; it only counts the occurrences of the current median. Therefore, it fails to address the core requirement of minimizing the number of operations to increase the median.

Correctness: **False**
