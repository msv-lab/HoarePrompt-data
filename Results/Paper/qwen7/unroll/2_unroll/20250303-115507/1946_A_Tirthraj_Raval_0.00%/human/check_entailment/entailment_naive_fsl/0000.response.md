Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of the element at the median position in the sorted array. This approach is incorrect because:

- The goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to make the current median value greater than its current value, not just count how many elements are equal to the current median.
- The program does not consider the possibility of increasing elements to achieve a higher median value.

For example, consider the array `[2, 2, 8]`. The median is `2`, and the program would output `1` because there are two `2`s, but the correct answer should be `1` operation to change one `2` to `3`, making the new median `3`.

Another example is the array `[7, 3, 3, 1]`. The median is `3`, and the program would output `2` because there are two `3`s, but the correct answer should be `2` operations to change both `3`s to `4`, making the new median `4`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
