Output State: **`costs` is a list of results from applying `func_1(row, d)` to each row in `rows`, where each result is a positive integer representing the cost calculated for each row.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `costs` by applying the function `func_1(row, d)` to each element `row` in the list `rows`. Each `row` is a list of `m` positive integers, and the function `func_1` returns a cost for each row. The original list `rows` remains unchanged, and the new list `costs` contains the results of these function applications.
