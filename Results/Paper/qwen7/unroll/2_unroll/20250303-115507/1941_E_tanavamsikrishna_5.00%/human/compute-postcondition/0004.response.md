Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts. Therefore, we need to set `i` to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. This means that the loop will execute if `i` is within this range.

4. **Initial State of `costs` and `k`**: The initial state of `costs` is a list of positive integers, and `k` is an integer. We don't have specific values for `costs` or `k`, but we know that the length of `costs` minus `(k - 1)` should be a non-negative number for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be 0, and `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, we can conclude the following:

- `i` must be 0.
- `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, `costs` is a list of positive integers, `i` is 0, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0**
