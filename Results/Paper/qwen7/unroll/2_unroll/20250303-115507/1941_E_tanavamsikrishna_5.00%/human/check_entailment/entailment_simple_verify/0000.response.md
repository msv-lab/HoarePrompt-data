### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of the river.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial Update**: 
   ```python
   for i in range(0, d - 1):
       row[i] = row[i] + 1
   ```
   This loop increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1. This part is correct because it ensures that the first `d-1` supports are installed.

2. **Main Update Loop**:
   ```python
   for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
       row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
   ```
   This loop updates the remaining elements of the row. The logic here is to set the cost of the current cell to the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus 1. This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, there is a potential issue with how the minimum value is being calculated.

   - **Issue**: The condition `i > 0` is used to handle the edge case where `i = 0`. When `i = 0`, the slice `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]` becomes `row[0:0]`, which is an empty slice. This results in `min([])` returning `0`, which is incorrect because the first element should still be incremented by 1. This means the first element is not correctly handled.

   - **Corrected Logic**: To fix this, we should explicitly handle the case when `i = 0` separately:
     ```python
     if i == 0:
         row[i] = row[i] + 1
     else:
         row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) + 1) + row[i]
     ```

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   ```python
   n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
   rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
   ```
   This part reads the input correctly.

2. **Calculating Costs**:
   ```python
   costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
   ```
   This line calls `func_1` for each row and stores the result in `costs`.

3. **Summing Costs for Consecutive Rows**:
   ```python
   total_costs = []
   for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
       total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
   ```
   This loop calculates the sum of costs for each consecutive `k` rows and stores these sums in `total_costs`.

4. **Finding Minimum Total Cost**:
   ```python
   print(min(total_costs))
   ```
   This prints the minimum total cost.

### Conclusion:
The main issue lies in the `func_1` function where the handling of the first element in the row is incorrect. The corrected logic should explicitly handle the case when `i = 0` separately. Given this, the original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost due to the issue in `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the issue in `func_1` where the first element is not correctly handled.
