The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d`. It updates the list `row` by incrementing each element from index \(d-1\) to the last index by 1 plus the minimum value among the previous \(d\) elements (including itself if applicable). The function returns the last element of the updated list `row`.
