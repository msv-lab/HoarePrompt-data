### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges over consecutive rows in a river grid.
   - Each row can have supports installed with a cost calculated using `func_1`.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates the cost of installing supports in a single row.
   - It initializes the first support cost to `row[0] + 1`.
   - For subsequent cells, it finds the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells and adds `1` to it.
   - This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It constructs the grid `rows` from the input.
   - It uses `func_1` to calculate the cost for each row and stores these costs in `costs`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the cost for a single row.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows and finds the minimum cost.

However, there is a subtle issue with the implementation of `func_1` that needs to be addressed:

- In the second loop of `func_1`, the formula used to update the row values is:
  ```python
  row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
  ```
  This formula aims to ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, the formula should be:
  ```python
  row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - d):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
  ```

  The current implementation considers the previous `d + 1` elements instead of the previous `d` elements. This could lead to incorrect results because it might include an unnecessary extra element in the minimum calculation.

To fix this, we need to change the range in the `min` function to `max(0, i - d):i`.

### Corrected Implementation of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(row, d):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - d):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
    return row[-1]
```

With this correction, the function will correctly ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the overall structure and logic of the solution, but it missed the detail in the implementation of `func_1`. The corrected implementation should be used to ensure the solution works as intended.

### Final:
Final: **False**
