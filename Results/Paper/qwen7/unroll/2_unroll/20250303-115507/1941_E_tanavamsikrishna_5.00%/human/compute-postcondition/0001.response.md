Output State: **`rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` lines of input, each containing `m` space-separated integers, and constructs a list of lists (`rows`) from these inputs. Each inner list (representing a row in the river) contains `m` positive integers, with the first and last elements being 0, as specified in the initial state. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged and are not directly used in the construction of `rows`.
