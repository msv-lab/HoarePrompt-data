You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the last time conversion in the loop, `n` is the number of times the loop has executed.
    #
    #After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The `day` will be determined by the last time conversion operation inside the loop, which depends on the last input time (`h`, `m`). If the last `h` is 0, `day` will be 'AM'; if `h` is greater than 12, `day` will be 'PM'; otherwise, `day` will be 'AM'. The variable `n` will be equal to the number of times the loop has executed, which is provided as input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time. It returns "valid" if the time represented by `s` corresponds to the integer `t` within a specific context (such as the number of minutes since midnight), otherwise it returns "invalid".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
