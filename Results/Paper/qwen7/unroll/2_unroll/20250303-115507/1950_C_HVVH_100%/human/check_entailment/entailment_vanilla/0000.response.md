### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Time Conversion Logic**:
   - For hours equal to 0, it correctly converts them to 12 and sets the day to "AM".
   - For hours greater than 12, it correctly subtracts 12 to convert to the 12-hour format and sets the day to "PM".
   - For hours between 1 and 11, it correctly sets the day to "AM" or "PM" based on whether the hour is 12.
3. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the time in the correct 12-hour format with leading zeros where necessary and includes the correct AM/PM indicator.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The hour 0 is correctly converted to 12:00 AM.
   - The hour 12 is correctly converted to 12:00 PM.
   - Hours between 1 and 11 are correctly handled and printed in the correct AM/PM format.
5. **Consistency**: The logic is consistent throughout the program, and there are no apparent errors in handling the input or converting the time.

Given that the program correctly handles all the specified conditions and edge cases, it appears to be correct.

### Correctness: **True**
