Functionality: **The function processes multiple time inputs in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to a 12-hour clock format with AM/PM notation. It prints each converted time. The function does not return any value but modifies the `day` variable to reflect the last converted time's AM/PM status and keeps track of the number of inputs processed through the `n` variable. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not used within the function.**
