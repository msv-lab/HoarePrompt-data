Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the last time conversion in the loop, `n` is the number of times the loop has executed.

After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The `day` will be determined by the last time conversion operation inside the loop, which depends on the last input time (`h`, `m`). If the last `h` is 0, `day` will be 'AM'; if `h` is greater than 12, `day` will be 'PM'; otherwise, `day` will be 'AM'. The variable `n` will be equal to the number of times the loop has executed, which is provided as input.
