Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- It properly adjusts the hour values:
  - Hours from 00 to 11 remain the same and are marked as 'AM'.
  - Hours from 13 to 23 are adjusted by subtracting 12 and marked as 'PM'.
- The code uses `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` to ensure that both the hour and minute are formatted with leading zeros if necessary.
- The `day` variable is correctly updated after each conversion, although it is not necessary for the final output since the output is independent of the previous conversions.
- The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, printing the result for each one.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
