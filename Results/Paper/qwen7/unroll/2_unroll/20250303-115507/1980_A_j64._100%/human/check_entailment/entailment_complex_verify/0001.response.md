### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the string `a` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - The function initializes an array `count` of size 7 to zero, which will store the count of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - **Counting Problems:**
     - It iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `count` for each character.
   - **Calculating Needed Problems:**
     - It then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level by checking if the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`. If it is, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.
   - **Return Statement:**
     - Finally, it returns `needed_problems`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The function correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `a`.
   - It then determines the shortfall for each difficulty level and sums these shortfalls to get the total number of additional problems needed.
   - The logic ensures that the program outputs the minimum number of additional problems required to meet the requirement of having at least `m` problems of each difficulty level.

4. **Test Cases:**
   - The provided examples are correctly handled by the program:
     - For the input `10 1 BGECDCBDED`, the output is `2` because there are only 1 problem of difficulty 'A' and 1 problem of difficulty 'F', and Vlad needs to create 1 problem of 'A' and 1 problem of 'F'.
     - For the input `10 2 BGECDCBDED`, the output is `5` because there are only 1 problem of difficulty 'A' and 1 problem of difficulty 'F', and Vlad needs to create 1 problem of 'A' and 1 problem of 'F' for each of the 2 rounds.
     - For the input `9 1 BBCDEFFGG`, the output is `1` because there is only 1 problem of difficulty 'A', and Vlad needs to create 1 problem of 'A'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can conduct `m` rounds with at least one problem of each required difficulty level.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate.
