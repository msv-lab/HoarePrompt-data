Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The program reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading a string of length 5.
3. For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
4. It compares the counts and prints 'A' if there are more 'A's, otherwise it prints 'B'.

Given the constraints and the example provided in the execution summary, the program behaves as expected. It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the appropriate character ('A' or 'B') for each string based on the frequency count.

Correctness: **True**
