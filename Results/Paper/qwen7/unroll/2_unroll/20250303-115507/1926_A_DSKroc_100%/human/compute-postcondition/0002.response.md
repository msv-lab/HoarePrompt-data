Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'A' or 'B' printed based on the majority count of 'A' or 'B' in each input string of length 5. For each input string, if there are more 'A's than 'B's, 'A' is printed; otherwise, 'B' is printed. The number of 'A's and 'B's printed is equal to the number of input strings provided, which is determined by the initial value of `t`.
