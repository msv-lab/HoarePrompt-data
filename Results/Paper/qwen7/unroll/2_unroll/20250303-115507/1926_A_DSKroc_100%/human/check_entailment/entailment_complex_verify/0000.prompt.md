You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings across all test cases are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each line containing either 'A' or 'B'. For each input string `s` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B', if the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's, the corresponding line contains 'A'; otherwise, it contains 'B'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` strings, each of length 5 consisting of characters 'A' and 'B'. For each string, it counts the number of 'A's and 'B's. If the count of 'A's is greater than the count of 'B's, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all strings, it outputs `t` lines, each containing either 'A' or 'B' based on the comparison.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly. Since the string length is fixed at 5, and the characters are only 'A' or 'B', the logic to count and compare the frequencies works as intended. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the problem description.
