You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The output state will consist of multiple pairs of lists printed for each iteration of the outer loop. For each iteration, two lists `ans1` and `ans2` are formed based on the sorted segments `b` and `c` of the input array `a`. The first list `ans1` contains elements from the first segment of `a` (excluding the last element if it's equal to its predecessor), and the second list `ans2` contains elements from the second segment of `a`. Each list is constructed by pairing adjacent equal elements and then filling with unique elements from both segments until `k` (doubled within the loop) is exhausted or the segments are fully processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Splitting the Array**: The array `a` is split into two halves `b` and `c`, where `b` contains the first `n` elements and `c` contains the last `n` elements. This is done correctly.

3. **Sorting Halves**: Both halves `b` and `c` are sorted. Sorting is necessary to ensure that elements with the same value are adjacent, which helps in forming subsets with equal XOR values.

4. **Forming Subsets `l` and `r`**:
   - **Initial Elements**: The code checks for initial and final elements of `b` and `c` to form the initial part of `l` and `r`. This ensures that if the first or last element appears only once, it is included in the result.
   - **Matching Elements**: The code then iterates through the sorted arrays `b` and `c` to match pairs of elements. If an element in `b` matches its next element, it is added to both `l` and `r`. If an element in `c` matches its previous element, it is added to both `l` and `r`.
   - **Remaining Elements**: Any remaining elements from `b` are added to `l` and `r` alternately to ensure the required length of `2k`.

5. **Output**: The function prints the resulting arrays `l` and `r` for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases where elements appear only once or where the required length `2k` cannot be fully satisfied due to the constraints of the problem.

Given the above analysis, the provided code seems to follow the problem's requirements correctly and should work for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.
