### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Splitting the Array**: The array `a` is split into two halves `b` and `c`, where `b` contains the first `n` elements and `c` contains the last `n` elements. This is done correctly.

3. **Sorting Halves**: Both halves `b` and `c` are sorted. Sorting is necessary to ensure that elements with the same value are adjacent, which helps in forming subsets with equal XOR values.

4. **Forming Subsets `l` and `r`**:
   - **Initial Elements**: The code checks for initial and final elements of `b` and `c` to form the initial part of `l` and `r`. This ensures that if the first or last element appears only once, it is included in the result.
   - **Matching Elements**: The code then iterates through the sorted arrays `b` and `c` to match pairs of elements. If an element in `b` matches its next element, it is added to both `l` and `r`. If an element in `c` matches its previous element, it is added to both `l` and `r`.
   - **Remaining Elements**: Any remaining elements from `b` are added to `l` and `r` alternately to ensure the required length of `2k`.

5. **Output**: The function prints the resulting arrays `l` and `r` for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases where elements appear only once or where the required length `2k` cannot be fully satisfied due to the constraints of the problem.

Given the above analysis, the provided code seems to follow the problem's requirements correctly and should work for the given constraints.
