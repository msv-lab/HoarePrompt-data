Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the optimal play strategy. The program checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even and prints "Bob" if it is, otherwise it prints "Alice". This logic is incorrect because the actual winning condition depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the initial values of `a` and `b`.

To determine the correct winner, we need to consider the following:
- If `a` and `b` are both odd or both even, the player whose turn it is will eventually lose because they will always be forced to make the other player's wallet even or odd, leading to a situation where the opponent can always mirror the moves until one player runs out of coins.
- If one of `a` or `b` is odd and the other is even, the player whose turn it is can always force the opponent into a losing position.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This version correctly determines the winner based on the sum of `a` and `b`. If the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
