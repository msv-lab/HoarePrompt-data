Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()`, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()`, and `a` is a value returned by `func_1()`**.

The code `a = func_1()` assigns the return value of `func_1()` to the variable `a`. Since no specific value or behavior of `func_1()` is provided, `a` simply holds the return value of `func_1()`. The preconditions for `n` and `x` remain unchanged, meaning `n` is a value returned by `func_3()` and `x` is also a value returned by `func_3()`, adhering to the given constraints.
