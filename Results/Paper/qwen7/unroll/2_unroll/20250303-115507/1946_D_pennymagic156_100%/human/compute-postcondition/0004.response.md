Output State: `n` is a value returned by `func_3()`, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()`, and `a` is a value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum count of consecutive 1s found during the loop execution.

To explain in natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` retains its initial value from `func_3()`, and `x` also retains its initial value from `func_3()`. The variable `a` retains its initial value from `func_1()`. The list `t` remains empty as it is reset to an empty list at the end of each inner loop iteration where `a` is modified. The variable `ans` holds the highest count of consecutive 1s encountered during the loop's execution, starting from index 29 down to 0.
