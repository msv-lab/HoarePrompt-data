The function reads three lines of input from the standard input. The first line contains two integers \( n \) and \( x \), where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \) and \( 0 \leq x < 2^{30} \). The second line contains \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \), each satisfying \( 0 \leq a_i < 2^{30} \). The function then converts the second line into a list of integers and returns this list.
