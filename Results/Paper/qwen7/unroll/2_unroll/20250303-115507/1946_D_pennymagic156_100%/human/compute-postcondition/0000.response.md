Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()`, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()`, and the precondition that (n, x) is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30 is still valid.**

This means that the values of `n` and `x` have been updated to the values returned by the function `func_3()`. The constraints on `n` and `x` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
