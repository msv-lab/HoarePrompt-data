Functionality: **The function processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string. If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
