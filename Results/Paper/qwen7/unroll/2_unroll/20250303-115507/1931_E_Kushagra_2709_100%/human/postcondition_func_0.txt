The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of integers in the list), `m` (an integer determining when Sasha wins), and `nums` (a list of integers). It calculates the total length of the string representations of the integers in `nums`, sorts the counts of zeros in each integer in descending order while removing every second count, and then subtracts the sum of the counts at even indices from the total. Finally, it returns "Sasha" if the adjusted total is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns "Anna".
