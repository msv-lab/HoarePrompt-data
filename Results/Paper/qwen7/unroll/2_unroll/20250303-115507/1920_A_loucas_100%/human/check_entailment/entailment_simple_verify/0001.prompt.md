You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: Output State: The value of `num` after all iterations of the loop have been executed, which is calculated based on the logic inside the loop. This value represents the count of elements in `no` that fall within the range between `min(less)` and `max(big)`, adjusted by subtracting 1 for each such element. If `num` is less than 1 after adjustments, it will be printed as 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`loop`) and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`).
   - It then reads the constraints and categorizes them into `big`, `less`, and `no` lists based on their types.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The initial number of valid `k` values is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This logic is correct because `k` must be within the range defined by the minimum of the "less" constraints and the maximum of the "big" constraints.

3. **Handling No Constraints:**
   - The function correctly checks if the initial count of valid `k` values is less than 1, and if so, prints `0`.

4. **Excluding No Constraints:**
   - For each value in the `no` list, the function checks if it falls within the valid range `[max(big), min(less)]`.
   - If a value from the `no` list falls within this range, it subtracts 1 from the count of valid `k` values. This is correct because such a value cannot be included in the valid range.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where the constraints might overlap or exclude each other correctly.
   - The guarantees in the problem statement ensure that the solution will always produce a finite and valid result.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints.
