Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the `no` list (which contains values that `k` must not be equal to) overlaps with the range defined by `big` and `less`. Specifically, if there is a value in `no` that lies between the minimum of `less` and the maximum of `big`, the program will incorrectly subtract it from the count without considering that this value should not be included in the final count.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
3 10
1 5
2 15
3 12
```
- The constraints are: \( k \geq 10 \), \( k \leq 5 \), \( k \neq 12 \).
- The program calculates the range as \( 5 - 10 + 1 = -5 \), which is incorrect because it should be 0 since there are no valid values for \( k \).

However, the program does not account for the fact that 12 is not a valid value for \( k \) within the range [5, 10], so it should not be subtracted from the count. This oversight leads to incorrect results in cases where the `no` list intersects with the range defined by `big` and `less`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that values in `no` that fall within the range defined by `big` and `less` are excluded from the count.
