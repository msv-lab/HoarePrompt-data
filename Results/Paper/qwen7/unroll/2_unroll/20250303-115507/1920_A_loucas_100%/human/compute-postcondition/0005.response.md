Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a set of constraints. For each test case, it categorizes integers into three lists based on their types (big, less, no). It then calculates the number of integers in the 'no' list that fall within the range defined by the minimum of the 'less' list and the maximum of the 'big' list, adjusting this count by subtracting one for each such integer. If the resulting count is less than 1, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints the count. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing explicitly, but its output is printed during execution.**
