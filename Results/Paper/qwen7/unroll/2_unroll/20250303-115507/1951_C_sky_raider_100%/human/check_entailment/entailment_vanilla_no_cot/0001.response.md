### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Sorting**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case and sorts the list of ticket prices `l`. Sorting is essential because it allows us to consider the cheapest days first, which is a key strategy to minimize costs.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized to 0. `t` keeps track of the cumulative increase in ticket price due to previous purchases, `s` is used to determine how many tickets can be bought on the current day, and `c` accumulates the total cost.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each day `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each day, it calculates the maximum number of tickets that can be bought (`s = min(m, k)`), which ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day.
   - It then adds the cost of buying `s` tickets on the current day (`s * (l[i] + t)`) to the total cost `c` and updates the cumulative increase in ticket price `t` by adding `s`.
   - It also decreases the remaining number of tickets to be bought `k` by `s`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all days, the total cost `c` is printed, which represents the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is less than or equal to `m` and when `k` is greater than `m` but less than or equal to `nm`. It ensures that the logic correctly accounts for the constraints of buying up to `m` tickets per day and the cumulative increase in ticket prices.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
