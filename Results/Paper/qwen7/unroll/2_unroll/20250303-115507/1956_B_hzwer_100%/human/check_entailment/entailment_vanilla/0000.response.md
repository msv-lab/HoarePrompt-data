### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the maximum number of points you can get in the game.
   - You and Nene each have `n` cards, and Nene plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

3. **Optimal Strategy Analysis:**
   - For each unique integer `x` in your hand, if there is at least one other card with the same integer `x` in Nene's hand, she will place one of her cards with `x` on the table to block you from scoring.
   - Therefore, for each unique integer `x`, you can score at most one point if there is another card with `x` in Nene's hand.

4. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The given program counts how many times each integer appears in your hand using the `cnt` array.
   - For each count `x` in `cnt`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans`. This means if there are `x` cards with a particular integer, you can score at most `x - 1` points (since Nene can block one of them).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the distribution of cards correctly and calculates the maximum possible points you can get based on the counts of each integer.

6. **Verification:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the program.
   - The logic of counting occurrences and calculating the maximum possible points aligns with the problem's constraints and optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene.

### Correctness:
**True**
