Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, after the loop executes all the iterations, r is an integer representing the final value, rem is an integer representing the remaining value of k after the loop, y is an integer representing the count of additional elements considered in the last iteration, and the result is printed as ((r - 1) * n + 1) + rem + y.
