You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, the problem description implies that the function should interact with an external entity to perform queries and receive responses. The variables n, a, b, c, d, x, y, and the permutation p are not part of the function's parameters but are used in the interaction process.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of two integers separated by a space. The first integer represents the value of `prev` after the loop completes, and the second integer represents the value of `v1` after the loop completes. These values are determined by the comparisons made within the loop based on the user's input ('<' or '>').
    #
    #In each iteration of the loop, `v1` is updated to `v2` if the user inputs '<', and `prev` is updated to `i` if the user inputs '>'. The final values of `prev` and `v1` after all iterations represent the output state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and interacts with an external entity to perform queries and receive responses. Based on the responses, it may return either an error message if the age is negative or categorize the input as 'minor' or 'adult'.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
