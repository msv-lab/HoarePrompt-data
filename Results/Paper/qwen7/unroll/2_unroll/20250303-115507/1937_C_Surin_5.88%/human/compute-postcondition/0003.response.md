Output State: The output state will consist of two integers separated by a space. The first integer represents the value of `prev` after the second loop completes, and the second integer represents the value of `v1` after the second loop completes. These values are determined based on the comparisons made within the loops.

In each iteration of the first loop, the code compares pairs of indices and updates `v1` based on the comparison result ('<' indicates `v1` should be updated to `v2`). The second loop then uses these updated values to further refine `prev`. After all iterations, the final values of `prev` and `v1` are printed.
