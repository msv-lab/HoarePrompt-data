Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the edge cases where the string `s` consists of a single unique character or is a single character, printing "No" in these scenarios.
2. For other cases, the program attempts to generate a new string `s2` by either shuffling the characters of `s` or performing a cyclic shift if the shuffle results in the original string.
3. The program ensures that `s2` is different from `s` by either directly performing a cyclic shift or ensuring that the shuffled string is different through a simple check.
4. The program outputs "Yes" followed by the generated string `s2` for valid cases, and "No" for invalid cases.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output based on the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
