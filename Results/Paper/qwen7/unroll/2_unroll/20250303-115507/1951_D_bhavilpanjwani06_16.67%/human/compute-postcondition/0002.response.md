Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an input integer less than `k`, where `k` is another input integer.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since no specific values for `n` and `k` are given, and the `print` statement does not depend on these variables, the output will be the literal string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
