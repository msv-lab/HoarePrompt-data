Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. `n` is equal to `k`, where `k` is an input integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. The print statement simply outputs the integer `1`. Since no other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, the output is simply `1`.
