Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We know that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.
2. `n` is equal to `k`, where `k` is an input integer.
3. `n` is also stated to be greater than or equal to `k`.

Given this information, the key variable here is `n`, which is directly set to `k` and is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `k`.

When the `print(n)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is equal to k)**
