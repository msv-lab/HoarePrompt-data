Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, the value of `t` is updated to the integer input, but the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 still holds true. All other variables remain unchanged, and the constraint on `n` remains as it is not affected by this code snippet.
