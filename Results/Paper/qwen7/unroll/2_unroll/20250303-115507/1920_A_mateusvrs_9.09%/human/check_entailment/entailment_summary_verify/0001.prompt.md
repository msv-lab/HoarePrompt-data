You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx >= ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` followed by `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)`. For each pair, it updates variables `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` based on the value of `a`. After processing all pairs for each test case, it calculates a result based on the values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` and appends this result to a list `r`. Finally, it prints the list `r` containing the calculated results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `t` as the number of test cases. It also initializes an empty list `r` to store results for each test case. Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to handle the constraints of type 1 and type 2 respectively. `cx` is a set to handle the constraints of type 3.

2. **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`. Then, it processes each constraint:
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**: After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If true, it means no integer `k` can satisfy all constraints, so it appends `0` to `r`.

4. **Counting Valid Integers**: If `bx < ax`, it counts the number of integers in `cx` that lie between `bx` and `ax`. The number of valid integers `k` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of integers in `cx` that lie within `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly handles all specified cases and guarantees that the solution is finite and valid.
