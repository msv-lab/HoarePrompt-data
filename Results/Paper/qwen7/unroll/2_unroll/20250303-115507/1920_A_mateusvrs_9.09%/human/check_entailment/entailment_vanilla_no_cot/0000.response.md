Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`) and `bx` to `-1` to keep track of the upper and lower bounds of valid `k` values.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3 (i.e., `k != x`).

3. **Updating Bounds**:
   - For constraints of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`.
   - For constraints of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`.
   - For constraints of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it means there are no valid `k` values, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of invalid `k` values (those in `cx` and within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Outputting Results**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the number of valid `k` values for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
