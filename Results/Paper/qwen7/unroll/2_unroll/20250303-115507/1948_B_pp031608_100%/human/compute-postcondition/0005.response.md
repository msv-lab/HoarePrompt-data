Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first `n-1` integers can be rearranged by swapping adjacent elements to form non-decreasing sequences. If any sequence cannot be rearranged to be non-decreasing, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".**
