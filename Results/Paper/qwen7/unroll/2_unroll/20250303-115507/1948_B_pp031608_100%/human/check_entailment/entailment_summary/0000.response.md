Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The program attempts to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by comparing adjacent elements and attempting to sort them. However, the problem requires breaking down numbers into their individual digits and reinserting them, which is not what the current implementation does.

Here's why the provided solution is incorrect:
1. The program tries to sort adjacent elements directly, but it doesn't handle the process of breaking down numbers into digits and reinserting them.
2. The logic inside the loop where it checks `if nums != sorted(nums)` is incorrect because it doesn't reflect the actual operation required by the problem statement.
3. The program does not actually perform the digit-breaking and reinsertion operations as specified in the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
