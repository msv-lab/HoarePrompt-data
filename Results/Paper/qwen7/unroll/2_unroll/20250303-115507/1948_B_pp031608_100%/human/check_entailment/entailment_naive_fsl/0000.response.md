Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Specifically, the program checks if the current element is less than the previous element and attempts to split the previous element to see if sorting is possible. However, this approach is flawed because it only considers the immediate previous element and does not account for the possibility of splitting elements further back in the array to achieve a sorted state.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
12 34 56 78
```

The program would not correctly determine that it is possible to sort the array by splitting the elements appropriately. The correct approach would involve checking if the array can be transformed into a sorted state by considering all possible splits of the elements, not just the immediate previous element.
