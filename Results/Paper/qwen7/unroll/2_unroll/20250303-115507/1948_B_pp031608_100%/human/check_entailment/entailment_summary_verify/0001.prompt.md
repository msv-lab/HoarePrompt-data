You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first `n-1` integers can be rearranged by swapping adjacent elements to form non-decreasing sequences. If any sequence cannot be rearranged to be non-decreasing, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `m` and the array elements.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted initially.
   
3. **Loop Through Array**:
   - The loop runs from `m-1` to `1` (inclusive).
   - For each element `arr[i]` (where `i` starts from `m-1`), it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`.

4. **Check Condition**:
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, it converts `arr[i-1]` to a list of its digits and appends `arr[i]` to it.
   - It then checks if the combined list of digits is sorted.
   - If not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Print Result**:
   - After the loop, it prints "NO" if `ans` is `False`, otherwise it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Sorting Check**:
   - The program checks if the combined list of digits is sorted by comparing `nums` directly with `sorted(nums)`. This is incorrect because the comparison should be done element-wise or by converting back to integers and comparing.
   - For example, `[1, 2]` and `[1, 2, 3]` are not sorted in the context of this problem.

2. **Handling Digits**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the process of splitting and reinserting digits. It only checks the condition but does not actually perform the split and reinsertion to ensure the array can be sorted.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array is already sorted or when the operations do not lead to a sorted array.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        
        # Perform the operation to split and sort
        while ans:
            ans = False
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
                    nums = [int(digit) for digit in str(arr[i])]
                    arr[i] = 0
                    arr[i:i+1] = nums
                    ans = True
                    break
        
        # Check if the array is now sorted
        if arr == sorted(arr):
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical errors and does not correctly implement the required operations. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
