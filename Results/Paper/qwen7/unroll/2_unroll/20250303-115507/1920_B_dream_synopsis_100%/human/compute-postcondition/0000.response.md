Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is a placeholder used to iterate over the range returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Since `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer representing the number of iterations, the loop will execute exactly `t` times.

3. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer, which it already is according to the problem statement. However, since the loop body is omitted, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is valid and results in a positive integer.

Given the problem statement and the loop head, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer, which is already guaranteed by the problem constraints.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.**
