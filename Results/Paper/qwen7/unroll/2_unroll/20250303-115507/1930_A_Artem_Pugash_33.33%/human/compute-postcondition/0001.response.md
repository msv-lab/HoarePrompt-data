Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `numCases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Typically, when a `for` loop starts, the loop variable `i` is initialized to the starting value, which is usually 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `numCases`. Therefore, `numCases` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States**: Based on the above points, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 and `numCases` is greater than 0.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `numCases` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `numCases` must be greater than 0**
