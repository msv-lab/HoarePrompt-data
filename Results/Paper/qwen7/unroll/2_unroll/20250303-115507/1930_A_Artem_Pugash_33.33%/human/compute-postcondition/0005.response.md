Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers in ascending order, then iterates through the sorted list, taking pairs of integers, and sums up the minimum value of each pair. Finally, it prints the total sum for each test case.**
