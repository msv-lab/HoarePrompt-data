Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and processes each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Sorting**: For each test case, the program reads `2n` integers and stores them in a list called `numbers`. It then sorts this list in ascending order. Sorting is necessary because we want to always pick the smallest available numbers to maximize the score, as per the problem statement.

3. **Scoring Logic**: After sorting, the program enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from the list, calculates their minimum, and adds it to the score (`suma`). This ensures that the smallest available numbers are paired together, which maximizes the score.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total score for each test case.

Given the above points, the program correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem description and the annotated program. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
