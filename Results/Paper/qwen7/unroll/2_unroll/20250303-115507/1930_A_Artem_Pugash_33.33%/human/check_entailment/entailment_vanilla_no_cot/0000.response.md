Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the score. The issue lies in how pairs are selected and added to the score. The current implementation simply pops the first two elements from the sorted list and adds their minimum value to the score, which does not guarantee the maximum score possible.

To achieve the maximum score, you should always pair the smallest available number with the next smallest available number. This ensures that the sum of the minimums is maximized at each step.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = 0
        while numbers:
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)
```

This corrected version sorts the list of numbers and then iteratively pops the smallest two numbers, ensuring that the score is maximized at each step.
