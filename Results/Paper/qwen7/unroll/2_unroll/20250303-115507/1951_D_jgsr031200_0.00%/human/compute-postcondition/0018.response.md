Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `costs` is defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each value in `costs` (ignoring the last element since it's always 1).
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Since `n` is 0, `costs` becomes `[0 - k + 1, 1] = [1 - k, 1]`.

3. **Calculate `h`:**
   - According to the definition, `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each value in `costs` (ignoring the last element since it's always 1). 
   - This means `h` is the sum of `0 / (1 - k) + 0 / 1`.
   - Since `0 / (1 - k)` and `0 / 1` both evaluate to 0, `h` is `0 + 0 = 0`.

4. **Check the Condition:**
   - The condition states that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`. Given that `h` is 0, this condition is only true if `k` is 0 or negative. However, the problem does not specify the value of `k`, but we know from the condition that `h >= k`.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(2)`.
   - This will directly print the integer `2`.

Given the above steps, the output of the print statement is clearly `2`.

Output: **2**
