Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `costs` is defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each value in `costs` (ignoring the last element since it's always 1).
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Substitute the value of `n`:**
   - Since `n` is 0, `costs` becomes `[0 - k + 1, 1]`, which simplifies to `[1 - k, 1]`.

3. **Determine the value of `h`:**
   - `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each value in `costs` (ignoring the last element since it's always 1).
   - Given `n` is 0, `h` would be `0 / (1 - k) + 0 / 1`, which simplifies to `0`.
   - However, the problem states that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`. This implies that `k` must be 0 or negative for `h` to be non-negative, but since `h` is specifically stated to be greater than or equal to `k`, and `h` is derived from division by a non-zero number, `k` cannot be zero or negative. Therefore, there might be a contradiction here unless `k` is explicitly 0. For the sake of this problem, let's assume `k` is 0 (as it's the simplest case where `h` is non-negative).

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(*costs)`.
   - This will print the elements of the list `costs` separated by spaces.

Given the above steps, the list `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`. If `k` is 0, then `costs` is `[1, 1]`.

Output: **1 1**
