Output: **1**

Explanation: According to the initial state, both `n` and `k` are positive integers with values between 1 and \(10^{18}\), and it is explicitly stated that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. The print statement simply outputs the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the output is `1`.
