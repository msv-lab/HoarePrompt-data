#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100. b is a list of q integers representing the number of players initially joining the game where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ q.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a list containing each element of the original list a minus 1.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list 'b' which contains q integers representing the number of players initially joining the game, where each integer n_i satisfies 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is another list of integers. Depending on the condition `(a <= b)`, the function either returns a new list where each element from the original list `a` is decremented by 1, or it returns the list `b` as is.
