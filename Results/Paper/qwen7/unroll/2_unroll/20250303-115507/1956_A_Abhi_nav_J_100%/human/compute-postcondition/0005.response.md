Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is another list of integers. Depending on the condition `(a <= b)`, the function either returns a new list where each element from the original list `a` is decremented by 1, or it returns the list `b` as is.**
