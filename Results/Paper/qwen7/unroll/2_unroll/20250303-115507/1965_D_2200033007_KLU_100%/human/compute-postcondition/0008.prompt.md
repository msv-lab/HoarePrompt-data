You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array a, excluding one sum. n is an integer representing the size of the array a, and 3 <= n <= 1000.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `idx` is -1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of length `n` where each element is either 0 or half the difference between consecutive elements in `odds` list (if `idx` is not at the center), `prev` is the last element of `odds`. The list `a` is symmetric around its center if `n` is odd, and `a[idx]` is set to the current element of `odds` when `idx` is at the center.
    return a
    #The program returns a list 'a' of length 'n', which is symmetric around its center. Each element in 'a' is either 0 or half the difference between consecutive elements in the 'odds' list, depending on the position and whether 'idx' is at the center or not. If 'idx' is at the center, 'a[idx]' is set to the current element of 'odds'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `odds` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` of length `n` that is symmetric around its center. Each element in `a` is either 0 or half the difference between consecutive elements in the `odds` list, depending on the position and whether the index is at the center or not. If the index is at the center, the corresponding element in `a` is set to the current element of `odds`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list 'a' of length 'n', which is symmetric around its center. Each element in 'a' is either 0 or half the difference between consecutive elements in the 'odds' list, depending on the position and whether 'idx' is at the center or not. If 'idx' is at the center, 'a[idx]' is set to the current element of 'odds'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
