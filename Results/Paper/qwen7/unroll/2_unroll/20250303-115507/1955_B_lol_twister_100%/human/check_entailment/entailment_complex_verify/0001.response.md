### Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l` of integers.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to check if the given list `l` can form a progressive square.
3. **Progressive Square Construction**:
   - The function calculates the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It then constructs the expected progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each cell `(k, h)` in the `n x n` matrix.
   - The constructed list `li` is sorted.
4. **Comparison**:
   - The function sorts the original list `l` and compares it with the sorted list `li`.
   - If they match, it returns `'yes'`, indicating that the list `l` can form a progressive square.
   - Otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic in the function `func_1`:

1. **Calculation of `li`**:
   - The function constructs the list `li` using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each cell `(k, h)` in the `n x n` matrix. This is correct.
   - However, the function assumes that the minimum value `a` is always the starting point of the progressive square. This might not be true in all cases. For example, if the minimum value `a` is not the smallest possible value that can be generated by the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, the function will fail.

2. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - The function sorts both `l` and `li` before comparing them. This is correct.
   - However, the function does not account for the fact that the minimum value `a` might not be the smallest possible value that can be generated by the formula. This could lead to incorrect results.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- `n = 3`, `c = 2`, `d = 3`
- `l = [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]`

In this case, the minimum value `a` is `1`, but the smallest possible value in the progressive square is `1 + 0 * 2 + 0 * 3 = 1`. The function would correctly generate the list `li` and compare it with `l`.

However, consider another example:
- `n = 3`, `c = 2`, `d = 3`
- `l = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 1]`

In this case, the minimum value `a` is `1`, but the smallest possible value in the progressive square is still `1`. The function would incorrectly generate the list `li` and compare it with `l`.

Therefore, the function does not handle all edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function `func_1` does not correctly handle all possible cases where the minimum value `a` might not be the smallest possible value that can be generated by the formula `a + k * c + d * h`.

### Final:
**False**
