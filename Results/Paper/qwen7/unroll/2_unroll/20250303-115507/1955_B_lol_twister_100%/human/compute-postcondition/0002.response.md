State: **`a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `n` must be between 2 and 500, `k` must be 0, `li` is an empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `k` and the range `range(0, n)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `k`**: Since the loop starts with `k = 0`, `k` must be set to 0 before the loop begins.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be a valid integer within the range 2 to 500.
4. **Other variables**: The variables `a`, `c`, `d`, and `li` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. They remain in their given states.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` being 0 and `n` being between 2 and 500.
