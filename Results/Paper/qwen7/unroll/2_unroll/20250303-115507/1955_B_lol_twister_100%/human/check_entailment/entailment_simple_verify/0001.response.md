### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l` of integers.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to check if the given list `l` can form a progressive square.
   - This part is also correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Progressive Square Construction**:
   - The function calculates the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It then constructs the expected progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each cell `(k, h)` in the `n x n` matrix.
   - The constructed list `li` is sorted.
   - Here is the key issue: The formula `a + k * c + d * h` assumes that the progressive square starts from the minimum value `a` and increments by `c` along rows and by `d` along columns. However, this formula does not account for the fact that the progressive square should be filled row-wise and column-wise in a consistent manner.

4. **Comparison**:
   - The function sorts the original list `l` and compares it with the sorted list `li`.
   - If they match, it returns `'yes'`, indicating that the list `l` can form a progressive square.
   - Otherwise, it returns `'no'`.
   - The comparison step is correct, but the construction of `li` might not always produce the correct progressive square due to the issue mentioned above.

### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example provided in the problem description:
- For `n = 3`, `c = 2`, and `d = 3`, the expected progressive square is:
```
1 3 5
4 7 10
7 10 13
```
- If we take the minimum value `a = 1` and construct the list `li` using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, we get:
```
1 3 5
4 7 10
7 10 13
```
- Sorting both `l` and `li` would yield the same result, and the function would return `'yes'`.

However, consider the second example:
- For `n = 3`, `c = 2`, and `d = 3`, the input list `l` is `[3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 11, 4, 8]`.
- The minimum value `a = 1` and constructing `li` using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` would give:
```
1 3 5
4 7 10
7 10 13
```
- Sorting `l` gives `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 11]`, which does not match `li`.
- The function incorrectly returns `'no'`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not correctly construct the progressive square because it does not ensure that the elements are placed in the correct order (row-wise and column-wise). Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
