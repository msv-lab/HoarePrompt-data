### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` as inputs.
   - It initializes `a` as the minimum value in `l`.
   - It then constructs a list `li` where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Both `li` and `l` are sorted.
   - Finally, it checks if `l` and `li` are equal and returns `'yes'` or `'no'` accordingly.

3. **Key Points:**
   - The function assumes that the minimum value in `l` (`a`) is the starting point for the progressive square.
   - The constructed list `li` is based on the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, which should theoretically generate the correct progressive square if the input list `l` can be rearranged to match this pattern.
   - The sorting step ensures that both `l` and `li` are in the same order, making the comparison valid.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum value `a` in the input list `l`.
   - It then constructs a list `li` based on the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, which should generate the correct progressive square if the input list can be rearranged to match this pattern.
   - Sorting both `l` and `li` before comparing them ensures that the comparison is valid regardless of the initial order of elements in `l`.

Given the annotations and the problem description, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for constructing a progressive square. The original assessment was incorrect because the program does indeed follow the rules to generate the correct progressive square based on the minimum value in the input list.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
