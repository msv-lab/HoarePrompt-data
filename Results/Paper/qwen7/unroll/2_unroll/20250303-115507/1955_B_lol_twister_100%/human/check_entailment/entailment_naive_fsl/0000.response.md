Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for constructing a progressive square. Specifically, the program generates a sequence `li` based on the minimum value `a` in the input list `l`, but this approach does not guarantee that the generated sequence matches the required progressive square pattern for all possible inputs. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8
```
- Expected Output: "NO"
- Program Output: "YES"

In this case, the program incorrectly returns "YES" because it generates a sequence based on the minimum value in the input list, which does not necessarily match the required progressive square pattern. The correct approach would involve checking if the input list can be rearranged to form a progressive square according to the given rules.
