### Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l` of integers.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to check if the given list `l` can form a progressive square.
3. **Progressive Square Construction**:
   - The function calculates the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It then constructs the expected progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each cell `(k, h)` in the `n x n` matrix.
   - The constructed list `li` is sorted.
4. **Comparison**:
   - The function sorts the original list `l` and compares it with the sorted list `li`.
   - If they match, it returns `'yes'`, indicating that the list `l` can form a progressive square.
   - Otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic used to construct the expected progressive square. The formula `a + k * c + d * h` is incorrect because it does not account for the correct placement of elements in the matrix. Specifically, the formula should be `a + k * (n * c + d) + h * d` to ensure the correct placement of elements in the matrix.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- For `n = 3`, `c = 2`, and `d = 3`, the expected progressive square is:
  ```
  1  3  5
  7  9  11
  13 15 17
  ```

Using the current formula `a + k * c + d * h`, the constructed list would be:
- For `k = 0` and `h = 0`: `1 + 0 * 2 + 0 * 3 = 1`
- For `k = 0` and `h = 1`: `1 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 3 = 4`
- For `k = 0` and `h = 2`: `1 + 0 * 2 + 2 * 3 = 7`
- For `k = 1` and `h = 0`: `1 + 1 * 2 + 0 * 3 = 3`
- For `k = 1` and `h = 1`: `1 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 3 = 6`
- For `k = 1` and `h = 2`: `1 + 1 * 2 + 2 * 3 = 9`
- For `k = 2` and `h = 0`: `1 + 2 * 2 + 0 * 3 = 5`
- For `k = 2` and `h = 1`: `1 + 2 * 2 + 1 * 3 = 8`
- For `k = 2` and `h = 2`: `1 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 3 = 11`

This results in the list `[1, 4, 7, 3, 6, 9, 5, 8, 11]`, which is not sorted correctly.

To fix this, the correct formula should be:
```python
li = []
for k in range(n):
    for h in range(n):
        li.append(a + k * (n * c + d) + h * d)
```

With this corrected formula, the constructed list will match the expected progressive square, ensuring the correct comparison.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate due to the incorrect formula used to construct the progressive square. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
