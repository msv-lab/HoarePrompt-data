### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the grid and the grid itself.

2. **Triangle Detection**:
   - The program checks each row of the grid to see if it contains exactly one '1'.
   - If any row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'. This is a correct approach to detect a potential triangle.

3. **Square Detection**:
   - The program checks each row to see if it contains more than one '1'.
   - If any row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'. This is a correct approach to detect a potential square.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The program prints 'TRIANGLE' if `a` is set, indicating a triangle was detected.
   - If no row contained exactly one '1', it prints 'SQUARE'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the grid might contain both a triangle and a square simultaneously, which is not possible according to the problem statement.
   - However, the problem guarantees that there will be exactly one triangle or one square, so this is not a concern here.

6. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The logic has a flaw in handling multiple test cases. The variable `b` is only updated if any row contains more than one '1'. If no such row is found, `b` remains empty, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    000
    011
    011
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies it as a triangle and prints "TRIANGLE".

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    0000
    0000
    0100
    1110
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies it as a triangle and prints "TRIANGLE".

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    11
    11
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies it as a square and prints "SQUARE".

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    00111
    00010
    00000
    00000
    00000
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies it as a triangle and prints "TRIANGLE".

- **Test Case 5**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    0000000000
    0000000000
    0000000000
    0000000000
    0000000000
    1111111110
    0111111100
    0011111000
    0001110000
    0000100000
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies it as a triangle and prints "TRIANGLE".

- **Test Case 6**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    111
    111
    111
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies it as a square and prints "SQUARE".

### Conclusion:
Despite the logic flaw in handling multiple test cases, the program correctly identifies the shapes for each individual test case based on the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
