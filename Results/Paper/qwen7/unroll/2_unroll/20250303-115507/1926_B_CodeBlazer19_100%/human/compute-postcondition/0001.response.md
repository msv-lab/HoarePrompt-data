State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = t-1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute at all.
3. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be set to 0 because the loop starts iterating from 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
