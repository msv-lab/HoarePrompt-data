### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program checks each row to see if it contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes a triangle. However, this logic is flawed because:
     - A triangle can have multiple rows with more than one '1'. For example, consider the following grid:
       ```
       00000
       00000
       01110
       01110
       00000
       ```
       This grid contains a square but the program would incorrectly identify it as a triangle because the third and fourth rows each have three '1's.
     - A square can have rows with only one '1' if the '1's are aligned in a way that doesn't form a continuous block. For example:
       ```
       00000
       00000
       01110
       01110
       01110
       ```
       This grid contains a triangle but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because the third, fourth, and fifth rows each have three '1's.

2. **Handling Continuous Blocks**:
   - The program does not check if the '1's form a continuous block, which is required for both shapes. For example, in the grid:
     ```
     00000
     00000
     01110
     01110
     00000
     ```
     The '1's form a continuous block in the third and fourth rows, indicating a square. Similarly, in the grid:
     ```
     00000
     00000
     01110
     01110
     01110
     ```
     The '1's form a continuous triangular pattern in the third, fourth, and fifth rows.

3. **Misinterpretation of Input**:
   - The program assumes that if any row has exactly one '1', it must be a triangle. This is incorrect because the '1's could form a square instead. Conversely, if any row has more than one '1', it assumes a square, which is also incorrect because the '1's could form a triangle instead.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square due to its flawed logic and lack of proper checks for continuous blocks of '1's.

### Final:
Final: **False**
