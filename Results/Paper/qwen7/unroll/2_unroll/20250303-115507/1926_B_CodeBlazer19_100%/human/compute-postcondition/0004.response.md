Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented as a list of n strings. Each string contains n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1. The function returns whether the grid contains a triangle or a square.**

This means the function takes a grid (a list of strings) as an implicit input through its internal processing and checks if the grid forms a specific shape (either a triangle or a square) made up entirely of '1's, where the size of the shape is greater than 1. It then returns a value indicating the type of shape found.
