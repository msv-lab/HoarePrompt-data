Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the game logic. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Game Logic**: The solution checks only the parity of `n` and the count of 'U' and 'D'. This is insufficient because the game involves specific operations that change the state of the coins, and these operations need to be considered.

2. **Game State Transition**: The key point is that the game is about choosing a facing-up coin and flipping its neighbors. This means the state of the game changes dynamically, and simply counting 'U' and 'D' does not capture the essence of the game.

3. **Optimal Play Consideration**: The solution does not account for the optimal strategy where players make moves to force the opponent into a losing position. The current logic does not reflect this.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the game or derive a more complex logic that considers the sequence of moves and the resulting states. The current solution fails to do this and thus is incorrect.
