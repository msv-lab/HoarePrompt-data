Output State: **The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to one iteration of the outer loop. For each line, if the sum of the modified array (where each element is the product of all elements divided by the current element) is greater than or equal to the product of all elements, it will print -1. Otherwise, it will print the modified array elements separated by spaces. The exact values depend on the input provided for each iteration.**
