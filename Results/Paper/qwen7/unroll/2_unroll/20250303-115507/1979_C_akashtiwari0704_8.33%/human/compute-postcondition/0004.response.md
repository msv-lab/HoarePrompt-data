Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `bets` and a list of `bets` positive integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates the product of all elements in `a`, then modifies each element to be the product of all elements divided by the current element. It computes the sum of these modified elements and compares it to the original product. If the sum is greater than or equal to the product, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the modified elements as a space-separated string. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each test case containing between 1 and 50 elements, where each element is between 2 and 20.**
