Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\). It then constructs a list `nums` containing up to 24 unique elements derived from \(k\) and fixed values of \(2^i\) for \(i\) in range(21). Specifically, it includes \(k\), \(k - 2^j\) (where \(2^j\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\)), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^j + 1\), and removes one element based on the value of \(k\). Finally, it prints the number of elements in `nums` followed by the elements themselves for each test case.**
