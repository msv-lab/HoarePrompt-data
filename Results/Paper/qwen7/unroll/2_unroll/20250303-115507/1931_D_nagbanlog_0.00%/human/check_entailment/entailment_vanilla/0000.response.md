### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` where a pair `<i, j>` is considered beautiful if:
   - \( a_i + a_j \) is divisible by `x`.
   - \( a_i - a_j \) is divisible by `y`.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `t` test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it initializes variables like `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
   - For each element `num` in the array, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y` using modulo operations.
   - It then calculates the required `mod_x` and `mod_y` values to form a beautiful pair.
   - If the required `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pair exists in the `freq` dictionary, it increments the `beautiful_count` by the frequency of this pair.
   - Finally, it updates the frequency of the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair in the `freq` dictionary.

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - The logic for calculating `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` seems correct.
   - The use of the `freq` dictionary to count occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs is appropriate.
   - The increment of `beautiful_count` when a matching pair is found is correctly implemented.
   - The overall structure and flow of the code appear to be correct for counting beautiful pairs.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The solution handles the constraints appropriately, including the range of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array elements.
   - The solution accounts for the possibility of duplicate elements in the array, which is crucial for accurate counting.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The function prints intermediate steps for debugging purposes but does not affect the final result.
   - The output format matches the expected format for the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs in the array according to the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
