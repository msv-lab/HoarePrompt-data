### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the number of beautiful pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in the array \(a\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\).
   - A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries containing the parameters and arrays for each test case).
   - For each test case, it initializes variables such as `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of each pair of remainders when elements of the array are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders and checks if these remainders have been seen before.
   - If the required remainder pair exists in `freq`, it adds the corresponding count to `beautiful_count`.

3. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The logic for calculating the required remainders and checking their existence in `freq` is correct.
   - The main issue is with the logic for determining the beautiful pairs. The current implementation assumes that if a pair of remainders is found, it means a beautiful pair exists, which is not necessarily true without further validation.
   - The correct approach would be to check both conditions \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) and \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) for each pair \((i, j)\).

4. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement using the given program.
   - For the first test case: \(n = 6\), \(x = 5\), \(y = 2\), and \(a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]\).
     - The beautiful pairs are \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\) and \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\).
     - The program should correctly identify these pairs.
   - The program correctly identifies the pairs \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\) and \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\) because:
     - For \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\): \(a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10\) (divisible by 5) and \(a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8\) (divisible by 2).
     - For \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\): \(a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10\) (divisible by 5) and \(a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2\) (divisible by 2).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Upon closer inspection, the program correctly implements the logic to find beautiful pairs. The current approach ensures that both conditions \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\) are met simultaneously for each pair.

### Correctness:
**True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and accurately finds the number of beautiful pairs in the array.
