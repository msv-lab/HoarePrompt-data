Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
