Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. For each test case, the output depends on the relative positions of the points (xa, ya) and (xb, yb) within the grid defined by dimensions h and w. If xa is greater than xb, the output is always 'Draw'. Otherwise, the output is determined by checking if Alice or Bob can capture the opponent based on their respective positions and the calculated values of x, l, and r.
