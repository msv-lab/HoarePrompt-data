Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to check if the remaining elements in the lists after removing the author's position are consistent across all screenshots. This is crucial because the remaining elements should form a consistent order that matches the original order of participants.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

However, the provided program would incorrectly output "YES" because it does not properly validate the consistency of the remaining elements in the lists.

To illustrate, let's walk through the provided program with the above test case:

1. The first screenshot shows `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the second screenshot shows `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
2. After removing the author's position (1 and 5), the remaining elements are `[2, 3, 4]` and `[4, 3, 2]`, respectively.
3. The program checks if these remaining elements are consistent, but it does not correctly handle the inconsistency here.

Since the program fails to correctly validate the consistency of the remaining elements, it cannot accurately determine if the screenshots correspond to a valid order of participants. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
