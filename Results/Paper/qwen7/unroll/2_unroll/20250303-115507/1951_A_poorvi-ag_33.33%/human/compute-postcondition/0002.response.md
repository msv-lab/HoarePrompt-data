State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because the `range(t)` function will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute.
3. Initially, `i` should be set to 0 as it is the starting index for the loop.
4. The other variables (`start`, `end`, and `results`) do not affect the loop's execution and can remain as given.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 0 and `t` to be greater than 0.
