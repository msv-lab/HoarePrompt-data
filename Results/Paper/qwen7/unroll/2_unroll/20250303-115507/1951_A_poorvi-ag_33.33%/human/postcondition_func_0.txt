The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a binary string `arr`. It checks if the string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and includes the substring '11'. If so, it appends 'no' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'yes' if the number of '1's is even, and 'no' if the number of '1's is odd. Finally, it prints the contents of the results list.
