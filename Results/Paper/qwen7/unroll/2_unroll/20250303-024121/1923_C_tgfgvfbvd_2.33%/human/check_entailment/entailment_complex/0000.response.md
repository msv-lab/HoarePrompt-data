Reasoning:  
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the given problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `c` itself. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix sums for the array `c` and stores them in the list `p`. This is done correctly using the formula `c[i] = c[i] + c[i-1]`.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program reads the start and end indices `a` and `b` and calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a-1]` to `c[b-1]` using the prefix sums. The sum of the subarray is calculated as `s = p[b-1] - (p[a-2] if a > 1 else 0)`.

4. **Checking the Condition**: The program checks if the sum of the subarray `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray (`b - a + 1`). If `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, it prints 'YES', indicating the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the results of the queries for each test case, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
