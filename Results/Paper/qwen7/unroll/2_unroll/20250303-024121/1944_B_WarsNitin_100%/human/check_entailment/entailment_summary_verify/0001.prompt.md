You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2 1
    
    1 2 2 1
    
    6 1
    
    6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4
    
    4 1
    
    1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
    
    6 2
    
    5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

Output

    2 1
    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. It sorts the first half and the second half of the list separately. Based on the value of k, it constructs two lists, ans1 and ans2, by selecting elements from the sorted halves, ensuring no element is repeated more than necessary. Finally, it prints these two lists for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Dividing the Array:**
   - The array `a` is split into two halves: `b` (first `n` elements) and `c` (last `n` elements).

3. **Sorting Halves:**
   - Both halves `b` and `c` are sorted.

4. **Constructing Arrays `l` and `r`:**
   - The program attempts to construct arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that their bitwise XORs are equal.
   - It starts by checking for unique elements in `b` and `c` and adding them to `l` and `r` if they exist.
   - It then tries to fill `l` and `r` with pairs of elements from `b` and `c` that match, ensuring the XOR condition is met.
   - Finally, it fills the remaining positions in `l` and `r` with elements from `l` itself.

### Issues Identified

1. **Handling Unique Elements:**
   - The program checks for unique elements in `b` and `c` but does not handle the case where both `b` and `c` have the same unique element. This could lead to incorrect results if the unique element appears in both halves.

2. **Filling `l` and `r`:**
   - The program assumes that it can always find pairs of elements from `b` and `c` to satisfy the XOR condition. However, this might not be true for all cases. For example, if the XOR of the entire array `a` is zero, the program might fail to find suitable pairs.

3. **Final Filling:**
   - The final filling of `l` and `r` with elements from `l` itself is unnecessary and might not guarantee the correct result. It could lead to incorrect pairs being chosen.

### Example Counter-Case

Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

- The program sorts `b` and `c` as `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- It then tries to form `l` and `r`:
  - `l` and `r` are constructed by taking pairs from `b` and `c` that match, but this might not always work correctly.
  - For example, it might produce `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `r = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is not optimal.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and might produce incorrect results. Therefore, the given program is not fully correct.
