Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding two subsets \( l \) and \( r \) of lengths \( 2k \) each, such that the XOR of elements in \( l \) equals the XOR of elements in \( r \).
2. The solution provided attempts to construct these subsets by sorting the first half and the second half of the input array separately.
3. However, the logic to construct the subsets \( l \) and \( r \) is flawed:
   - The code tries to directly append elements to `ans1` and `ans2` without ensuring the XOR condition is met.
   - The approach of simply appending elements from the sorted halves does not guarantee that the XOR of the elements in \( l \) will equal the XOR of the elements in \( r \).
4. The code does not handle the XOR condition properly. Instead, it focuses on avoiding repetition of elements, which is not sufficient to ensure the XOR equality.
5. The logic for constructing `l` and `r` is overly simplistic and does not account for the necessary conditions to satisfy the XOR requirement.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
