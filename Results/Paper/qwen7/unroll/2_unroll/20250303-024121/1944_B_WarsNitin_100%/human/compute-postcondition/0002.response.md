Output State: The output state will consist of multiple pairs of lines, each pair corresponding to the values of `ans1` and `ans2` printed in each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, `ans1` and `ans2` are derived from sorting the first and second halves of the input array `a`, respectively, and then selecting elements based on the value of `k`. Specifically, the loop will:

1. Read `t`, the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Read `n` and `k`.
   - Read the array `a` of length `2*n`.
   - Split `a` into two halves, `b` and `c`.
   - Sort `b` and `c`.
   - Initialize `ans1` and `ans2` as empty lists.
   - Adjust `k` to `2*k`.
   - Populate `l` with unique elements from the ends of `b` and intermediate elements that are unique.
   - Populate `ans1` and `ans2` with elements from `b` and `c` based on the value of `k`.
   - Print `ans1` and `ans2`.

Each line of the output will contain space-separated integers representing the elements of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.
