Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop**: The loop condition is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Current state before the loop**: The current state is given as `t` is an input integer.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: Since the loop condition requires `t > 0`, and the current state only specifies that `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
