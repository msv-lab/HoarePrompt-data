Output State: **`loop` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `loop` ≤ 500.**

Explanation: The code `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. The initial conditions for `t` and the constraints remain unchanged, but now `loop` holds the value of the integer input. The value of `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and the constraints remain as described, but since no further operations are performed on them, they are not updated.
