Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string consists entirely of '1's or entirely of '0's correctly. For such strings, the program will always output `1`, but the correct answer should be `1` for strings with only '0's and `0` for strings with only '1's.

For example, consider the input `"1111"`. The program will output `1`, but the correct answer is `0` because the string is already sorted and no cuts are needed.
