### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the binary string `s`.

2. **Count Initialization**: The variable `count` is initialized to 1, which represents the initial assumption that the entire string might be a single piece.

3. **Loop Through String**: The loop iterates through the string `s` to check for changes in consecutive characters. If a change from '0' to '1' is detected, `count` is incremented, and the `flag` is set to `True`. This logic ensures that each segment of consecutive identical characters is counted as a separate piece.

4. **Handling "01" Substring**: If the substring "01" is found anywhere in the string, the `flag` is set to `True`. After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, `count` is decremented by 1. This adjustment is necessary because the presence of "01" means the string can be split into two parts: one part ending with '0' and another starting with '1', thus reducing the required number of pieces by one.

5. **Output**: The final value of `count` is printed for each test case, which should represent the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Given the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and produces the correct output for the provided examples.
