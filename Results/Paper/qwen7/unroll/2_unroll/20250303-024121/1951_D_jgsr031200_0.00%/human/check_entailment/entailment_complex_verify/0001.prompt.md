You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `costs` list. Initially, the first element of `costs` is `n - k + 1` and the second is `1`. In each iteration, `curr` is set to `n` divided by the current element in `costs`, then `h` is incremented by `curr` and `n` is decreased by `i * curr`. Since `n` is always reduced by a value derived from itself, it will eventually reach 0. The final value of `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, both of which are integers.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: 'NO'
    else :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: [] (assuming costs is an empty list)
    #State: `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, `n` is 0, and if `h` is less than `k`, the function does nothing; otherwise, the function continues to execute the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both of which are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^18. If n equals k, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 twice and returns the value of n. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' and returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of divisions of n by each element in the list [n - k + 1, 1], prints 'NO' if this sum is less than k, and prints 'YES', 2, and the list [n - k + 1, 1] if the sum is greater than or equal to k.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires Bob to set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys jewels greedily, meaning she buys from the lowest priced stall first until she runs out of coins or reaches the end of the stalls.

### Given Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n, k):
       if n == k:
           print('YES')
           print(1)
           print(1)
           return
       if n < k:
           print('NO')
           return
       costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
       h = 0
       for i in costs:
           curr = n // i
           h += curr
           n -= i * curr
       if h < k:
           print('NO')
       else:
           print(2)
           print('YES')
           print(*costs)
   ```
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price `1`.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it attempts to find a configuration of stalls and prices.
     - It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
     - It calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each price level and sums them up.
     - If the sum is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with the calculated prices.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` only handles the case where `n == k` by setting up 1 stall with price `1`. This is a special case but not sufficient for general handling.
   - For other cases, the logic to determine the number of stalls and their prices is flawed. The current approach assumes only 2 stalls, which is too restrictive and may not always work.

2. **General Solution Requirement:**
   - The problem requires setting up at most 60 stalls, and the solution should handle all possible configurations within this constraint.
   - The current implementation does not explore all possible configurations of stalls and prices.

3. **Greedy Approach Limitations:**
   - The greedy approach used in the given code may not always lead to the correct solution. Alice's buying pattern needs to be carefully managed to ensure she buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
