Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' characters and calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum penalty.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the optimal way to split the array such that the penalty is minimized. One approach is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum penalty for each prefix of the string.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(func_1(expression, length))

def func_1(expression, length):
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [0] * (length + 1)
    
    # Calculate prefix sums
    prefix_sum = 0
    for i in range(length):
        prefix_sum += 1 if expression[i] == '+' else -1
        dp[i + 1] = min(dp[i] + abs(prefix_sum), dp[i + 1])
    
    return dp[length]

```

This solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum penalty for each prefix of the string. It iterates through the string, updating the prefix sum and the DP table accordingly. This ensures that the solution finds the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
