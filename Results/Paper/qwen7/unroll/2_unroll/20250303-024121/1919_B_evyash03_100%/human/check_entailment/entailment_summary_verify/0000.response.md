Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `length` and the string `expression`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `expression` and `length`.
   - It counts the number of '+' characters in `expression` and stores it in `count`.
   - It then calculates `sub` as `length - count`.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`, i.e., `abs(sub - count)`.

### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary states:
- The function counts the number of '+' characters in `expression`.
- It calculates the difference between `length` and this count.
- It returns the absolute value of the difference between this calculated difference and the count of '+' characters.

### Correctness Evaluation

To determine if the function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty, let's consider the problem requirements and the function's logic:

1. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The penalty for a single array `c` of length `m` is `p(c) = |c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_m| * m`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a`.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates `sub` as `length - count`, which represents the number of '-' characters.
   - It then returns `abs(sub - count)`, which is the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

However, the function `func_1` does not actually perform any splitting of the array or calculate the penalties for different splits. Instead, it simply returns a value based on the count of '+' and '-' characters, which does not reflect the actual penalty calculation described in the problem.

### Counterexample

Consider the input:
```
5
-----
```
- The expected output is 5, as explained in Example 2.
- The program's output is 0, which is incorrect.

This counterexample clearly shows that the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the required penalty calculation.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
