Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. Additionally, p is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and the interactor is not adaptive; I is a lambda function that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer.**

The code defines a lambda function `I` that processes input. It does not assign any values to `t`, `n`, or `p`, nor does it perform any operations that would change their values. Therefore, the initial conditions for these variables remain unchanged. The lambda function `I` is created but does not affect the current state of the variables.
