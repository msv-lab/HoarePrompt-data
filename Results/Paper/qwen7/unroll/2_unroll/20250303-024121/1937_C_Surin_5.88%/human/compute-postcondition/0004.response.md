Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4; `R` is a lambda function that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer; after all iterations, `prev` is the smallest index `i` (1 ≤ i < n) such that the comparison `? v1 i v1 prev` returns '>', and `v1` is the value initialized as 0.

In simpler terms, `prev` is the smallest index where the value at that index is greater than the value at `v1`, and `v1` remains 0 throughout the process.
