Output State: The output state consists of the names "Alice" or "Bob" printed for each test case based on the conditions within the loop. For each test case, if `mexsize` (the smallest missing integer) is greater than `maxsize` (the largest integer in the list), Alice wins if `mexsize` is even, and Bob wins if `mexsize` is odd. Otherwise, Alice wins if `mexsize` is odd, and Bob wins if `mexsize` is even.
