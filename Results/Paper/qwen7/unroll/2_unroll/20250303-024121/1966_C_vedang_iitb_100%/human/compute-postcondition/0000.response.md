Output State: **t is an input integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the initial number of stones in each of the n piles, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This changes the value of `t` to the input integer, while the other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
