Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a specific number of piles with a certain number of stones in each pile. The function processes these test cases and returns results based on the provided data, without accepting any parameters directly within its definition.
