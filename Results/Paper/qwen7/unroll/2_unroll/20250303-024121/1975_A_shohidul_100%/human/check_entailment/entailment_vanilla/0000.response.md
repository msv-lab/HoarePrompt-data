### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Non-Decreasing Check**: It first checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing by using `all([a[i-1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' because no operation is needed.

3. **Finding the Split Point**: If the array is not non-decreasing, it looks for the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. This indicates a potential split point.

4. **Split and Check**: After finding such a split point, it splits the array into two parts: `x` (the prefix from index 0 to `i-1`) and `y` (the suffix from index `i` to the end). It then checks two conditions:
   - `check_all_new`: Ensures that the first element of the original array (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix (`new[0]`).
   - `new_all`: Ensures that the suffix `new` is non-decreasing.

5. **Decision Making**: If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' because the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the two parts. If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly identifies when the array is already non-decreasing.
- It correctly finds the first split point where the array is not non-decreasing.
- It correctly checks if the suffix can be non-decreasing and if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix.
- The logic handles all cases as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

### Correctness:
**True**
