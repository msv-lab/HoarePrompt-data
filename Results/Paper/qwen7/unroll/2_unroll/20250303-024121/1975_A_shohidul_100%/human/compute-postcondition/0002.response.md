Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses based on the conditions checked within the loop. For each iteration, if the list `a` is non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'. If not, it checks if there exists a subsequence starting from any point that is non-increasing and non-decreasing from that point onward, printing 'YES' if such a subsequence exists and 'NO' otherwise.
