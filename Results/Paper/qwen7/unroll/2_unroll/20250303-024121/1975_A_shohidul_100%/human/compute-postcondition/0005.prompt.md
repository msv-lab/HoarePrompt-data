You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the input values of `t`, `n`, and `a` for each iteration of the loop. For each `t` iterations, the program checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing. If it is, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there exists a subsequence starting from any index that is non-decreasing and its first element is greater than or equal to the rest of the elements in the subsequence. If such a subsequence exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
    #
    #Since the exact input values are not provided, the output state cannot be precisely determined without knowing the specific values of `t`, `n`, and `a` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The function also accepts an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the function determines and returns a specific value based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
