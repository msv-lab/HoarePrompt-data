Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Ron and Hermione. The logic in `func_1` does not properly handle the game's rules for optimal play. Specifically, the program does not simulate the alternating moves between Ron and Hermione and determine the winner based on these moves. Instead, it calculates the minimum distance from the starting node to the ends of the "array-like" tree and checks if this distance is odd or even to decide the winner, which is not a correct implementation of the game rules.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```

In this case, the tree is structured as an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and the stone starts at node `5`. The optimal strategy would involve moving the stone towards the center of the array. However, the current implementation incorrectly determines the winner based on the distance from the start node to the ends, which does not reflect the actual game dynamics.
