Based on the initial state provided:

- `empty` is `False`
- `t` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it doesn't affect the print statement)
- `u` and `v` are equal to `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)` respectively
- `n` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it doesn't affect the print statement)
- `tree` is a deque containing integers after processing all inputs with the integer `start` added to the end
- `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`
- Any move in `moves` is even (this does not affect the print statement)

The print statement is simply `print('Hermione')`.

Output: **Hermione**
