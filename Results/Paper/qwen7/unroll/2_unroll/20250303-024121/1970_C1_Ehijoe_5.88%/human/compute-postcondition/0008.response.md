Output State: **`empty` is False, `t` remains the same, `u` and `v` are equal to `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)` respectively, `n` remains the same, `tree` is a deque containing integers after processing all inputs with the integer `start` added to the end, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**

This means that the variable `moves` is now a list containing two elements: the first element is the minimum of `t` and `idx`, and the second element is the minimum of `t` and `n - idx - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
