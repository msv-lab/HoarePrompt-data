Output State: `empty` is False, `t` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are integers between 1 and `n` after each iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5, and `tree` is a deque object containing elements `u` and `v` based on the conditions provided in the loop. The `tree` deque will contain exactly `n` elements after the loop completes, with elements added based on whether `u` or `v` matches the first or last element of the deque.
