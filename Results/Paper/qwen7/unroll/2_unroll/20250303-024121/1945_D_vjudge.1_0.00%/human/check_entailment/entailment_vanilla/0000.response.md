Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Analysis
- **Objective**: Minimize the cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - To move from position `i` to position `j` (where `j < i`), Kirill pays `a_j` coins.
  - For each position `k` where `j < k < i`, Kirill pays `b_k` coins.
- **Constraints**:
  - The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and \(10^4\).
  - The size of the queue `n` and the maximum allowable final position `m` are between 1 and 200,000.
  - The values of `a_i` and `b_i` are between 1 and \(10^9\).

### Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
   - Reads and reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
   - Initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.
   - Iterates over the first `n - k` elements:
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it updates `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - Initializes `resultado` to infinity.
   - Iterates over the last `k` elements:
     - Updates `resultado` with the minimum cost of moving to any of these positions.
     - Adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Issues Identified
1. **Reversing Lists**: The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed before processing. This is incorrect because the problem states that Kirill should move to the left (smaller indices), not reverse the order.
2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost is flawed. It does not correctly account for the cost of moving through intermediate positions.
3. **Incorrect Final Cost Calculation**: The final cost calculation is not correctly implemented. It should consider the cumulative cost of moving through intermediate positions.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate from right to left (from the end of the queue to the start).
2. Maintain a running total of the cost of moving through intermediate positions.
3. Update the minimum cost for each position where Kirill can move to one of the first `m` positions.

### Corrected Program
```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize variables
    total_cost = 0
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate from right to left
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        total_cost += lista_B[i]
        if i + k <= n:
            min_cost = min(min_cost, total_cost + lista_A[i])
    
    print(min_cost)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

# Call the function to process the input
func_2()
```

### Conclusion
The original program has significant issues in both the logic and the implementation. The corrected approach addresses these issues and should work correctly according to the problem description.

**Correctness: **False**
