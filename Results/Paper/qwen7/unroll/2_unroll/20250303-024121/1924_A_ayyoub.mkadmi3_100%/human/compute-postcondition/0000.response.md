Output State: **`s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`.**

The code initializes `s1` as an empty string, which does not affect the values of `s`, `k`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
