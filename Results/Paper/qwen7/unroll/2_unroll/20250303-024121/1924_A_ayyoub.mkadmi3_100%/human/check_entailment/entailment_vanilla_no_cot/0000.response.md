To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze it step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - It constructs `s1` by keeping track of the characters seen so far.
   - It removes characters from `alphabet` as they are encountered in `s`.
   - If `alphabet` is reduced to a single character, it adds this character to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
   - It calculates `r` as the quotient of `len(s1)` divided by `k` and returns a tuple indicating if `s1` is long enough, and the substrings `s1[r*k:]` and `s2`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and checks the result.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "No" and generates a string of length `n` that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "Yes".

### Issues Identified:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be subsequences of `s`.
   - Specifically, it only checks if a single sequence of characters can be formed, but it does not ensure that all combinations of these characters can be subsequences.

2. **Generating Non-Subsequence String:**
   - The method to generate a non-subsequence string is flawed. It assumes that the first character not in `s1` will form a valid non-subsequence, which is not always true.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**False**
