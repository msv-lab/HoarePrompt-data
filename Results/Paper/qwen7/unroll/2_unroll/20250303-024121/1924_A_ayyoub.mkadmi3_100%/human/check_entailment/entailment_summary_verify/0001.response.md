### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Output List:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an output list `OUT` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.
   - It calls the function `func_1(s, k, n)` to process the string `s` and determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes the string `s` and checks if all characters from the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear in `s` at least `n` times.
   - It maintains two strings: `s1` and `s2`.
     - `s1` accumulates the characters from `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
     - `s2` accumulates the characters from `s` after `s1` has been filled up to `n * k` characters.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`, where:
     - `len(s1) >= n * k` checks if there are enough characters in `s1` to form all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
     - `s1[r * k:]` is the part of `s1` after the first `n * k` characters.
     - `s2` is the remaining part of `s` after processing `s1`.

4. **Determining the Result:**
   - If `len(s1) < n * k`, it means not all required characters are present in `s`, so it appends 'No' to `OUT` and constructs a string `be9i` of length `n` using the first character that is not in `s1`.
   - If `len(s1) >= n * k`, it appends 'Yes' to `OUT`.

5. **Printing Results:**
   - Finally, it prints the results stored in `OUT`.

#### Correctness Check:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly checks if there are enough characters in `s` to form all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - However, the function does not correctly handle the case where `s1` might not contain all necessary characters but still might have enough unique characters to form some valid subsequences.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` does not fully address the requirement to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as a subsequence.
   - The construction of `s2` and the logic to find a missing character are not fully aligned with the problem statement.

3. **Output Construction:**
   - The construction of `be9i` in the case of 'No' is not optimal and might not always provide a valid counterexample.

#### Detailed Issues:

- **Function `func_1` does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked.**
  - The function `func_1` only checks if there are enough characters in `s1` to form all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It does not verify if these characters are in the correct order to form all possible subsequences.
- **Construction of `be9i` is not optimal.**
  - The current implementation of `be9i` simply finds the first character not in `s1` and repeats it `n` times. This might not always provide a valid counterexample, as the required subsequence might involve a different combination of characters.

#### Conclusion:

Given the detailed issues identified, the provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as a subsequence of `s`.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
