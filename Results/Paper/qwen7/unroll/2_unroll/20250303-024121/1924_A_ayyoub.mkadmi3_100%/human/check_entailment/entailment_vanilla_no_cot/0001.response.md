Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - It constructs two strings: `s1` and `s2`.
     - `s1` accumulates characters from `s` that are within the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
     - `s2` accumulates characters from `s` after `s1` has been constructed.
   - It also maintains a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - If a character in `s` matches an element in `alphabet`, it removes that character from `alphabet` and appends it to `s1`. If `alphabet` becomes empty, it starts appending to `s2`.
   - After processing the string `s`, it checks if `s1` contains at least `n * k` characters.
   - If `s1` contains fewer than `n * k` characters, it returns `(False, s1, s2)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(True, s1[r * k:], s2)` where `r = len(s1) // k`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and checks the result.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "No" and generates a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.
     - It iterates through the ASCII values of lowercase English alphabets starting from `97` (which corresponds to 'a').
     - It finds the first character that is not in `s1` and constructs the required string.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "Yes".

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is mostly correct but has a flaw. Specifically, the removal of characters from `alphabet` might not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are checked.
   - The condition `if len(alphabet) != 1:` is unnecessary and might lead to incorrect results. Instead, we should focus on ensuring that all characters in `alphabet` are present in `s1`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic correctly handles the cases where `func_1` returns `False` and `True`.
   - However, the generation of the string in the case of `False` might not always produce a valid string that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem. The function `func_1` might not correctly identify all possible strings of length `n` as subsequences of `s`. Additionally, the generation of a non-subsequence string might not always work as intended.

**Correctness: False**
