The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a string `s`, a positive integer `k`, and another positive integer `n`. It processes `s` to create two strings, `s1` and `s2`. `s1` contains all characters from `s` that belong to the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, while `s2` contains a single character from `s` if there is exactly one character in the first `k` alphabets that is present in `s`. The function then calculates a value `r` based on the length of `s1` and returns a tuple consisting of a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`.
