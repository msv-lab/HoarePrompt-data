Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `a`.
3. It sorts the list of ticket prices `a` in ascending order.
4. It initializes variables `t` (to keep track of the cumulative increase in ticket prices), `s` (to store the number of tickets to be bought in the current iteration), and `c` (to store the total cost).
5. It then iterates through the sorted list of ticket prices, buying up to `m` tickets each day and adjusting the ticket prices accordingly.
6. The logic within the loop ensures that the minimum of `m` and `k` tickets are bought each day, and the ticket prices are updated based on the number of tickets bought.
7. Finally, it prints the total cost `c`.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to follow the rules and correctly calculates the minimum cost to purchase the required number of tickets.

Correctness: **True**
