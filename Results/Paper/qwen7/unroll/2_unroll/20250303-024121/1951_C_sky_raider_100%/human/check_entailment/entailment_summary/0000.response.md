Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of ticket prices, which is a valid approach to ensure that cheaper prices are considered first.
3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The variable `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`, ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are purchased in a single day.
   - The cumulative cost `c` is updated by adding the product of `s` and the current ticket price plus any accumulated increase `t`.
   - The variable `t` is incremented by `s` to account for the price increase for subsequent days.
   - The variable `k` is decremented by `s` to reflect the number of tickets already purchased.
4. **Output**: The program prints the total cost for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the provided execution summary and the detailed reasoning above, the program appears to follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
