Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets purchased on a given day affects the prices of subsequent days. Specifically, the program does not implement the rule that if a person purchases \(x\) tickets on day \(i\), the price per ticket for all subsequent days increases by \(x\).

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```

The correct approach would be:
- On the first day, you can buy up to 2 tickets. Buying 2 tickets on the first day would make the prices for the next days increase by 2, so the new prices would be [10, 8, 6].
- On the second day, buying 2 tickets again would make the prices for the next day increase by 4, so the new prices would be [14].
- Finally, buying 1 ticket on the third day would cost 6.

The total cost would be \(10 + 14 + 6 = 30\).

However, the provided program calculates the cost as:
- Buying 2 tickets on the first day: \(8 + 6 = 14\).
- Buying 2 tickets on the second day: \(4 + 2 = 6\).
- Buying 1 ticket on the third day: \(2\).

The total cost calculated by the program is \(14 + 6 + 2 = 22\).

This discrepancy shows that the program does not correctly implement the logic where the price per ticket increases for subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased on the current day. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
