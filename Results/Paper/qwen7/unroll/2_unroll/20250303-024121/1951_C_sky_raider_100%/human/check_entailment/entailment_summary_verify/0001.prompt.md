You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        t = 0
        s = 0
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            c += s * (l[i] + t)
            t += s
            k -= s
        print(int(c))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), along with a list of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers, then iterates through the list, calculating a cumulative sum based on the minimum of \( m \) and \( k \) for each element. This cumulative sum is adjusted by adding the current value of \( t \) and multiplied by the sorted list element. Finally, it prints the total sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Sorting**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case and sorts the list of ticket prices `l`. Sorting is necessary because we need to consider the cheapest days first to minimize the total cost.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized to 0. `t` keeps track of the cumulative increase in ticket prices due to previous purchases, `s` represents the number of tickets purchased on the current day, and `c` accumulates the total cost.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each day `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each day, it calculates the minimum number of tickets that can be purchased (`s = min(m, k)`). This ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought in a single day.
   - It then adds the cost of these tickets to the total cost (`c += s * (l[i] + t)`), where `l[i]` is the price of a ticket on day `i` and `t` is the cumulative increase in price due to previous purchases.
   - The cumulative increase in price `t` is updated by adding the number of tickets purchased on the current day (`t += s`).
   - The number of tickets left to be purchased is reduced by the number of tickets purchased on the current day (`k -= s`).

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all days, the total cost `c` is printed.

### Analysis:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It sorts the ticket prices to ensure that cheaper days are considered first, and it correctly handles the cumulative increase in ticket prices due to previous purchases. The main loop iterates through each day, purchasing the maximum possible number of tickets without exceeding the remaining tickets to be purchased.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the provided problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
