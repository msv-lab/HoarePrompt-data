Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the problem constraints and logic. Specifically, it does not account for the dynamic increase in ticket prices based on the number of tickets purchased on any given day. Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Price Increase**: The solution sorts the list of ticket prices and then tries to buy tickets in ascending order. This approach does not consider the dynamic increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a particular day.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Cost**: The solution calculates the total cost without properly reflecting the increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a given day. It simply adds the number of tickets purchased multiplied by the current price, which does not reflect the problem's constraints.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to implement a strategy that considers the dynamic nature of ticket prices and optimally buys tickets to minimize the total cost. One possible approach involves using a priority queue (or heap) to keep track of the best days to buy tickets while considering the price increases.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import heapq

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Use a min-heap to keep track of the best days to buy tickets
        heap = []
        for i, price in enumerate(a):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (price, i))
        
        total_cost = 0
        tickets_bought = 0
        day = 0
        
        while tickets_bought < k:
            price, i = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if i > day:
                # Calculate the number of tickets that can be bought on this day
                tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
                total_cost += tickets_to_buy * (price + day * tickets_to_buy)
                tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
                day = i
            else:
                # If the current day is already considered, push back to the heap
                heapq.heappush(heap, (price, i))
        
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected solution uses a priority queue to always consider the best day to buy tickets, taking into account the dynamic increase in ticket prices.
