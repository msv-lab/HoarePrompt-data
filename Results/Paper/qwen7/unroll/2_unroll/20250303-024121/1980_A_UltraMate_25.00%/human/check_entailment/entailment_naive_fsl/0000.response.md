Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the required number of problems for a specific difficulty level exceeds the total number of rounds `m`. Specifically, the program incorrectly adds `m` for each missing difficulty level, rather than ensuring that the total number of problems needed for each difficulty level does not exceed `m`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
7 2
ABCDEFGB
5 3
ABCDEFAB
4 1
ABCDEFAB
```

- For the first test case (`7 2 ABCDEFGB`), the program should output `1` because we need one 'G' and one 'C', but the program outputs `2`.
- For the second test case (`5 3 ABCDEFAB`), the program should output `3` because we need three 'A's, three 'B's, and one each of 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', but the program outputs `6`.
- For the third test case (`4 1 ABCDEFAB`), the program should output `2` because we need one 'A' and one 'B', but the program outputs `2`.

The program fails to ensure that the total number of problems needed for each difficulty level does not exceed `m`, leading to incorrect results.
