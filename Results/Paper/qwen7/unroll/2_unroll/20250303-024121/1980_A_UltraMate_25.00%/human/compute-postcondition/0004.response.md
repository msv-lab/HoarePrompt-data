Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5), and a string a consisting of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, it returns a specific output based on the given conditions.**
