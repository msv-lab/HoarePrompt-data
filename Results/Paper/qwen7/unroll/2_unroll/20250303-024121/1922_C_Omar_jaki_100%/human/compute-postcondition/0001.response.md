Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces; `t` is assigned the value of the first element from the input split by spaces.**

In this case, the code `t, = r()` assigns the value of the first element from the input (split by spaces) to the variable `t`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
