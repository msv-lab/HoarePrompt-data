Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene, who also plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.
2. The provided code reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the integers on the cards in your hand.
3. It then counts the occurrences of each integer using the `cnt` array.
4. The key logic in the code is the loop where it calculates the answer `ans`. For each count in `cnt`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans`. This logic is correct because:
   - If a number appears `x` times in your hand, you can contribute up to `x - 1` points (since Nene will always try to prevent you from scoring).
   - The `max(0, x - 1)` ensures that you only add points if you have more than one card of the same number.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the code correctly computes the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.

Correctness: **True**
