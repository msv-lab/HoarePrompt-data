Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program attempts to count the number of increasing pairs in a single pass but does not properly handle the splitting of the array into two subsequences to minimize the total penalty. The logic inside the loops is flawed and does not ensure that the array is optimally split into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\).

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to sort the array and then split it into two parts such that the penalty is minimized. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        sorted_l = sorted(l)
        
        # Calculate the penalty for the optimal split
        penalty = 0
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if sorted_l[i] < sorted_l[i + 1]:
                penalty += 1
        
        print(penalty)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution sorts the array and then calculates the penalty by counting the number of adjacent pairs that are in increasing order. This approach ensures that the array is optimally split into two subsequences to minimize the total penalty.
