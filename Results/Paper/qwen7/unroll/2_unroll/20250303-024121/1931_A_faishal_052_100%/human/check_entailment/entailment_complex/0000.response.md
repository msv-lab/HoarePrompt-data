Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and then processes each test case by reading the encoded integer (`lex`).

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `lex` by checking if it is less than 28, 52, or within the range of 28 to 78. This logic is flawed because it does not cover all possible values of `lex` and does not correctly handle the decoding process.
   - Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the decoding of `lex` by always appending 1 or 26 to the array `arr` without considering the correct division by 26 and the remainder. This leads to incorrect values being appended to `arr`.

3. **Sorting and Conversion**:
   - After appending the values to `arr`, the program sorts `arr` and then constructs a string from the first three elements of the sorted array. However, the sorting step is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correct solution.
   - The conversion of the elements to characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` is correct, but it should be applied to the correct elements derived from the proper decoding process.

4. **Correct Decoding Logic**:
   - To correctly decode the integer `lex`, we need to repeatedly divide `lex` by 26 and take the remainder to get the correct character indices.
   - We should append the remainder (plus 1) to the array `arr` and then subtract the product of the quotient and 26 from `lex`.

5. **Final String Construction**:
   - After constructing the array `arr` with the correct values, we can sort it and then convert the first three elements to characters to form the final string.

Given the above points, the current implementation is incorrect due to the flawed decoding logic. Therefore, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
