State: **`info` is a list of lists where each inner list contains four elements, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `cases`.
2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `cases`. Therefore, `cases` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
3. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 (the default starting value for `range(cases)`), but since the loop body is omitted, we assume the loop will start with `i` being 1 for the first iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute, which means `cases` must be greater than 0 and `i` should be set to 1 for the first iteration.
