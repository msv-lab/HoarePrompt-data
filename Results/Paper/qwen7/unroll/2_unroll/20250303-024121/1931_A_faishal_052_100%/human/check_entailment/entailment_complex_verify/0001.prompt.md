You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

    #State: Output State: `info` is a list of lists where each inner list contains four elements. The first two elements are either 1 or 26 depending on the value of `lex` after processing, and the last element is the remaining value of `lex` after it has been reduced by multiples of 26 or 1. Each inner list is sorted. The exact contents of `info` depend on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: Output State: After executing the loop, the output state will consist of a series of strings printed to the console. Each string is formed by converting the third element of each inner list in `info` (after reducing `lex` by multiples of 26 or 1) into characters using the formula `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `cases-1` and `j` ranges from `0` to `2`. These characters are then concatenated to form a string for each iteration of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, where each case consists of an integer `lex`. For each case, it processes `lex` to determine its value relative to 28 and 52, appends the result to a list, sorts the list, and then converts specific elements of the list into characters. It prints a series of strings formed by these characters for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex`, which represents the encoded value of the word.

2. **Decoding the Encoded Value:**
   - The program attempts to decode the encoded value into a list of integers representing the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - It uses a series of conditional checks to assign values to the list `arr`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `lex` is less than 28, it assigns 1 to the first element of `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 28 and 52, it assigns 26 to the first element of `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it again assigns 26 to the first element of `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - Finally, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.

4. **Sorting and Converting to Characters:**
   - The list `arr` is sorted.
   - Each element in `arr` is converted to the corresponding character using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` and concatenated to form the final word.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Encoded Values:**
   - The logic for assigning values to `arr` is flawed. Specifically, the conditions do not correctly handle the range of possible encoded values.
   - For example, if `lex` is between 28 and 52, it should assign 26 to the second element of `arr` and subtract 26 from `lex`, but the current logic incorrectly assigns 26 to the first element.

2. **Sorting Before Conversion:**
   - Sorting `arr` before converting it to characters can lead to incorrect results. The original order of the elements is important for determining the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program does not handle the edge case where `lex` is exactly 28, 52, or 78 correctly.

### Corrected Approach:

To correctly decode the encoded value and find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to:
1. Determine the possible values for the first two letters.
2. Assign the remaining value to the third letter.
3. Ensure the resulting word is lexicographically smallest.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Determine the possible values for the first two letters
        if lex >= 78:
            first = 26
            second = 26
            third = lex - 52
        elif lex >= 52:
            first = 26
            second = lex - 26
            third = 1
        else:
            first = lex // 26
            second = lex % 26
            third = 1
        
        # Convert the values to characters
        first_char = chr(first + 96)
        second_char = chr(second + 96)
        third_char = chr(third + 96)
        
        print(first_char + second_char + third_char)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for handling the encoded values and the incorrect sorting approach. The corrected program above should provide the correct lexicographically smallest word for each test case.
