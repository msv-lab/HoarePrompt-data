Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, where each case consists of an integer `lex`. For each case, it processes `lex` to determine its value relative to 28 and 52, appends the result to a list, sorts the list, and then converts specific elements of the list into characters. It prints a series of strings formed by these characters for each test case.**
