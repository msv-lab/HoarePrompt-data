Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Length:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total length of the numbers by converting each number to a string and summing their lengths. This is correct.
   - However, the subsequent logic to subtract the zero counts (`cntvals`) is not relevant to the game rules and does not accurately reflect the game dynamics.

2. **Zero Count Function:**
   - The `zerocnts` function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number. While this might seem useful, it is not directly related to the game rules. The game involves reversing digits and concatenating numbers, not counting trailing zeros.

3. **Game Logic Misunderstanding:**
   - The game alternates between Anna and Sasha, with specific moves defined for each player. The provided code does not simulate these moves or determine the winner based on the optimal strategy.
   - The logic to check if the total length is greater than or equal to \(10^m\) is also misplaced. It should be part of the evaluation of the final state after all moves are made, not during the process of calculating the total length.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the game and determine the winner based on the optimal moves. Here’s a more appropriate approach:

1. **Simulate Moves:**
   - Simulate Anna’s move of reversing digits.
   - Simulate Sasha’s move of concatenating two numbers.
   - Continue until Sasha cannot make a move.

2. **Determine Winner:**
   - Check if the remaining number is at least \(10^m\).

Here is a revised version of the solution:

```python
def reverse_digits(num):
    return int(str(num)[::-1])

def can_concatenate(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            return True
    return False

def game_winner(t, m, nums):
    while can_concatenate(nums):
        # Anna's move: Reverse digits
        nums = [reverse_digits(num) for num in nums]
        
        # Sasha's move: Concatenate two numbers
        while can_concatenate(nums):
            i, j = 0, 1
            while j < len(nums):
                nums.append(int(f"{nums[i]}{nums[j]}"))
                del nums[i], nums[j]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
                j = i + 1
    
    # Check if the remaining number is at least 10^m
    remaining_num = nums[0]
    return "Sasha" if remaining_num >= 10**m else "Anna"

# Example usage:
t = 1
m = 2
nums = [14, 2]
print(game_winner(t, m, nums))  # Output: Sasha
```

This approach correctly simulates the game and determines the winner based on the optimal strategy.
