### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function `zerocnts`**:
   - This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of a number.
   - However, as mentioned in the original assessment, this information is not directly relevant to determining the winner of the game. The game's outcome depends on the total length of the numbers after reversals and concatenations.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function attempts to calculate the total length of the numbers after reversals and then determines the winner based on this length.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not simulate the actual game turns and the optimal strategies of both players. It simply sums the lengths of the numbers after reversing them, which does not reflect the game's rules where players take turns and modify the list accordingly.
   - The function also does not handle the condition where Sasha wins if the remaining number is at least \(10^m\).

To correctly implement the game logic, we need to simulate the turns and ensure that the game progresses according to the rules. The provided functions do not achieve this.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions do not correctly implement the game logic and do not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
