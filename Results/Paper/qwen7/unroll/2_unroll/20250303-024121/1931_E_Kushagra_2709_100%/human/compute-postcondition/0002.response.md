Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.
   - The loop also uses the variable `num`, which is a string representation of an integer.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `len(num) - 1`.
   - This means `i` will initially be the length of the string `num` minus one.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, `i` must be initialized to a value that satisfies this condition.

4. **Initial State of `num`:**
   - `num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 10^9\).
   - This means `num` can be any string from "1" to "999999999".

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is initialized to `len(num) - 1`, and `len(num)` is always non-negative, `i` will be non-negative as long as `num` is a non-empty string.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `num` is a non-empty string.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `num` must be a non-empty string.
- `i` must be initialized to `len(num) - 1`.

Putting it all together:

State: **`num` is a non-empty string, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
