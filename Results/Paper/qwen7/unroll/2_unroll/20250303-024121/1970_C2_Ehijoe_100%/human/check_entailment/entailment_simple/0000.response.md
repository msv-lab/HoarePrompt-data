### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem involves a game played on a tree structure with \( n \) nodes. The game consists of \( t \) rounds, where each round starts with a stone on a specific node, and players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor node. The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The goal is to determine the winner of each round, assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Tree Representation**: The tree is represented using an adjacency list (`nodes`), where each node points to its neighbors.
   - **Recursive Function (`func_1`)**: This function checks if a node can force a win in the current position. It does this by recursively checking if any of its neighbors can be forced into a losing position.
   - **Main Function (`func_2`)**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, identifies the leaf nodes, and determines the winner based on the recursive check.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if a node can force a win. It uses a recursive approach to check if any of its neighbors can be forced into a losing position.
   - The base case is when a node has only one neighbor (itself), in which case it cannot force a win.
   - For other nodes, it checks if any of its neighbors can be forced into a losing position. If at least one neighbor can be forced into a losing position, the current node can force a win.

4. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes the input, constructs the tree, and identifies the leaf nodes.
   - It then calls `func_1` to determine if the starting node can force a win.
   - Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints "Ron" if the starting node can force a win, and "Hermione" otherwise.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and constructs the tree.
   - The recursive function `func_1` correctly determines if a node can force a win.
   - The main function `func_2` correctly uses the result of `func_1` to determine the winner.
