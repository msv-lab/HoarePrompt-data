The function accepts four parameters: `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates and returns the value of the expression `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` based on these inputs. The expression represents a computation involving the integers `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `k` is constrained by `0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)`, `n` is the total number of buns, `a` is the usual price of a bun, and `b` is the price of the first bun sold at a modified price.
