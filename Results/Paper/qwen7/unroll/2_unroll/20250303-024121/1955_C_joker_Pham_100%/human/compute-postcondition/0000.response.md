Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n; l is 0; r is n - 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `l` and `r`. `l` is set to 0, and `r` is set to `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
