Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem statement.
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function correctly reads a line of space-separated integers and returns a map object. However, the map object should be converted to a list before being used in further operations. This is a minor issue but does not affect the overall correctness of the logic.
3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function calculates the sum of the first elements of the tuples in `primary_items` for which the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` is true. This logic is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.
4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function processes each test case as follows:
   - It initializes necessary variables and constructs the `combined` list of tuples.
   - It uses a heap to manage the items and strategically combines negative prices (from Alice) and bonuses (from Bob) to maximize Alice's profit.
   - The logic to update the maximum profit is correct and follows the optimal strategy described in the problem.

Given the above analysis, the overall logic of the program is correct and meets the problem requirements. The minor issue with Function 2 (not converting the map object to a list) does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Correctness: **True**
