Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, and `results` is a list containing strings where each string is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop. The loop simply prints each string in the `results` list without changing its contents. Therefore, the `results` list remains unchanged after the loop executes all the iterations.
