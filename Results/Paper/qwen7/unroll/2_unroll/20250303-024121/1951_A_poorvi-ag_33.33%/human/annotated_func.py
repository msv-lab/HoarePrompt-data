def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        
        if arr.count('1') % 2 == 0:
            if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
                results.append('no')
            else:

    #State: Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, and `results` is a list containing strings with either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop. The length of the `results` list is equal to the value of `t`. For each input `n` and string `arr`, if `arr` contains exactly two '1's and includes the substring '11', the corresponding result is 'no'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's (and does not meet the first condition), the result is 'yes'. Otherwise, the result is 'no'.
    for r in results:
        print(r)
        
    #State: Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, and `results` is a list containing strings where each string is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop. The loop simply prints each string in the `results` list without changing its contents. Therefore, the `results` list remains unchanged after the loop executes all the iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a binary string `arr`. It checks if the string `arr` meets specific conditions related to the count of '1's in the string. Based on these conditions, it appends 'yes' or 'no' to a results list. Finally, it prints each element in the results list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything, but it modifies a list of results based on the input strings.
