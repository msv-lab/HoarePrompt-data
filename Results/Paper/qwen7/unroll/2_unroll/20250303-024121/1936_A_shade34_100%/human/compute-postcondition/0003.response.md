Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and interacts with an external entity to perform queries and receive responses. It aims to find a pair of indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of elements at these indices (p_i âŠ• p_j) is maximized, by making at most 3n queries where n is the length of the permutation.**

This means the function does not take any input parameters directly but instead relies on an external source to provide information about a fixed but unknown permutation. The goal is to identify two indices within this permutation where the result of their bitwise XOR operation is the largest possible value, through a limited number of queries.
