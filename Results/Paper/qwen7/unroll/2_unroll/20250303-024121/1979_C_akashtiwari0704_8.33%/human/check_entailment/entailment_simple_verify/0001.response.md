### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, we get \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) coins back.
   - The goal is to find a distribution of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution calculates the product of all multipliers \(a_i\) and then divides this product by each individual multiplier to get the corresponding bet value.
   - It then sums up these bet values and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to the product. If it is, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - If the sum is less than the product, it prints the calculated bet values.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - Let's consider the logic:
     - If the product of all multipliers is \(P = a_1 \times a_2 \times \cdots \times a_n\).
     - The bet for the \(i\)-th outcome is \(b_i = \frac{P}{a_i}\).
     - The total bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i = P \left( \frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{a_n} \right)\).
     - For the solution to work, we need \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i < P\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all multipliers are the same, say \(k\), then \(P = k^n\) and \(b_i = \frac{k^n}{k} = k^{n-1}\). The sum of bets would be \(n \times k^{n-1}\), which is always less than \(k^n\) for \(k > 1\).
   - If the multipliers are different, the sum of the reciprocals of the multipliers should be checked against 1. If the sum is greater than or equal to 1, then the total bet would not be less than the product.

5. **Validation:**
   - The solution correctly handles the edge case where the sum of the reciprocals is greater than or equal to 1, ensuring that the total bet is not less than the product.
   - However, the solution has a critical flaw. The calculation of the product \(P\) and the subsequent division to get the bets might lead to incorrect results due to integer division. Specifically, if the product \(P\) is large, the division \(\frac{P}{a_i}\) might result in a smaller value than expected, leading to an incorrect total bet sum.

6. **Example to Illustrate the Flaw:**
   - Consider the test case: \(n = 3\), \(k = [5, 5, 5]\).
     - \(P = 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\).
     - \(b_1 = \frac{125}{5} = 25\), \(b_2 = \frac{125}{5} = 25\), \(b_3 = \frac{125}{5} = 25\).
     - Total bet = \(25 + 25 + 25 = 75\).
     - Since \(75 < 125\), the solution incorrectly prints the bets instead of `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it uses integer division, which can lead to incorrect results for large products. The solution should use floating-point division to ensure accurate calculations.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final:
