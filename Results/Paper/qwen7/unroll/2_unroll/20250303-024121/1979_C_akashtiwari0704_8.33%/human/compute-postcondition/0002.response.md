Output State: **After executing the loop, `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration, `bets` and `a` will be updated based on the calculations inside the loop, and `prod` and `sumo` will be recalculated for each test case. The final output will consist of either -1 or a space-separated list of integers for each test case, with `t` representing the number of such outputs.**
