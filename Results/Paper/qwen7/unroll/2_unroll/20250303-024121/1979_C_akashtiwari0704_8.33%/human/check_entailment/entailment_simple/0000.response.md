Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`bets`) and the multipliers (`k`).

2. **Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`). This step is necessary to ensure that the total bet is compared against the potential winnings in a consistent manner.

3. **Bet Calculation**: For each outcome, the program calculates the bet amount as `prod // a[i]`. This calculation is based on the requirement that the total bet should be less than the potential winnings for any outcome.

4. **Sum Calculation**: The program sums up all the calculated bet amounts (`sumo`).

5. **Validation**: The program checks if the sum of bets (`sumo`) is greater than or equal to the product (`prod`). If it is, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution of bets exists. Otherwise, it prints the calculated bets.

6. **Output Formatting**: The program formats the output as a space-separated list of integers for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic in the program appears to be correct. It correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem, including the constraints and the requirement to distribute the bets in a way that ensures coming out ahead for any winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
