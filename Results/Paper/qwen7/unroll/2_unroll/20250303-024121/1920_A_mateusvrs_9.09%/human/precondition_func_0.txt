t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. There are n lines describing the constraints, where each line contains two integers a and x such that a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The constraints guarantee that there is a finite number of integers satisfying all constraints, and no two constraints are the same.
