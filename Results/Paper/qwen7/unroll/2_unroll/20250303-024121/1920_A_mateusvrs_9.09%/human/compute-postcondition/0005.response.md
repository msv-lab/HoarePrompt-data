Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
- `r` is a list containing integers where each integer is either 0 or a positive value representing the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` adjusted by subtracting the count of such elements from `(ax - bx + 1)`.

The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line. Since the exact values of `cx`, `bx`, and `ax` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `r`. However, we know that each element in `r` is either 0 or a positive value derived from the conditions described.

Therefore, the output will be a series of lines, each containing one of the elements of the list `r`.

Output: **0 or a positive value (each on a new line, where each value is derived from the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` adjusted by subtracting the count of such elements from `(ax - bx + 1)`)**
