You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of constraints defined by pairs of integers (a, x). It calculates and returns a list of integers. For each test case, it determines the count of integers in a set that fall within a specified range [bx, ax], adjusted by subtracting the count of such integers from (ax - bx + 1). If no integers fall within the range [bx, ax], it returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to some integer x). Specifically, the program only checks if the value of `x` from a type 3 constraint falls within the range `[bx, ax]`, but it does not account for the fact that `k` cannot be equal to any of the values in the set `cx`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```

According to the problem description, the constraints are:
1. \( k \geq 3 \)
2. \( k \leq 10 \)
3. \( k \neq 1 \)
4. \( k \neq 5 \)

The program calculates `bx = 3` and `ax = 10`. The set `cx` contains `{1, 5}`. The program then checks if these values fall within the range `[3, 10]` and finds that both 1 and 5 do fall within this range. Therefore, the program incorrectly subtracts 2 from the total range, resulting in `10 - 3 + 1 - 2 = 6` possible values for `k`.

However, the correct answer should exclude both 1 and 5, so the correct number of possible values for `k` is `7` (i.e., 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly handles all values in the set `cx` and excludes them from the range `[bx, ax]`.
