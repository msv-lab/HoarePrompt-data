Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A set `cx` is used to store values that `k` should not be equal to.
   - Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to handle the range of valid `k` values. `ax` is initialized to a large value (10^9 + 7), and `bx` is initialized to -1.

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program checks the type (`a`) and updates `ax` and `bx` accordingly:
     - If `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `bx`. This ensures that `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `ax`. This ensures that `k` must be less than or equal to `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx`. This ensures that `k` cannot be equal to `x`.

4. **Checking Valid Range:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If true, it means there is no valid range for `k`, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of invalid values in `cx` from the total range (`ax - bx + 1`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Check

1. **Handling Constraints:**
   - The logic for updating `ax` and `bx` correctly handles the constraints of type 1 and 2.
   - The set `cx` correctly stores the values that `k` should not be equal to.

2. **Range Calculation:**
   - The calculation of the valid range (`ax - bx + 1`) and the adjustment for invalid values in `cx` is correct.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `bx >= ax`, resulting in an empty valid range.

4. **Guarantees:**
   - The problem guarantees that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, ensuring that `bx` and `ax` will always be valid for the range check.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**
