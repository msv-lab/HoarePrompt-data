Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables `t` to read the number of test cases, and lists and sets to store the constraints and relevant values.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store values that `k` should not be equal to.
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value and `bx` to -1 to keep track of the upper and lower bounds of valid `k` values.
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Validation and Calculation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it means there are no valid `k` values, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of invalid values in `cx` from the total range `(ax - bx + 1)`.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The logic handles all the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem statement, ensuring the solution is correct.
