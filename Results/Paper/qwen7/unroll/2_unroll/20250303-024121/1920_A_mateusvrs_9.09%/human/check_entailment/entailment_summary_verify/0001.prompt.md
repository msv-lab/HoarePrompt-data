You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):

            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx >= ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of constraints defined by pairs of integers (a, x). It calculates and returns a list of integers. For each test case, it determines the count of integers in a set that fall within a specified range [bx, ax], adjusted by subtracting the count of such integers from (ax - bx + 1). If no integers fall within the range [bx, ax], it returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A set `cx` is used to store values that `k` should not be equal to.
   - Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to handle the range of valid `k` values. `ax` is initialized to a large value (10^9 + 7), and `bx` is initialized to -1.

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program checks the type (`a`) and updates `ax` and `bx` accordingly:
     - If `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `bx`. This ensures that `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `ax`. This ensures that `k` must be less than or equal to `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx`. This ensures that `k` cannot be equal to `x`.

4. **Checking Valid Range:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If true, it means there is no valid range for `k`, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of invalid values in `cx` from the total range (`ax - bx + 1`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Check

1. **Handling Constraints:**
   - The logic for updating `ax` and `bx` correctly handles the constraints of type 1 and 2.
   - The set `cx` correctly stores the values that `k` should not be equal to.

2. **Range Calculation:**
   - The calculation of the valid range (`ax - bx + 1`) and the adjustment for invalid values in `cx` is correct.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `bx >= ax`, resulting in an empty valid range.

4. **Guarantees:**
   - The problem guarantees that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, ensuring that `bx` and `ax` will always be valid for the range check.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
