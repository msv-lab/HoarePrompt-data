Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and initializes an empty list `r` to store results.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`n`), and initializes variables `ax` and `bx` to represent the bounds of the valid range for `k`.
3. It uses a set `cx` to store values of `x` for the "not equal" constraints (a=3).
4. It iterates over each constraint, updating `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` accordingly:
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.
5. After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to `r` because no valid `k` can exist.
6. Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx` and appends this value to `r`.
7. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
