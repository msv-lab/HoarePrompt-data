You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 50) followed by \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (0 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 99). For each test case, it checks if rearranging any adjacent pair of elements can make the sequence non-decreasing. If such a rearrangement is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function implicitly uses the value of \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^3) from the input structure but does not return it.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself.
   
2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning.
   - For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if the current element (`arr[i]`) is less than the previous element (`arr[i-1]`).
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, it splits `arr[i-1]` into its individual digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted.
   - If the list of digits is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates `arr[i-1]` with the first digit of the sorted list.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints "NO" if `ans` is `False`, otherwise it prints "YES".

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Sorting:**
   - The logic for checking if the digits of `arr[i-1]` plus `arr[i]` can be sorted is flawed.
   - The program assumes that splitting `arr[i-1]` and appending `arr[i]` will always result in a sorted sequence, which is not necessarily true.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program would split `45` into `[4, 5]` and append `67`, but this does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will be sorted.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Digits:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits.
   - It only checks if the combined list of digits is sorted, but it does not ensure that the original array can be transformed into a sorted array through the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
