Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and now `n` holds the value of the integer input. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^3 is still valid. The value of `n` is constrained to be between 2 and 50 as per the input requirements.
