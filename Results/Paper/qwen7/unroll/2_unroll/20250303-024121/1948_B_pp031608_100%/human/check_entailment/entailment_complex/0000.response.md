Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function `func()`.
- The function processes each test case as follows:
  1. It reads the number of elements `m` in the array.
  2. It reads the array `arr` of `m` integers.
  3. It iterates backward through the array starting from the second last element.
  4. For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if swapping them (by splitting the larger element into its digits and checking if the resulting list is sorted) would make the array non-decreasing.
  5. If it finds a pair that cannot be made non-decreasing, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
  6. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True`, indicating the array can be made non-decreasing, or 'NO' if `ans` is `False`.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the array non-decreasing by performing the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
