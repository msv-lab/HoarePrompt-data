The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), consisting of only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down. The function checks if the string `s` can be balanced (i.e., if it's possible to flip some coins so that all "U"s become "D"s and all "D"s become "U"s, making the string uniform). If it can be balanced, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return 'YES' if the string can be balanced, otherwise it returns 'NO'.
