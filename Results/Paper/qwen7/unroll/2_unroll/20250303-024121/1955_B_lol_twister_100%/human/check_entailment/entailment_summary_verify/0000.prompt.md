You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \)), two integers \( c \) and \( d \) (where \( 1 \leq c, d \leq 10^6 \)), and a list \( l \) of \( n^2 \) integers (each integer in the range [1, \( 10^9 \)]). It calculates a new list \( li \) where each element is formed by adding the minimum value of \( l \) to a linear combination of indices \( k \) and \( h \) scaled by \( c \) and \( d \). Both \( l \) and \( li \) are then sorted. If the sorted lists \( l \) and \( li \) are identical, the function returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the given array `l` can form a progressive square. Specifically, the program calculates the expected values for a progressive square but does not check if the given array `l` contains exactly those values without duplicates.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program generates the expected values and checks if they match the sorted input array, but it does not account for the fact that the input array might contain duplicate values. In the example, the array `[3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 10, 4, 8]` contains all the expected values without any duplicates, so it should be considered valid. However, the program incorrectly sorts and compares the arrays, leading to a mismatch due to the sorting process.

A correct implementation would involve checking if the input array contains exactly the expected values without duplicates. This can be achieved by generating the expected values, sorting both the expected and input arrays, and then comparing them element-wise.
