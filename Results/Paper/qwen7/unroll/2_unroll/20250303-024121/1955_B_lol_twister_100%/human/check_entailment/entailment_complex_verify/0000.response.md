### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, `c`, and `d`, followed by a list of `n^2` integers `l`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` as parameters.
   - It calculates the minimum value `a` from the list `l`.
   - It generates a list `li` containing the expected values of a progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each combination of `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - Both `l` and `li` are sorted.
   - The function then checks if `l` and `li` are equal and returns 'yes' if they are, otherwise 'no'.

#### Annotated Code:
- The annotated code provides a detailed breakdown of the program's state before and after the function call.
- The function `func_1` is correctly described as generating the expected values and then comparing them with the sorted input list.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The original assessment states that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the given array `l` can form a progressive square. Specifically, it mentions that the program does not account for the fact that the input array might contain duplicate values.
- The original assessment suggests that a correct implementation would involve checking if the input array contains exactly the expected values without duplicates.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- The program generates the expected values correctly using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`.
- The program sorts both the expected values (`li`) and the input array (`l`).
- The program then checks if the sorted lists are equal.
- The sorting step ensures that even if the input array contains duplicates, the comparison will still work correctly because the duplicates will be placed in the same positions in the sorted list.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly generates the expected values and checks if the input array matches these values when sorted. The sorting step ensures that the comparison works correctly even if the input array contains duplicates.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program does correctly implement the logic required to verify if the given array `l` can form a progressive square. The sorting step ensures that the comparison works correctly even if the input array contains duplicates.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
