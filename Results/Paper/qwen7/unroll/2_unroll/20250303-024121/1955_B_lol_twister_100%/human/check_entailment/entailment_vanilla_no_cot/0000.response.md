Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. The logic to generate the progressive square is flawed because it does not correctly account for the progression pattern across the entire \( n \times n \) matrix. Specifically, the current implementation only considers the smallest element `a` and generates a sequence based on row and column indices without ensuring the correct values for each cell in the matrix.

To fix this, the function should correctly generate the progressive square using the formula \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \) for each cell in the matrix. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    # Find the minimum value in the list to use as a starting point
    a = min(l)
    
    # Generate the correct progressive square
    li = [a + (i * c + j * d) for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
    
    # Sort both lists to compare them
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    
    # Check if the generated list matches the input list
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'
```

This corrected function ensures that the generated progressive square is constructed correctly and then compared with the input list.
