### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to verify if the given array `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. A progressive square is defined such that each element can be calculated using the formula \(a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d` and the array `l`.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, c, d, l)` to check if the array `l` can form a progressive square.
   - In `func_1`, the minimum value in `l` is identified as `a_{1,1}`.
   - A list `li` is generated containing all possible values of the progressive square using the formula \(a + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\) for all positions in the \(n \times n\) matrix.
   - Both `l` and `li` are sorted and compared. If they match, it means the array `l` can form a progressive square, and "yes" is returned; otherwise, "no" is returned.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the starting value (`a_{1,1}`) and generates all possible values of the progressive square.
   - Sorting both lists ensures that the order of elements is irrelevant, only their presence and correctness matter.
   - The comparison of sorted lists correctly determines if the array `l` can form a progressive square.

However, there is a critical flaw in the approach used to generate the list `li`. The code assumes that the minimum value in `l` is always `a_{1,1}`, but this is not necessarily true. The minimum value in `l` might not correspond to the top-left corner of the progressive square.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- \( n = 3 \), \( c = 2 \), \( d = 3 \)
- Array `l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

If we assume the minimum value in `l` is `a_{1,1}`, the generated list `li` would be:
\[ [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11] \]

This list does not match the expected progressive square:
\[ \begin{matrix}
1 & 3 & 5 \\
2 & 4 & 6 \\
7 & 9 & 11 \\
\end{matrix} \]

Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect because the code incorrectly assumes that the minimum value in `l` is `a_{1,1}` without verifying its position in the progressive square.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
