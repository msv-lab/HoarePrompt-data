Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `a` is the minimum value from the list `l`, `li` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for each combination of `k` and `h` in the range of 0 to n-1, `li` is not sorted, `l` is sorted.
