Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `k` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `k`**: The loop starts with `k` set to 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than `n`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `k` is between 0 and `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - `k` should be initialized to 0.
   - `n` should be within the given range (2 ≤ n ≤ 500).

Since the other variables (`c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, and `li`) are not involved in the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` being 0 and `n` being within the specified range.

**State: **`k` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500**
