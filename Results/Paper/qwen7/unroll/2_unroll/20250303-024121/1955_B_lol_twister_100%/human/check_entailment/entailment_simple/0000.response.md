Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies the minimum value `a` from the list `l`.
2. It then generates a list `li` containing all possible values of a progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each combination of `k` and `h` in the range of 0 to n-1.
3. Both `li` and `l` are sorted before comparison.
4. If the sorted `li` matches the sorted `l`, it returns 'yes', indicating that the elements in `l` can form a progressive square.
5. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

Given the problem description and the provided execution states, the logic implemented in the `func_1` function appears to be correct. The function correctly checks whether the given list `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.

Correctness: **True**
