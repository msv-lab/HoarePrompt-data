Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the given array `l` can form a progressive square. Specifically, the program calculates the expected values for a progressive square but does not check if the given array `l` contains exactly those values without duplicates.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program generates the expected values and checks if they match the sorted input array, but it does not account for the fact that the input array might contain duplicate values. In the example, the array `[3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 10, 4, 8]` contains all the expected values without any duplicates, so it should be considered valid. However, the program incorrectly sorts and compares the arrays, leading to a mismatch due to the sorting process.

A correct implementation would involve checking if the input array contains exactly the expected values without duplicates. This can be achieved by generating the expected values, sorting both the expected and input arrays, and then comparing them element-wise.
