Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters (n, m, k, d), where n, m, k, and d are integers with specific constraints. It also accepts a list named rows containing n lists, each of which contains m positive integers, with the first and last elements of each inner list being 0. The function returns a value based on the input parameters and the structure of the rows list.**

- `n` is the number of rows.
- `m` is the number of columns.
- `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
- `d` is an integer satisfying \(3 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq d \leq m\).
- `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers, and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0.
