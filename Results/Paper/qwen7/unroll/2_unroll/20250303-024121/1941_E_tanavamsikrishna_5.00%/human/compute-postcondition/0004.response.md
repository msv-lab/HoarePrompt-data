Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
3. **Initial state before the loop**: 
   - `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each corresponding row in `rows`.
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original integer values with the given constraints.
   - `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers.
   - `total_costs` is an empty list.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is such that the loop can start executing. Specifically, `i` should be 0 initially because the loop starts from the beginning of the `costs` list.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means setting `i` to 0.

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each corresponding row in `rows`.
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original integer values with the given constraints.
- `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers.
- `total_costs` is an empty list.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each corresponding row in `rows`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original integer values with the given constraints, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers, `total_costs` is an empty list**.
