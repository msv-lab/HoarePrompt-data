Output State: **`costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each corresponding row in `rows`; `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original integer values with the constraints 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 3 ≤ `m` ≤ 2 × 10^5, and 1 ≤ `d` ≤ `m`; `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers.**

This means that the `costs` list has been created by applying the function `func_1` to each row in the `rows` list, using the value of `d` for each application. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged and still satisfy their respective constraints. The `rows` list remains intact, consisting of `n` lists of integers.
