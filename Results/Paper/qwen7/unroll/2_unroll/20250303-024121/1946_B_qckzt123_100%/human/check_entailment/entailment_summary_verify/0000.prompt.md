You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( T \) (1 ≤ \( T \) ≤ 10^4), two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \) (1 ≤ \( n \), \( k \) ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the sum of \( n \) and \( k \) for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers (each integer \( a_i \) satisfies -10^9 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates a value \( ans \) based on the sum of \( a \), the maximum subarray sum starting from any point, and the value of \( k \), then prints the result modulo \( MOD \) (1000000007). The function reads inputs from standard input and outputs results to standard output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after performing k operations. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the sum `s` of the array and calculates the maximum prefix sum `t`. This is done using Kadane's algorithm, which finds the maximum subarray sum starting from the beginning of the array.

2. **First Operation**: The initial sum `s` plus the maximum prefix sum `t` gives the best possible sum after the first operation.

3. **Subsequent Operations**: For each subsequent operation, the program doubles the current maximum prefix sum `t` and adds it to the result. This is valid because adding the sum of a subarray multiple times effectively increases the overall sum of the array.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large sums.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to produce the correct result. Therefore, the program is correct.
