Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( T \).
2. For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and the array \( a \).
3. It calculates the initial sum of the array \( s \).
4. It finds the maximum subarray sum starting from any point (non-negative subarray sum) using Kadane's algorithm.
5. It initializes \( ans \) with the sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum.
6. It then iteratively doubles the maximum subarray sum (starting from 0) up to \( k-1 \) times and adds these values to \( ans \) modulo \( MOD \).

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the logic implemented in the program matches the requirements. Specifically:
- The program handles multiple test cases as required.
- It correctly computes the sum of the array and the maximum subarray sum.
- It correctly applies the doubling operation for the number of operations \( k \).
- The final result is printed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Therefore, the program appears to be correct according to the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
