The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( T \) (1 ≤ \( T \) ≤ 10^4), two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \) (1 ≤ \( n \), \( k \) ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the sum of \( n \) and \( k \) for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers (each integer \( a_i \) satisfies -10^9 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates a value \( ans \) based on the sum of \( a \), the maximum subarray sum starting from any point, and the value of \( k \), then prints the result modulo \( MOD \) (1000000007). The function reads inputs from standard input and outputs results to standard output.
