Output State: T is an integer indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, the variables are in the following state after the loop executes:

- `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`.
- `k` is an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.
- `t` is the maximum subarray sum (including subarrays that can be formed by taking some prefix and suffix of the array).
- `tmp` is a temporary variable used to calculate the maximum subarray sum.
- `ans` is the final answer calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, adjusted by multiplying `t` by `2^(k-1)` and taking modulo `1000000007`.

The loop processes each test case independently, and the final value of `ans` for each test case is printed. The other variables (`T`, `MOD`) remain unchanged.
