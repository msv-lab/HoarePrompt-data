Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after performing k operations. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the sum `s` of the array and calculates the maximum prefix sum `t`. This is done using Kadane's algorithm, which finds the maximum subarray sum starting from the beginning of the array.

2. **First Operation**: The initial sum `s` plus the maximum prefix sum `t` gives the best possible sum after the first operation.

3. **Subsequent Operations**: For each subsequent operation, the program doubles the current maximum prefix sum `t` and adds it to the result. This is valid because adding the sum of a subarray multiple times effectively increases the overall sum of the array.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large sums.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to produce the correct result. Therefore, the program is correct.
