Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining which letter ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in a series of input strings.
- The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), iterates through each test case, and counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
- For each string, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' and prints the more frequent letter.
- The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.
- There are no logical errors or omissions in the program that would lead to incorrect results based on the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
