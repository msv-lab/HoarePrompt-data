Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and initializes `sum_f` to accumulate the sum of friendship values.

2. **Summing Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly sums up the friendship values for all given pairs of friends.

3. **Calculating Expected Value**:
   - The formula used to calculate `p` and `q` is based on the expected increase in friendship values due to the excursions.
   - `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2` calculates the total number of unique pairs of children.
   - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` accounts for the expected increase in friendship values considering both the initial values and the additional increments due to repeated selections.
   - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2` represents the denominator, which is the total number of ways to choose pairs without considering the friendship values.

4. **Simplifying the Fraction**:
   - The program uses `math.gcd` to simplify the fraction by dividing `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor.

5. **Modular Inverse and Final Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)` and then performs the final calculation `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M`.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic appears to be sound. The program correctly implements the steps required to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
