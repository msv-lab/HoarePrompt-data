### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic of the provided program. Let's break down the program and verify each part against the problem statement and the given function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Calculating the Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates the sum of all friendship values (`sum_f`).
   - It computes the total number of unique pairs (`cn2`), which is \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \).

3. **Expected Friendship Value Calculation:**
   - The formula used in the program is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{2 \times \text{cn2}^2}
     \]
   - Simplifying the numerator:
     \[
     2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)
     \]
   - Simplifying the denominator:
     \[
     2 \times \text{cn2}^2
     \]

4. **Simplifying the Formula:**
   - The formula simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{k \times \text{sum\_f}}{\text{cn2}}
     \]
   - This is because:
     \[
     \frac{2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{2 \times \text{cn2}^2} = \frac{k \times \text{sum\_f} + \frac{m \times k \times (k - 1)}{2 \times \text{cn2}}}{\text{cn2}}
     \]
   - Since \( m \times k \times (k - 1) \) is much smaller compared to \( k \times \text{sum\_f} \) for large `k`, the term \( \frac{m \times k \times (k - 1)}{2 \times \text{cn2}^2} \) is negligible.

5. **GCD and Modulo Operation:**
   - The program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the fraction.
   - It then calculates the modular inverse of the denominator using `pow(q, -1, M)` and applies the modulo operation.

### Verification:

- The simplified formula \( \text{Expected Value} = \frac{k \times \text{sum\_f}}{\text{cn2}} \) is correct.
- The GCD and modular inverse calculations ensure the result is in the form \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime.
- The final result is computed correctly using modular arithmetic.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the expected value and handles the required mathematical operations accurately.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
