Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
   - `balance` is 0.
   - `details` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains the current value of `balance`, the negative index of the character in `s`, and the character itself.
   - `result` is a string that concatenates all characters from `details` in the order of their appearance in `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, it means every opening parenthesis "(" has a corresponding closing parenthesis ")".
   - `balance` starts at 0 and changes based on the characters in `s`. It increases by 1 for every opening parenthesis "(" and decreases by 1 for every closing parenthesis ")".
   - `details` is a sorted list of tuples. Each tuple contains the current value of `balance`, the negative index of the character in `s`, and the character itself. Because `s` is a balanced sequence, the balance will go up and down but will always end up back at 0.
   - `result` is constructed by concatenating all characters from `details` in the order they appear in `s`.

Given these points, let's consider a simple example to illustrate:

- Suppose `s = "(()())"`.
  - `balance` starts at 0.
  - When the first character is "(", `balance` becomes 1.
  - When the second character is "(", `balance` becomes 2.
  - When the third character is ")", `balance` becomes 1.
  - When the fourth character is ")", `balance` becomes 0.
  - When the fifth character is "(", `balance` becomes 1.
  - When the sixth character is ")", `balance` becomes 0.

The `details` list would be sorted based on the negative index of each character in `s`:
- For "(", the negative index is -1, -3, -5.
- For ")", the negative index is -2, -4.

So, `details` might look like this:
\[ (1, -1, '('), (2, -3, '('), (1, -5, '('), (0, -2, ')'), (0, -4, ')') \]

Concatenating these characters in the order of their appearance in `s` gives us the `result`:
\[ result = "(()())" \]

Therefore, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be the original string `s`.

Output: **s (where s is the original balanced parentheses sequence)**
