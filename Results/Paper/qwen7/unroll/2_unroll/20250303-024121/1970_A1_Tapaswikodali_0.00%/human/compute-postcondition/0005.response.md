Output State: `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `balance` is 0; `details` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: the current value of `balance`, the negative index of the character in `s`, and the character itself. The list is constructed such that for every opening parenthesis "(", `balance` increases by 1, and for every closing parenthesis ")", `balance` decreases by 1.
