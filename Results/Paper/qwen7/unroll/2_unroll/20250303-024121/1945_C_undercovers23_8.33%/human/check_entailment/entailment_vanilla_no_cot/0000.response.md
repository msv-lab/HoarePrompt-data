Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Percentages**: The code calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using percentages (`100`), which is unnecessary and incorrect. It should directly check if the conditions for satisfaction are met without converting to percentages.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not correctly handle edge cases, such as when the entire village prefers one side or when the number of residents on each side is very small.

3. **Sorting Final List**: The final list is sorted, but the requirement is to find the smallest index `i` that satisfies the condition, not necessarily the smallest index from the sorted list.

4. **Logic for Minimum Distance**: The logic to find the minimum distance from `n//2` is flawed. The current implementation might not correctly identify the optimal position when there are multiple candidates.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        sl = list(s)
        zero = sl.count('0')
        one = sl.count('1')
        
        # Initialize variables to track the best position
        best_position = -1
        min_distance = float('inf')
        
        zero_left = 0
        one_right = one
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero_left += 1
            else:
                one_right -= 1
            
            if zero_left >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and one_right >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                current_distance = abs((n // 2) - (i + 1))
                if current_distance < min_distance:
                    min_distance = current_distance
                    best_position = i + 1
                elif current_distance == min_distance:
                    best_position = min(best_position, i + 1)
        
        if best_position == -1:
            # If no valid position is found, check the entire village
            if zero >= math.ceil(n / 2):
                best_position = 0
            else:
                best_position = n
        
        print(best_position)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected solution:
- Directly checks if the conditions for satisfaction are met.
- Handles edge cases more robustly.
- Finds the optimal position correctly by minimizing the distance from `n//2`.
