Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. It returns a result based on the sum of n across all test cases.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a test count `t`, a number `n`, and a binary string `a`. The function does not return anything specific within the function itself but processes the data according to the constraints given. The primary output is implied through the sum of `n` across all test cases.
