Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state is given as `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input from the user, and the constraint is \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), we know that `t` will always be a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Given the constraints, we can directly state that `t` must be greater than 0.

5. **Consider Other Variables**: The variables `n` and `a` are mentioned but they are not part of the loop head, so their values do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0**
