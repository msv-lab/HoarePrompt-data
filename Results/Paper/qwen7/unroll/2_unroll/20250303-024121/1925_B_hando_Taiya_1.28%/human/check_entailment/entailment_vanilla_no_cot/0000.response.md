Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the logic used to calculate the maximum balance. The program attempts to find the maximum GCD by iterating through potential divisors, but it does not correctly handle the constraints and conditions specified in the problem statement.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Constraints**: The program should ensure that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals `x` and that there are exactly `n` sub-problems. However, the current implementation does not properly check these conditions.

2. **Logic for Finding Maximum GCD**: The program tries to maximize the GCD by checking all divisors of `x`, but it does not correctly account for the number of sub-problems `n`. Specifically, it should consider the possibility of breaking `x` into exactly `n` parts where each part is a divisor of `x`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `n` is greater than `x` or when `x` is prime and `n` is less than `x`.

To fix the program, you need to ensure that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals `x` and that there are exactly `n` sub-problems. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if x % i == 0 and x // i >= n:
            ans = max(ans, gcd(i, x // i))
    print(ans)
```

This corrected program ensures that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals `x` and that there are exactly `n` sub-problems, thus correctly finding the maximum balance.
