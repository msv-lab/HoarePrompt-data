The function processes a series of test cases, each containing three values: `t`, `x`, and `n`. It calculates the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` for which either `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `n` is less than or equal to `i`, where the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x`. The function then prints this maximum value for each test case.
