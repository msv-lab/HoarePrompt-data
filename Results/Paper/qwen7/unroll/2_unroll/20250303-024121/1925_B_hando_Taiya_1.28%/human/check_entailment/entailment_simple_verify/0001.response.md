### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties is `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If we can find a divisor `d` of `x` such that `x / d >= n`, then we can have `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `d`. This ensures the sum of difficulties is `x` and the GCD is `d`.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
   - It then iterates over possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` (`isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` is a valid divisor of `x` and if either `x // i >= n` or `i >= n`.
   - It updates the answer `ans` with the maximum value found.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum balance `ans`.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies potential divisors of `x` and checks if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - The program ensures that the GCD is maximized by considering both `i` and `x // i` as potential candidates.
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, and the solution works within the given limits.

5. **Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:**
   - **Before Function Call:**
     - `tc` is read and stored as the number of test cases.
   - **Inside `func_1`:**
     - `x` and `n` are read for the current test case.
     - A variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
     - The loop iterates over possible divisors `i` of `x` from 1 to `isqrt(x)`.
       - If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `x`.
       - If `n <= x // i`, then `i` can be a valid sub-problem difficulty.
       - If `n <= i`, then `x // i` can be a valid sub-problem difficulty.
       - The maximum of `i` and `x // i` is updated to `ans`.
   - **After Loop:**
     - The maximum balance `ans` is printed.

6. **Validation Against Example:**
   - For the example input:
     - Test Case 1: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
       - Possible divisors: 1, 2, 5, 10
       - Valid sub-problems: (4, 2, 4) with GCD 2.
     - Test Case 2: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
       - Possible divisors: 1, 5
       - Valid sub-problems: (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) with GCD 1.
     - Test Case 3: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
       - Possible divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 69, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420
       - Valid sub-problems: (6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6,
