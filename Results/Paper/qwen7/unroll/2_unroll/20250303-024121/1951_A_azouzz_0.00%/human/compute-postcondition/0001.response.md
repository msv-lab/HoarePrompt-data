Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder for an index) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop condition (`t > 0`) is met. Since `t` is the only variable that directly affects the loop's ability to execute, we need to adjust its value to be greater than 0.

4. **Consider the Initial State**: The initial state given is that `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, and `t` is an input integer. We need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0**
