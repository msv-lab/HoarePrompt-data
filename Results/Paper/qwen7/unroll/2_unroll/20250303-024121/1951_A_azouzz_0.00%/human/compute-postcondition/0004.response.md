Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a range of folder names specified by `start` and `end`, where `start` and `end` are integers and `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The function returns based on whether the range is valid (i.e., `start` is less than or equal to `end`), returning an error message if not. If the range is valid, it proceeds to process the folder names within the specified range.**
