Output State: The output state will consist of the length of the list `nums` and the elements of `nums` after processing each test case. For each test case, the list `nums` will contain the values `[k - (1 << idx), k + 1, k + (1 << idx) + 1]` where `idx` is the index just less than the first element in `nums` greater than `k`, and `nums` initially contains the first 21 powers of 2. After removing one of these powers of 2, the list will have 21 elements. The output will repeat this process for each test case, with the length of `nums` printed first, followed by the elements of `nums`.
