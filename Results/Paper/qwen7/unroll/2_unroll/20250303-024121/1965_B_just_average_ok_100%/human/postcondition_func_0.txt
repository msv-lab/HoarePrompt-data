The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, two integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, it generates a list `nums` containing up to 23 unique integers derived from \(k\) and some powers of 2. Specifically, the list includes the values \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), the value of \(k\), \(k - 2^{idx}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{idx} + 1\), where \(idx\) is the index just before the first power of 2 greater than \(k\). The function then prints the number of elements in `nums` followed by the elements themselves.
