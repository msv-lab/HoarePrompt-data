### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Input Handling:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
- It then reads `n` and `k` for each test case.

#### Initialization:
- The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This is done using the list comprehension `[1 << i for i in range(21)]`.
- This list will have values like `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^20]`.

#### Finding the Index:
- The program iterates through the list `nums` to find the index `idx` where `nums[i]` is the largest value less than or equal to `k`.
- If `nums[i]` exceeds `k`, it breaks the loop and sets `idx` to `i - 1`.

#### Appending Values:
- The program appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`.
- It also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
- Finally, it removes the element `1 << idx` from `nums`.

#### Output:
- The length of `nums` is printed.
- The elements of `nums` are printed.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
   - The values in `nums` are powers of 2 and some additional values derived from these powers.
   - Since no combination of these values can sum exactly to `k` (as they are powers of 2 and derived values), this condition is satisfied.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
   - The values in `nums` include all powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
   - By appending `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by subsequences.
   - Removing `1 << idx` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The program assumes that the values in `nums` can form all required subsequences, but it does not guarantee that all values from 1 to `n` can be formed as required. Specifically, the values `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` might not cover all necessary subsequences, especially when `n` is large.

For example, consider the test case:
```
9 3
```
- The program generates the list `nums` as `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]`.
- For `k = 3`, the program finds `idx = 1` (since `2 < 3` and `4 > 3`).
- The list `nums` becomes `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216, 3, 4, 5]`.
- The program prints `len(nums) = 25` and the elements.

This list does not ensure that all values from 1 to 9 (except 3) can be formed by subsequences. For instance, the value 7 cannot be formed by any subsequence of the generated list.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to generate a sequence `a` that meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
