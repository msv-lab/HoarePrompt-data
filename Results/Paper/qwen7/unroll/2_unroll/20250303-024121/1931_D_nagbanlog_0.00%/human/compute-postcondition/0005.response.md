Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `test_cases`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, the function calculates the count of beautiful pairs and returns a list of these counts.**

This means the function processes each test case to determine the count of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions and returns a list of these counts for all test cases.
