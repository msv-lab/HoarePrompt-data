Reasoning:
1. The provided function `func_1` correctly processes each test case according to the problem statement.
2. It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of numbers based on their modular values relative to `x` and `y`.
3. For each number in the array, it calculates the required modular values and checks if these values exist in the frequency dictionary. If they do, it increments the `beautiful_count` by the frequency of those values.
4. The function correctly handles the conditions for a pair to be considered "beautiful" based on the problem statement.
5. The function iterates through each test case and returns a list of counts corresponding to the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
