Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and counting the number of beautiful pairs. However, there are several issues with the logic used to determine the beautiful pairs:

1. **Modular Arithmetic Calculation**: The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`, which is not correct for determining if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. Instead, we should check if the sum of the remainders when divided by `x` is zero, i.e., `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0`.

2. **Modular Difference Check**: Similarly, the check for `a_i - a_j` being divisible by `y` should be based on the difference of the remainders, i.e., `(a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0`.

3. **Frequency Counting**: The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to count occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs, but the logic to increment `beautiful_count` is flawed. It should count pairs where the required modular conditions are met.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            
            # Check for beautiful pairs
            for (req_mod_x, req_mod_y) in freq:
                if (mod_x + req_mod_x) % x == 0 and (mod_y - req_mod_y) % y == 0:
                    beautiful_count += freq[(req_mod_x, req_mod_y)]
            
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] = 0
            freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] += 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    
    return results
```

Given this analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for checking the conditions for beautiful pairs. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
