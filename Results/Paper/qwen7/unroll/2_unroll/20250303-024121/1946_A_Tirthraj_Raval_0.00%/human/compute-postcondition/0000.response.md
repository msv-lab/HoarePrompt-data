Output State: **t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and the array a contains n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet is just a comment block stating the problem description for finding the median of an array. No variables are defined or modified within this snippet. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
