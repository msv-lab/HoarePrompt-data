Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. An operation involves incrementing any element by 1.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It calculates the index `p` of the median using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
   - It counts the occurrences of the element at index `p` in the sorted array `a` and prints this count.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The median is correctly identified based on the sorted array.
   - The logic for finding the median index `p` is correct.
   - However, the program does not actually perform any operations to increase the median. Instead, it simply counts how many times the current median appears in the array.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not attempt to modify the array to increase the median.
   - The output is the count of the current median in the array, which does not represent the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

Conclusion:
The given program does not solve the problem as stated. It fails to perform the necessary operations to increase the median and instead outputs a count of the median in the array.

Correctness: **False**
