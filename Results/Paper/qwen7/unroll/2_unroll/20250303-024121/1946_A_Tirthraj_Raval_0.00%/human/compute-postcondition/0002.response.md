Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
   - The only variable mentioned here is `_`, but since it's a dummy variable (often used as a placeholder), we don't need to adjust its value.
   - The key variable to consider is `t`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute `t` times.
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `t` is the only variable that affects the loop execution, we need to ensure `t` is a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a positive integer.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be a positive integer**
