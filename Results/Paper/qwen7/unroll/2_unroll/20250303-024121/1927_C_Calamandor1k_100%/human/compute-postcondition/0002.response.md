Output State: `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. If the conditions for any test case are not met (i.e., `len(only_a) > k // 2`, `len(only_b) > k // 2`, or `total_distinct < k`), then 'NO' is appended to the list; otherwise, 'YES' is appended.
