The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths. For each test case, it counts the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times and prints this count. The function ultimately outputs the total count of such unique stick lengths across all test cases.
