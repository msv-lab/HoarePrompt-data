Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including an integer `t` (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by `t` sets of inputs, each containing an integer `n` (such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). For each set, it returns whether it's possible to form a non-degenerate triangle from the given stick lengths.**

This means the function is designed to process multiple test cases where each test case includes a number of sticks with specific lengths. It then determines for each test case if it's possible to form at least one non-degenerate triangle using the given stick lengths.
