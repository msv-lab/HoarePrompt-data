Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `v` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n/2`.
   - `n` is the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `k` is the return value of `func_3()`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n // k + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` starts at 1, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `n` and `k` are both the return values of `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` returns a value, we need to ensure that `n` and `k` are valid and non-zero (since division by zero would cause an error).
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n // k + 1` must be at least 1, meaning `n // k` must be at least 0. This implies that `n` should be at least `k`.

Given the above points, we need to ensure that `n` and `k` are valid and that `n` is at least `k`.

**Final State**:
- `v` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n/2` (no need to adjust this as it's derived from `n`).
- `n` is the return value of `func_3()` and must be at least `k`.
- `k` is the return value of `func_3()` and must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

State: **`v` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n/2`, `n` is the return value of `func_3()` and must be at least `k`, `k` is the return value of `func_3()` and must be a positive integer**
