Output State: **v is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n/2, n is the return value of func_3(), k is the return value of func_3().**

Explanation: The loop runs from `n` down to 1. If `v` equals `n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. Since `v` starts at 1 and is updated only when it equals `n`, `v` will be set to the first `i` that is less than or equal to `n`. This `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n/2` because the loop decrements `i` from `n` downwards, and the first time `v` (which starts at 1) equals `n` would be around the middle of the range for large `n`. Variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
