To determine if the given Python program is correct based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Querying for Maximum Value `v`:**
   - The function `func_5` starts by reading `n` and `k`.
   - It then queries the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n` for decreasing values of `i` starting from `n`. This is done to find the maximum possible value `v` that could be the product of the length and the maximum value of any subarray.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - After finding `v`, the function attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray has the product of its length and its maximum value equal to `v`.
   - It does this by iterating through potential starting points `l` and querying the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v`.

3. **Checking Validity of Split:**
   - If for a given `i * v`, it successfully finds `k` subarrays without exceeding `n`, it prints the result and returns.
   - If it fails to find such a split, it prints `-1`.

### Analysis:
- **Finding `v`:**
  - The approach of querying `f(1, r) = i * n` for decreasing values of `i` is correct to find the maximum possible value `v`. This ensures that `v` is the highest value that can be achieved by any subarray.

- **Splitting the Array:**
  - The logic to split the array into `k` subarrays by checking `f(l, r) = i * v` is sound. However, there are a few issues:
    - The loop to check for `k` subarrays might not be optimal. It assumes that the first `k` subarrays found will always be valid, which is not necessarily true.
    - The condition `if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1:` is used to check if the split is successful. This condition is correct but might not handle edge cases well.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle cases where the array cannot be split into `k` subarrays with the required properties.
  - There might be scenarios where the array can be split in more than one way, and the current logic might not capture all valid splits.

### Conclusion:
While the basic logic is correct, the implementation might not cover all edge cases and could benefit from additional checks and optimizations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False** due to potential edge cases and lack of comprehensive validation.

**Correctness: False**
