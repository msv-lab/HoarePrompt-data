### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled correctly by the outer loop that iterates `t` times.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes `n` and `m` correctly from the input for each test case. This is done using `map(int, input().split())`, which splits the input into two integers.
3. **Problem Counting**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using an array `count`. This is achieved by iterating over the string `a` and incrementing the corresponding index in the `count` array.
4. **Calculation of Needed Problems**: For each difficulty level, it calculates how many additional problems are needed to meet the requirement of `m` rounds. This is done by checking if the current count of problems for that difficulty level is less than `m`, and if so, adding the difference to `needed_problems`. This logic is correct and follows the problem statement.
5. **Output**: The function returns the total number of problems needed, which is printed for each test case. This is done correctly by calling `print(func_1(n, m, a))`.

Given the provided code, all steps align with the problem statement and the example provided. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed. The overall structure and logic of the program are sound and match the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the input, counts the occurrences of each difficulty level, and calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.

### Final:
**True**
