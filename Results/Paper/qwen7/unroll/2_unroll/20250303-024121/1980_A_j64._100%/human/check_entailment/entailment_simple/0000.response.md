Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and calls the `func_1` function with the appropriate parameters.
2. The `func_1` function initializes a list `count` of size 7 to keep track of the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the input string `a`.
3. It iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the character's position in the alphabet.
4. After counting the frequencies, it calculates how many more problems are needed for each difficulty level to reach at least `m` problems per level.
5. The sum of these additional problems is returned as the result.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic implemented in the `func_1` function is correct. It accurately calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each difficulty level has at least `m` problems.

Correctness: **True**
