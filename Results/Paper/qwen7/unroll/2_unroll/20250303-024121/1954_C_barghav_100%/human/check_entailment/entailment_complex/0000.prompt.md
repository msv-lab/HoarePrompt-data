Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `f` is 1, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters where each character has been swapped with another character based on the conditions in the loop, `b` is a list of characters from the input() function.
    #
    #To explain further, the loop compares each character in list `a` with the corresponding character in list `b`. If the character in `a` is less than the character in `b`, they swap places and `f` is set to 1. If the character in `a` is greater than the character in `b`, `f` is set to 1. The loop continues until all characters in `a` have been compared with those in `b`. Since `f` is initially 0 and is only set to 1 under certain conditions, it will be 1 after the loop completes unless no swaps occurred. The lists `a` and `b` will contain characters that may have swapped positions according to the loop's conditions.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: f is 1, x is a string representing an integer, y is a string representing an integer, a is a list of characters that may have swapped positions based on the comparison with list b, b is a list of characters from the input() function.
    print()
    #This is printed: an empty line
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: b is printed as a string with each character separated by a space.
    print()
    #This is printed: a string representation of `b` where each character is separated by a space
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as inputs, each representing an integer of the same length. It then compares each corresponding pair of characters from these strings. If a character in `x` is less than the corresponding character in `y`, they are swapped. This process continues for all pairs of characters. After processing, the function prints the modified string `x` followed by an empty line and then the original string `y` with each character separated by a space. The function does not return any value.
