#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `f` is 1, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters where each character has been swapped with another character based on the conditions in the loop, `b` is a list of characters from the input() function.
    #
    #To explain further, the loop compares each character in list `a` with the corresponding character in list `b`. If the character in `a` is less than the character in `b`, they swap places and `f` is set to 1. If the character in `a` is greater than the character in `b`, `f` is set to 1. The loop continues until all characters in `a` have been compared with those in `b`. Since `f` is initially 0 and is only set to 1 under certain conditions, it will be 1 after the loop completes unless no swaps occurred. The lists `a` and `b` will contain characters that may have swapped positions according to the loop's conditions.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: f is 1, x is a string representing an integer, y is a string representing an integer, a is a list of characters that may have swapped positions based on the comparison with list b, b is a list of characters from the input() function.
    print()
    #This is printed: an empty line
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: b is printed as a string with each character separated by a space.
    print()
    #This is printed: a string representation of `b` where each character is separated by a space
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as inputs, each representing an integer of the same length. It then compares each corresponding pair of characters from these strings. If a character in `x` is less than the corresponding character in `y`, they are swapped. This process continues for all pairs of characters. After processing, the function prints the modified string `x` followed by an empty line and then the original string `y` with each character separated by a space. The function does not return any value.
