Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y`. Specifically, the swapping logic in `func_1()` is flawed. It does not always ensure that the highest possible digits are swapped to maximize the product. For instance, it only swaps when the current digit of `a` is less than the corresponding digit of `b` and does not consider the overall impact on the product.

To fix this, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as sorting the digits of both numbers in descending order and then pairing the largest available digits from each number to maximize their product.
