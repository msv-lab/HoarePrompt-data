You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: For each test case, the output will either print 'Yes' followed by a randomly permuted version of the input string, or 'No' if the string does not change after permutation. The number of test cases and their respective outputs depend on the input provided during the loop's execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Shuffling the String**:
   - The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to shuffle the characters of the string `s`.
   - This function returns a list of characters from `s` in a random order.
   - `''.join(...)` converts this list back into a string.

3. **Checking for Distinctness**:
   - The program checks if the shuffled string `s2` is different from the original string `s` using `if s != s2:`.
   - If they are different, it prints "Yes" followed by the shuffled string `s2`.
   - If they are the same, it prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the string consists of repeated characters (like "aaaaa") correctly by checking if the shuffled string is different.
   - For strings with unique characters (like "co"), the program also works correctly.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" in the required format.
   - It outputs the shuffled string `s2` if `s` and `s2` are different.

### Testing Specific Examples:

- **Example 1**: `codeforces`
  - Shuffled: `forcodesec` (different, so "Yes")
- **Example 2**: `aaaaa`
  - Shuffled: `aaaaa` (same, so "No")
- **Example 3**: `xxxxy`
  - Shuffled: `xxyxx` (different, so "Yes")
- **Example 4**: `co`
  - Shuffled: `oc` (different, so "Yes")

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to check if a string can be rearranged to form a different string. It handles all edge cases and outputs the results in the correct format.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
