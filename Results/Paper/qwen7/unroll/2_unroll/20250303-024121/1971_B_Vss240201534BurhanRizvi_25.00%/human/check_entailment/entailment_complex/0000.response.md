Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Permutation**: It generates a random permutation of the input string `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`.
3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - If the original string `s` is different from its random permutation `s2`, it prints "Yes" followed by the permuted string `s2`.
   - If the original string `s` is the same as its random permutation `s2`, it prints "No".

Given these points, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement. It handles all cases correctly, including when no valid permutation exists (e.g., for strings like "aaaaa" where all permutations are identical).

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
