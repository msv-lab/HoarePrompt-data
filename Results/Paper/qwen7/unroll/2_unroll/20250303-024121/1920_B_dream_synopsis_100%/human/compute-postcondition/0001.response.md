Output State: t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); for each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \leq x, k \leq n\); and a list of n integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\). The output for each test case is the maximum value among the sums calculated in the loop, where the sums are derived from the sorted and reversed list \(a\).
