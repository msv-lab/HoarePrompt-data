### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Sorting**: The array `a` is sorted in descending order, which helps in considering the largest elements first.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The initial sum of the array (`sum1`) is calculated.
4. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - Alice can remove up to `k` elements.
   - Bob can negate up to `x` elements.
   - For each possible combination of elements Alice removes and Bob negates, the program calculates the new sum and stores it in the list `ans`.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If Alice removes no elements (`i == 0`), the sum is adjusted by subtracting twice the sum of the smallest `x` elements.
   - For other cases, the sum is adjusted by adding the removed element and subtracting twice the negated element.
   - If the indices go out of bounds, the sum is adjusted by just adding the removed element.
6. **Result Output**: The maximum sum from the list `ans` is printed, which represents the best possible outcome for Alice after Bob's optimal move.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program appears to handle the problem correctly. It considers all possible combinations of removals and negations within the given limits and computes the optimal sum accordingly.
