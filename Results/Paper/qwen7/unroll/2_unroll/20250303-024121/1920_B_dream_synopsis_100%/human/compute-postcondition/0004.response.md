Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, k, x, and a list of n integers a. It sorts the list a in descending order and calculates a series of sums based on specific conditions involving x and k. For each test case, it computes these sums and appends them to a list. Finally, it prints the maximum value among these sums for each test case.**
