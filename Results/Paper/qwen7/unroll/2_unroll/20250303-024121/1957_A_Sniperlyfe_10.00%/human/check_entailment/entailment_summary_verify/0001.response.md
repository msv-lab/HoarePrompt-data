### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons (with equal-sided) that can be constructed using the given sticks, where no stick is used in more than one polygon.
2. **Function Summary Analysis**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary. It then calculates the total number of regular polygons by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 and summing these values. This approach is correct because a regular polygon with \( k \) sides requires \( k \) sticks of the same length, and the minimum \( k \) is 4 for a quadrilateral.
3. **Main Loop Analysis**: The main loop reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` with the list of stick lengths. This part of the code is also correct as it handles multiple test cases appropriately.
4. **Edge Cases**: The provided code handles edge cases such as when there are fewer than 4 sticks (which results in 0 polygons) and when the stick lengths are sufficient to form polygons.

Based on the function summary and the main logic of the program, the provided code accurately solves the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct according to the problem description and the given function summary.
