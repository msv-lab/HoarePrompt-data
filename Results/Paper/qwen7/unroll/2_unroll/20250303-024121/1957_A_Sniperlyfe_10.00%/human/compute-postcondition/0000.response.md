Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100; `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. The initial state of the list `arr` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated information about the `freq` dictionary being empty while retaining the original state of `arr`.
