Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the square root of n is less than or equal to the maximum possible value derived from the conditions (x + y) * x ≤ n and (x + y) * y ≤ m for all valid pairs (x, y); `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6; `x` is 1; `cnt` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `x`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while adding the new condition for `cnt`.
