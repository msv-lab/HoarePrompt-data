Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x * x <= n`.
2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `x` and `n`.
3. **Check the current state of these variables**:
   - `x` is currently set to 1.
   - `n` is updated to the first integer input.
4. **Evaluate the loop condition with the current values**:
   - Since `x` is 1, `x * x` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `1 * 1` (which is 1) must be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `n` is updated to the first integer input, let's denote this first integer input as `first_input`. Therefore, the condition `1 * 1 <= first_input` must hold true for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` (which is `first_input`) is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `first_input` is less than 1, the loop will not execute at all.

So, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is updated to the first integer input and must be at least 1, `m` is updated to the second integer input, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0**
