Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, both `q` and `x` satisfy 1 ≤ `x` < `q` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a list containing one element which is `w`; `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer, and it was previously stated that `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, the updated state includes `M` now containing the value of `w`. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged.
