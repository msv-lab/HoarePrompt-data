You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

    #State: Output State: The value of `t` after all iterations of the loop have completed, which depends on the values of `a` and `b` for each iteration. Specifically, `t` is updated based on the conditions provided in the loop body. If `t1` (calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is increased by the result of the calculation involving `a - t1`. The final value of `t` will be the sum of its original value and any increments calculated during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates a value \(t\) based on certain conditions and prints the final value of \(t\). Initially, \(t\) is set to \(b\), and it is adjusted based on whether \(t \times 15 - b \times 4\) is greater than or equal to \(a\). If not, \(t\) is incremented further depending on the remainder when \(a - t \times 15 + b \times 4\) is divided by 15. The function ultimately outputs the final value of \(t\) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells, which means they can be placed in the remaining space of a screen after placing 1x1 icons. Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input `x = 4` and `y = 2`. According to the problem description, we need to fit 4 one-by-one icons and 2 two-by-two icons. 

- Two 2x2 icons will occupy 8 cells, which can fit into 2 screens since each screen has 15 cells.
- The remaining 4 cells can fit 4 one-by-one icons.

However, the program calculates the number of screens as follows:
1. It calculates `t = b` (where `b` is the number of 2x2 icons), which is 2.
2. It then checks if `t1 >= a` (where `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`), but this calculation is incorrect because it does not properly account for the placement of 1x1 icons in the remaining space.

In this specific case, the program incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `2`, because it does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons in the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
