Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each corresponding to the result of one test case. For each test case, if \( b \leq a \), the output will be \( a \times n \). Otherwise, the output will be \( b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \), where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \).

This means for each test case, the output will either be a simple multiplication of \( a \) and \( n \) or a more complex calculation involving \( b \), \( k \), and \( n \), depending on the conditions specified in the loop.
