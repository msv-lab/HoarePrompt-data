Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints either `a * n` or `b * k - k * (k - 1) / 2 + (n - k) * a`, depending on whether `b` is less than or equal to `a`. Here, `k` is defined as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
