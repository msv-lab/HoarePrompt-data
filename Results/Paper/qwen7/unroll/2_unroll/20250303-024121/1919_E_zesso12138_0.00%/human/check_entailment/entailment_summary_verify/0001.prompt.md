You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        dp = new_dp
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]

#Function 2:

    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(n, p)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the hidden array `n` and a sorted list of integers `p`. It then calls another function `func_1(n, p)` to compute some result based on `n` and `p`. Finally, it prints the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function aims to compute the number of ways to form a sequence \(a\) such that the sorted prefix sums match the given array \(p\).

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized to zero with a length of \(2n + 1\).
   - `offset` is set to \(n\), representing the midpoint where the prefix sums start from.
   - `dp[offset]` is set to 1, indicating one way to start with an empty prefix sum at the midpoint.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - A new DP array `new_dp` is created to store intermediate results.
   - For each position `j` in the DP array, if `dp[j]` is greater than 0, it means there is a way to reach that position.
   - Two transitions are made:
     - `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j]`.
     - `new_dp[j - 1]` is also updated similarly.
   - This effectively simulates adding either a `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - The final sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, which corresponds to the last element in the sorted prefix sum array plus the midpoint.

#### Function `func_2`
This function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - Reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Splits the input into tokens.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Iterates over each test case.
   - Extracts `n` and the prefix sum array `p`.
   - Calls `func_1` to get the result for each test case.
   - Appends the result to the `results` list.

3. **Output**:
   - Prints the results for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Problem Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled correctly, including the modulo operation (`998244353`).

2. **Correctness of DP Transition**:
   - The DP transition logic in `func_1` is designed to count the number of valid sequences that can produce the given sorted prefix sums.
   - The transitions correctly account for adding `1` or `-1` to the prefix sums.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic implemented in both functions is consistent with the problem requirements. The dynamic programming approach correctly counts the number of valid sequences for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
