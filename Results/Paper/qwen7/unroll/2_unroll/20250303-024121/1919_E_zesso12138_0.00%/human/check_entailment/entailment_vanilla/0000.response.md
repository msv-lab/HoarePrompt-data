Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
This function aims to compute the number of ways to form the array `a` from the sorted prefix sum array `p`. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `dp` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `2 * n + 1`.
   - `offset` is set to `n`, representing the midpoint of the range.
   - `dp[offset]` is set to 1, indicating that there is one way to have a prefix sum of zero at the midpoint.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - A new DP array `new_dp` is created for each iteration.
   - For each position `j` in the current DP array, if `dp[j]` is greater than 0, it means there is a way to achieve the prefix sum `j`.
   - Two possible moves are considered:
     - Adding 1 to the current prefix sum (`j + 1`).
     - Subtracting 1 from the current prefix sum (`j - 1`).
   - These transitions are performed modulo `MOD` to handle large numbers.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the final prefix sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
   - The value at `dp[final_sum]` is returned, which represents the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sum.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - Reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Splits the input into tokens.
   - Extracts the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, extracts `n` and the sorted prefix sum array `p`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - Calls `func_1` with `n` and `p` to get the result.
   - Appends the result to the `results` list.

3. **Output**:
   - Prints the results for each test case.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The dynamic programming approach correctly models the transitions between prefix sums.
   - The use of modulo ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is efficient and correctly processes multiple test cases.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as single-element arrays and arrays with specific values like `-1` and `1`.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is applied correctly throughout the computation to ensure the result is within the required bounds.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. There are no apparent errors in the implementation.

**Correctness: True**
