    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns dp[final_sum], which is 0 since final_sum is p[-1] + n and all elements in dp are initialized to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer within the range of 1 to 5000, and `p`, a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of length `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to 0. The function then iterates over the range of `n` and updates the `dp` array based on certain conditions. Finally, it calculates `final_sum` as `p[-1] + n` and returns the value at index `final_sum` in the `dp` array, which is guaranteed to be 0 due to the initialization and update process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers where |pi| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.

    #State: `index` is 2 + 2t, `t` is t, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[0]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]` for each iteration, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using the split() method, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, no changes in the loop, `res` is each element in `results` printed during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the hidden array `n` and a sorted list of integers `p`. It then calls another function `func_1(n, p)` to compute some result based on `n` and `p`. Finally, it prints the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all test cases.
