Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`; and `p`, which is a list of `n` integers where |pi| ≤ n and is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information.**
