Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |pi| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using the split() method.**

The code reads all input at once using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings. The original values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. The new variable `data` is created and assigned the result of the split operation.
