Output State: `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `check` is 2147483647.

Explanation: The loop processes a series of inputs but does not modify the values of `t` or `check`. The variable `t` is only defined in the initial state and is not altered within the loop. The variable `check` is set to `2147483647` at the start and remains unchanged throughout the loop executions. Therefore, both `t` and `check` retain their initial values after the loop completes all its iterations.
