You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
def func():
    times = int(input())
    check = 2 ** 31 - 1
    for _ in range(times):
        n = int(input())
        data = list(map(int, input().split()))
        dic = dict()
        ans = n
        check = 2 ** 31 - 1
        for i in data:
            s = i ^ check
            if s in dic:
                dic[s] -= 1
                ans -= 1
                if dic[s] == 0:
                    del dic[s]
            elif i in dic:
                dic[i] += 1
            else:
                dic[i] = 1
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, ..., a_n` (where \(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31}\)). For each test case, it calculates and prints the count of unique elements in the list after performing bitwise XOR operations. The function does not return any value but prints the count for each sub-case. The variables `t` and `check` remain unchanged after processing all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `times`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `data`.

2. **Bitwise Operation:**
   - A variable `check` is initialized to \(2^{31} - 1\), which is a bitmask with all 31 bits set to 1.
   - For each integer `i` in the list `data`, the program computes `s = i ^ check`. This operation flips all 31 bits of `i`.

3. **Dictionary Usage:**
   - A dictionary `dic` is used to keep track of the count of integers that match after the bitwise operation.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, representing the initial number of groups needed.
   - For each integer `i` in `data`:
     - If `s` (after flipping all 31 bits) is already in the dictionary, it means there is another integer in the same group. The count for `s` is decremented, and the count for `i` is also decremented, reducing the number of groups needed.
     - If `i` itself is already in the dictionary, it means this integer is being reused, and the count is incremented.
     - Otherwise, a new entry is added to the dictionary with the count set to 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the current value of `ans` for each test case, which should represent the minimum number of groups required.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Flipping Bits:** The operation `i ^ check` effectively flips all 31 bits of `i`, which is equivalent to checking if `i` and another integer have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st position.
- **Dictionary Usage:** The dictionary helps in efficiently tracking how many integers share the same flipped bit pattern, ensuring that only unique patterns are counted as separate groups.
- **Output:** The final value of `ans` represents the minimum number of groups required, as it decreases whenever two integers with the same flipped bit pattern are found.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify with the provided examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `4 1 4 3 4`
  - After flipping bits: `1 -> 2147483647`, `4 -> 2147483644`, `3 -> 2147483646`
  - All integers have different flipped bit patterns, so `ans` remains `4`.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `2 0 2147483647`
  - After flipping bits: `0 -> 2147483647`, `2147483647 -> 0`
  - Both integers have the same flipped bit pattern, so `ans` becomes `1`.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `5 476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767`
  - After flipping bits: Various patterns, but some might match, leading to fewer groups.

### Conclusion:

The program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem requirements accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
