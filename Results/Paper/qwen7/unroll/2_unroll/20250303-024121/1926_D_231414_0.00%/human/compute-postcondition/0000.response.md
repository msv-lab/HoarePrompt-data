Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and the initial state of `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `times = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `times`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The other variables and their initial states remain unaffected.
