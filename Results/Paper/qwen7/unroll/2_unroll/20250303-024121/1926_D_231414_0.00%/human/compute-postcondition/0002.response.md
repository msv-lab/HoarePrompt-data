Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `times`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `times` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the value of `times`, we need to ensure that `times` is greater than 0. The other variables (`t` and `check`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `times` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`times` must be greater than 0**
