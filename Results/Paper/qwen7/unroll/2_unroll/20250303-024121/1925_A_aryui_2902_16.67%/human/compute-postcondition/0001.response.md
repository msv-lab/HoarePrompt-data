Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'**.

The code initializes a string `s` with the value `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
