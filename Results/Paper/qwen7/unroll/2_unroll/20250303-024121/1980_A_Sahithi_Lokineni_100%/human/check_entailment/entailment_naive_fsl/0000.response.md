Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed. Specifically, the program initializes `d` using `defaultdict(default_value)` but `default_value` is not defined. This will result in a `NameError`. Additionally, the logic for calculating the minimum number of additional problems is flawed. The program assumes that the number of rounds `m` is the limiting factor for each difficulty level, which is not always true. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
The correct output should be `2` because there are only 2 'A' and 2 'F' problems, and Vlad needs at least one of each to hold the round. However, the program will incorrectly output `0` because it does not properly account for the requirement of having at least one problem of each difficulty level for the specified number of rounds.

To fix this, the program should ensure that for each difficulty level, the number of problems required is at least `m`, and then calculate the total number of additional problems needed.
