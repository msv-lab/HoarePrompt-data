Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most \( k \) bridges.
2. The provided function iterates over the number of test cases, reads \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case, and then prints a value based on the condition \( n - k \leq 1 \).
3. If \( n - k \leq 1 \), the function prints \( n \). Otherwise, it prints 1.
4. This logic aligns with the problem statement:
   - If \( n - k \leq 1 \), it means that even after destroying \( k \) bridges, Everule can still reach all islands (or at least island 1 and one more island).
   - If \( n - k > 1 \), it means that destroying \( k \) bridges will isolate Everule from all other islands except possibly island 1.
5. The function correctly handles all given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
