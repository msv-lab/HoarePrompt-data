Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range()` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop will run based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the valid range specified.
   - The valid range for the input value is \(1 \leq \text{input value} \leq 10^3\).

3. **Formulate the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, ensuring it is within the valid range.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
