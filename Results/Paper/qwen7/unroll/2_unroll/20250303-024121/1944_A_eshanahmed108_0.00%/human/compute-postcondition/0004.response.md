Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). Based on the condition \( n - k \leq 1 \), it prints either \( n \) or 1. The final state of the program is a series of outputs, each corresponding to the result of the condition check for each test case.**
