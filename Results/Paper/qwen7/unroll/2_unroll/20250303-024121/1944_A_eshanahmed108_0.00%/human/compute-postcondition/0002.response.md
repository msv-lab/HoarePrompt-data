Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed based on the condition `n if n - k <= 1 else 1` for each test case. For each test case, if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, the output will be `n`, otherwise, it will be `1`. The number of outputs will be equal to the number of test cases provided by the input.
