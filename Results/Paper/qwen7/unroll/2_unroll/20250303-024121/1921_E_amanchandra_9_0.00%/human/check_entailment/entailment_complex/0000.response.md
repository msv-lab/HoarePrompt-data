Reasoning:
The annotated program seems to follow the rules of the game and the logic for determining the winner or if the game is a draw. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Check**: The program correctly checks if `xa > xb` and prints 'Draw' if true. This handles the case where Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, which means Alice cannot capture Bob's chip since she can only move down, down-right, or down-left.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates `x` as half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`. This is used to determine the range `[l, r]` for the vertical positions.

3. **Odd Distance Case**: When the distance is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), the program checks if `ya` falls within the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`. If `ya` is within this range, it prints 'Alice'. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

4. **Even Distance Case**: When the distance is even, the program checks if `yb` falls within the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`. If `yb` is within this range, it prints 'Bob'. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly determine the outcome of each test case based on the rules provided. The program correctly handles the edge cases and the logic for determining the winner or a draw.

Correctness: **True**
