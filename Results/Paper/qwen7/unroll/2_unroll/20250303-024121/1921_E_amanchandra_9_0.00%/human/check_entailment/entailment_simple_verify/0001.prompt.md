You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Draw', 'Alice', and 'Bob' based on the conditions specified within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if `xa > xb`, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the value of `x` as half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`. Depending on whether this difference is odd or even, it then determines the range `[l, r]` and checks if the vertical position `ya` or `yb` falls within certain conditions to decide whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins. If neither condition is met, it prints 'Draw'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers: `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if `xa > xb`.
     - If true, it prints "Draw". This condition is incorrect because it doesn't consider the game dynamics properly.
     - If false, it proceeds to calculate the possible moves and outcomes.

3. **Calculating Moves**:
   - `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`: This calculates the maximum possible distance between the two players in terms of rows.
   - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true, it means the difference in rows is odd.
     - In this case, the program calculates the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
     - It then checks if the vertical distance from `ya` to any boundary (`l` or `r`) is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
     - If true, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
   - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is false, it means the difference in rows is even.
     - In this case, the program calculates the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
     - It then checks if the vertical distance from `yb` to any boundary (`l` or `r`) is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If true, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

### Correctness Evaluation:

1. **Incorrect Initial Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if xa > xb:` is incorrect. The game dynamics should be considered more carefully, not just the initial row positions.

2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the game rules. Specifically, it does not account for the diagonal moves and the fact that players can only move towards each other under certain conditions.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the calculated ranges and distances is flawed. It does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when the players are very close to the boundaries or when the board size is small.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the game logic and fails to determine the outcome of the game based on the optimal strategies of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
