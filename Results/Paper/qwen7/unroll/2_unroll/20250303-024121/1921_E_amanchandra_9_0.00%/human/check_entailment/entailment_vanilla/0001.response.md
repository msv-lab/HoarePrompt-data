Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers: `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if `xa > xb`.
     - If true, it prints "Draw". This condition is incorrect because it doesn't consider the game dynamics properly.
     - If false, it proceeds to calculate the possible moves and outcomes.

3. **Calculating Moves**:
   - `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`: This calculates the maximum possible distance between the two players in terms of rows.
   - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true, it means the difference in rows is odd.
     - In this case, the program calculates the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
     - It then checks if the vertical distance from `ya` to any boundary (`l` or `r`) is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
     - If true, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
   - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is false, it means the difference in rows is even.
     - In this case, the program calculates the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
     - It then checks if the vertical distance from `yb` to any boundary (`l` or `r`) is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If true, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

### Correctness Evaluation:

1. **Incorrect Initial Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if xa > xb:` is incorrect. The game dynamics should be considered more carefully, not just the initial row positions.

2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the game rules. Specifically, it does not account for the diagonal moves and the fact that players can only move towards each other under certain conditions.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the calculated ranges and distances is flawed. It does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when the players are very close to the boundaries or when the board size is small.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the game logic and fails to determine the outcome of the game based on the optimal strategies of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
