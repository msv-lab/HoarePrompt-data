Reasoning:

1. **Test Cases Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each one individually.
2. **Initial Comparison**: The function correctly identifies when `xa` (Alice's row) is greater than `xb` (Bob's row), which leads to a draw as per the problem statement. This part is handled correctly.
3. **Distance Calculation**: The function calculates the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` and checks if this difference is odd or even. This is a crucial step in determining the winner.
4. **Range Calculation**: Based on the parity of the distance, the function calculates the range of valid positions for the opponent's chip (`l` and `r`). It then checks if the current chip's position (`ya` or `yb`) falls within this range.
5. **Decision Making**: The function makes the correct decision based on whether the current chip's position falls within the calculated range. If it does, the function determines the winner; otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

Given the detailed execution summary and the analysis above, the function appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly according to the provided rules and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
