Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000; `s` is a list containing all characters from `sChar`; `left` is 0; `cost` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cost` to 0. Since `sChar` is a binary string, `s` is a list of its characters, and `left` is already initialized to 0, these values remain unchanged. The only new information is that `cost` is now set to 0.
