#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The adjacency list adj is constructed based on the input edges, where adj[v] is a list of vertices adjacent to vertex v. The variable x represents a potential size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The variables L and R represent the search range for binary search, initialized to 1 and 100001 respectively. The variable numCuts keeps track of the number of edges removed during the DFS traversal, and leftover represents the number of vertices in the largest connected component found during the DFS traversal.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for z in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        L = 1
        
        R = int(100000.0 + 1)
        
        numCuts = 0
        
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            leftover = dfs(1, 1)
            if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x
        
        print(L)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `sys.stdin.readline()` is called to read the next line which will contain the value of `t`, for each of the `t` cases, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n` ≤ 10^5, `adj` is the adjacency list constructed based on the input edges, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` keeps track of the number of edges removed during the DFS traversal, and `leftover` represents the number of vertices in the largest connected component found during the DFS traversal, after executing the binary search to find the maximum size of the largest connected component that can remain after removing `k` edges, the result `L` is printed for each case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes the number of vertices (n), the number of edges to remove (k), and the adjacency list (adj) representing the graph. It then performs a binary search to find the maximum size of the largest connected component that can remain after removing k edges. Finally, it prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum possible size of the largest remaining connected component.
