t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The adjacency list adj is constructed based on the input edges, where adj[v] is a list of vertices adjacent to vertex v. The variable x represents a potential size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The variables L and R represent the search range for binary search, initialized to 1 and 100001 respectively. The variable numCuts keeps track of the number of edges removed during the DFS traversal, and leftover represents the number of vertices in the largest connected component found during the DFS traversal.
