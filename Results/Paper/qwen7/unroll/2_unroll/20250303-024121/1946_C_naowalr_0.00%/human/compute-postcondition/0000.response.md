Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `sys.stdin.readline()` is called to read the next line which will contain the value of `t`, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n` ≤ 10^5, `adj` is the adjacency list constructed based on the input edges, `x` represents a potential size of each remaining connected component after removing `k` edges, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` keeps track of the number of edges removed during the DFS traversal, and `leftover` represents the number of vertices in the largest connected component found during the DFS traversal.**

The code reads the first line from standard input, which should contain the value of `t`. All other variables remain in their initial state, with `L` and `R` set to 1 and 100001 respectively, and `numCuts` and `leftover` initialized to 0. The adjacency list `adj` and the integers `n` and `k` are yet to be defined based on subsequent inputs.
