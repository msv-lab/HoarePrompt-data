### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to confirm this conclusion.

1. **Reading Test Cases and Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - It splits the input string to get `a` and `b` from the input.

2. **Iterating Over Possible Pairs:**
   - The original code had nested loops iterating over possible values of `i` and `j`. However, this part was commented out.
   - Instead, the program uses a different approach where it iterates over `i` from 1 to `b`.

3. **Calculating `x`:**
   - The expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` seems to be an attempt to calculate something related to the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
   - The term `x` is added to `suma`, which accumulates the count of valid pairs.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` before adding `x` to `suma`. This ensures that the division operation does not result in a negative value, which could happen if `a < i * (i - 1)`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The final output is `suma - 1`, which subtracts one from the accumulated count. This might be a mistake or an optimization, but we need to verify if it aligns with the problem statement.

### Detailed Verification Against Example

Let's verify the logic using the example provided:

- For the input `2 3`:
  - Valid pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)
  - The program should output `3`.
  - Let's check the calculation:
    - For `i = 1`: \( x = (2 - 1 \cdot 0) // 1^2 + 1 = 3 \)
    - For `i = 2`: \( x = (2 - 2 \cdot 1) // 2^2 + 1 = 0 \)
    - Sum: `3 + 0 = 3`
    - Final output: `3 - 1 = 2` (which is incorrect)

- For the input `3 5`:
  - Valid pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1)
  - The program should output `5`.
  - Let's check the calculation:
    - For `i = 1`: \( x = (3 - 1 \cdot 0) // 1^2 + 1 = 4 \)
    - For `i = 2`: \( x = (3 - 2 \cdot 1) // 2^2 + 1 = 1 \)
    - For `i = 3`: \( x = (3 - 3 \cdot 2) // 3^2 + 1 = 0 \)
    - Sum: `4 + 1 + 0 = 5`
    - Final output: `5 - 1 = 4` (which is incorrect)

### Correct Implementation

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \( (a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0 \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, a + 1):
            for j in range(1, b + 1):
                if (i + j) % (j * gcd(i, j)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). The given solution iterates over all possible pairs and checks the condition directly, ensuring correctness.
