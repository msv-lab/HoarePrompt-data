Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since `T` is a positive integer and the initial state specified that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the updated state for `T` is that it is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
