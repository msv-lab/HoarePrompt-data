Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m. For each test case, the function checks if the conditions 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 are met and if the sum of n and m does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6 across all test cases. The function returns a result based on these conditions for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to validate a set of test cases involving pairs of integers (n, m) under specified constraints and return appropriate results for each valid test case.
