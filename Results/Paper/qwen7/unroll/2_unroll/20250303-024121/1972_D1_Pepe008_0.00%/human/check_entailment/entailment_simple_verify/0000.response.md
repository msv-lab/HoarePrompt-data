### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

#### Problem Requirements:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program iterates over all values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), it calculates a value \(x\) using the formula:
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]
where \(i\) ranges from 1 to \(b\). If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to the sum.

However, this formula does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided code does not actually check this condition for each pair \((a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition:
\[ (a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0 \]

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the program's flow:
1. The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
2. For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
3. It then iterates over all values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula mentioned above.
4. Finally, it prints the sum minus one for each test case.

Given the annotations, we can see that the program does not correctly implement the required logic. It does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

Final: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
