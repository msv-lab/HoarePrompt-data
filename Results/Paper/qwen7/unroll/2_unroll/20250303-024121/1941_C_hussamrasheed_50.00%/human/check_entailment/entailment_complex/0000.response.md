Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` after removing all instances of "map". However, this approach is flawed because it does not actually make the string beautiful. Instead, it calculates the number of "pie" occurrences in the remaining string after removing "map", which does not guarantee the minimum deletions needed to make the string beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, we should aim to remove the minimum number of characters such that neither "map" nor "pie" appears in the string. The current implementation only removes "map" but does not handle "pie".

Here's why the current solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the modified string (after removing "map"), but this does not reflect the minimum deletions required to make the string beautiful. It only provides a count of "pie" occurrences in the remaining string, which is not relevant for determining the minimum deletions.

2. **No Handling of "pie"**: The program does not account for the removal of "pie" at all, which is a necessary step to make the string beautiful.

3. **Output Mismatch**: The expected output is the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful, but the current program outputs the sum of counts of "map" and "pie" after removing "map", which is not the correct measure of deletions.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
