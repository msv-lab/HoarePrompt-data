Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a total length not exceeding 10^6. For each test case, it returns a result based on the value of `t` and the content of `s`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific result for each test case based on the given conditions.
