### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly identifies whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.
   
2. **Identifying Shapes:**
   - The program initializes two variables `a` and `b`. 
     - `a` is used to store the result if a triangle is found.
     - `b` is used to store the result if a square is found.
   - For each row in the grid, it checks the number of `1`s:
     - If a row contains exactly one `1`, it sets `a` to `'TRIANGLE'`.
     - If a row contains more than one `1`, it sets `b` to `'SQUARE'`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all rows, the program prints the value of `a` if it is non-zero, otherwise it prints the value of `b`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangles:**
   - The program checks if a row contains exactly one `1` to identify a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to identify a triangle. A triangle can have multiple rows with more than one `1`, as long as they form a triangular pattern.
   - For example, consider a grid with a triangle of size `k=3`:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     The second and third rows both contain two `1`s, but the entire shape is still a triangle.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Squares:**
   - The program checks if a row contains more than one `1` to identify a square. This is also not sufficient because a square can have rows with only one `1` if the `1`s are aligned properly.
   - For example, consider a grid with a square of size `k=3`:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     The second and third rows both contain two `1`s, but the entire shape is still a square.

3. **Incomplete Logic:**
   - The program does not check the actual pattern of `1`s to ensure they form a triangle or a square. It only checks the count of `1`s in each row, which is insufficient for determining the shape.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the logic for identifying triangles and squares, the provided program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
