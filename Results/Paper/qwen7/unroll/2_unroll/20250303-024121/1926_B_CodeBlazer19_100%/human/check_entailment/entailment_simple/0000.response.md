Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to determine whether the grid represents a triangle or a square.
2. The logic in the program is flawed because it checks each row individually to see if it contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1'. This approach does not correctly identify the shape because:
   - For a triangle, multiple rows will have more than one '1'.
   - For a square, only one row will have exactly one '1' if we consider the entire grid.
3. The program should instead check the structure of the grid to identify the shape:
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row increases by 2 from the top to the middle and then decreases symmetrically.
   - For a square, the number of '1's in each row is constant and equal to the side length of the square.
4. The current implementation will incorrectly identify many test cases as 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' due to its flawed logic.

Correctness: **False**
