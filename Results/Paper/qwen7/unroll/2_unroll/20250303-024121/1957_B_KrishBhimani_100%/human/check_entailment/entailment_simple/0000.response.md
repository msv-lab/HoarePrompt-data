Reasoning:

1. The program correctly handles the case when `n` is 1 by simply printing `k`.
2. For the case when `n` is greater than 1, the program aims to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. This is achieved by constructing a sequence that includes `(2^i - 1)` and `(k - (2^i - 1))`, followed by enough zeros to make the list length equal to `n`.

3. The logic for determining `i` (the highest power of 2 less than `k`) is correct. It iteratively doubles `temp` until it exceeds `k`, ensuring that `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.

4. The sequence construction:
   - `(1 << i) - 1` generates a number with `i` bits all set to 1, which is the maximum possible value with `i` bits.
   - `(k - (1 << i) + 1)` ensures that the remaining part of `k` is included in the sequence.
   - Adding zeros to make the sequence length `n` ensures that the total sum is `k`.

5. The program outputs the constructed sequence for each test case, which satisfies the conditions given in the problem statement.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
