Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine which character ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each string of length 5. The program iterates through each character in the input string, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', and then prints the character that has the higher count. This logic is accurate and should produce the correct output for the given example and any other valid input within the specified constraints.
