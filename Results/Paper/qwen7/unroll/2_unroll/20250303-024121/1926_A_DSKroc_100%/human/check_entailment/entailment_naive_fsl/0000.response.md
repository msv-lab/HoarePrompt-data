Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all possible cases correctly. Since the string length is fixed at 5 and can only contain 'A' or 'B', the logic to count and compare the frequencies works without any issues. The program processes each test case independently and outputs the correct result for each, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
