Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `q` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive.
   - No other variables are mentioned as being affected or changed by the loop head.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `q < t`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `t` is the only variable that affects the loop's execution and it must be greater than 0, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 (the smallest possible value within the given range).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
