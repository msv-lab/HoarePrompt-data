Output State: **`casos` is an input integer between 1 and 20 inclusive, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from input and assigns it to the variable `casos`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 20. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 for each test case is not yet applicable since `n` has not been assigned a value yet.
