Reasoning:

1. The problem requires generating a 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern where each 2x2 block alternates between `#` and `.`.
2. The given solution only handles specific cases for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`. It does not provide a general solution for any `n` within the specified range.
3. For `n > 4`, the program incorrectly prints "No esta en el rango" which translates to "It is not in the range". This is incorrect because the problem specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`.
4. The solution should use a loop to generate the pattern for any `n` within the given range.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible values of `n` and does not follow the required pattern for larger values of `n`.

Correctness: **False**
