Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly generate the required 2n Ã— 2n checkerboard pattern for any input value of \( n \). Specifically, the program uses hardcoded patterns for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \), but it fails to generalize this pattern for other values of \( n \). For \( n > 4 \), the program prints "No esta en el rango", which is not part of the checkerboard pattern and does not fulfill the requirement of generating the correct checkerboard.

Moreover, even for the hardcoded cases, the program does not follow the checkerboard pattern correctly. For example, when \( n = 2 \), the expected output should be a 4x4 checkerboard, but the provided code only prints 4 lines instead of 4x4 = 16 lines. Similarly, for \( n = 3 \), the expected output would be a 6x6 checkerboard, but the provided code only prints 6 lines instead of 6x6 = 36 lines.

To fix this, the program needs to dynamically generate the checkerboard pattern for any \( n \) within the given constraints.

Correctness: **False**
