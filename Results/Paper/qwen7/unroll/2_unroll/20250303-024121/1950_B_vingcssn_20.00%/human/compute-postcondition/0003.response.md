Output State: The output will consist of multiple patterns printed based on the value of `n` for each iteration of the loop. If `n` is 1, two lines of "##" will be printed. If `n` is 2, four lines of specific patterns will be printed. If `n` is 3, six lines of specific patterns will be printed. If `n` is 4, eight lines of specific patterns will be printed. If `n` is greater than 4, the message "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range") will be printed for each case outside the specified range. The total number of these patterns will depend on the value of `casos`, which is the number of times the loop runs.
