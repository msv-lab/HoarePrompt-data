You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Program:
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `casos` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. Depending on the value of `n`, it prints a specific pattern consisting of "#" and "." characters. If `n` is 1, it prints two lines of "##". If `n` is 2, it prints four lines with specific patterns. If `n` is 3, it prints six lines with specific patterns. If `n` is 4, it prints eight lines with specific patterns. If `n` is greater than 4, it prints "No esta en el rango" for each case. The function does not return anything and only outputs the patterns or the out-of-range message.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program only handles specific cases (n=1, n=2, n=3, and n=4) and includes a fallback message for other values of `n`. However, the problem description requires generating a 2n × 2n checkerboard for any `n` within the range [1, 20]. The program fails to generate the correct pattern for `n > 4`, such as `n=5` or `n=6`, which are also within the valid range. For instance, for `n=5`, the output should be a 10x10 checkerboard, but the program does not handle this case correctly.
