Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally against an opponent who also plays optimally. However, the program simply counts the occurrences of each unique element in every second line of the input and divides the count by 3, which is unrelated to the game logic described.

Specifically, the program:
- Reads the input but does not process the specific details of the cards in your hand or the optimal strategy for playing the game.
- Does not simulate the game or consider the optimal moves for either player.
- Simply counts occurrences of each unique element and divides by 3, which is irrelevant to the game's scoring system.

Given that the program does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem correctly, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
