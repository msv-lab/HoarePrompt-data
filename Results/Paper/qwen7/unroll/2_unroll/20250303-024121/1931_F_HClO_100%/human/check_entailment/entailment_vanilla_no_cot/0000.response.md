Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of `m == 1` Case**: The code correctly handles the case where `m == 1`, but it prints 'yes' instead of 'YES', which might not match the required format.

2. **Logic for Comparing Screenshot Lists**: The logic for comparing the lists `l11` and `l22` is flawed. It should ensure that the remaining elements in both lists are the same after removing the author's position. However, the current implementation only checks if the lists are not equal, which is insufficient.

3. **Insertion Logic**: The insertion logic for the author's position is overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly. For instance, the logic for determining `idx1` and `idx2` and then inserting the author's position might not work as expected in all scenarios.

4. **Validation of Remaining Screenshots**: The validation loop for the remaining screenshots (`val`) is not robust enough. It should check if the positions of the author in the remaining screenshots match the expected positions based on the initial comparison.

To fix these issues, the solution needs to be revised to properly handle the comparison and insertion logic, and ensure that the final output matches the required format.
