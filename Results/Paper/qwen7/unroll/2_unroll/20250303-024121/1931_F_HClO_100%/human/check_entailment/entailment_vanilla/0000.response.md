### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` (the number of participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively).

2. **Single Screenshot Case**:
   - If `m == 1`, the function immediately prints 'yes' without further checks. This is correct because a single screenshot doesn't contradict any other possible order.

3. **Comparing First Two Screenshots**:
   - The function compares the first two screenshots (`a1, l1` and `a2, l2`). It removes the author from both lists and checks if the remaining lists match.
   - If they don't match, it prints 'no' and moves to the next test case. This part is correct.

4. **Finding Insertion Points**:
   - The function attempts to find the correct insertion points for the author of the first screenshot (`a1`) and the second screenshot (`a2`) in the combined list.
   - If the insertion points are found, it inserts the author into the appropriate position and continues checking subsequent screenshots.

5. **Handling Multiple Screenshots**:
   - For multiple screenshots, the function iteratively checks if the current screenshot matches the expected order after inserting the author's position.
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints 'no'. If all screenshots match, it prints 'yes'.

### Analysis:
- The logic for handling the first two screenshots and finding the correct insertion points seems sound.
- The iterative check for subsequent screenshots is also correctly implemented.

### Edge Cases:
- The function handles the edge case where `m == 1` correctly.
- The function correctly identifies when the orders do not match and prints 'no'.
- The function correctly handles the insertion of authors and checks the order of subsequent screenshots.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all cases as required and produces the correct output.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
