State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine how many times it should iterate.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
3. The variables `_` and the loop body are not relevant to adjusting the initial state since they do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.
