Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution seems to be attempting to solve the problem using a complex approach involving prefix sums and accumulations, but it does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement according to the rules specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed.

Here’s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Time**: The function `func_1` is not correctly used to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. The logic inside `func_2` also does not accurately reflect the pinball's movement and the inversion of directions.

2. **Complexity and Logic Errors**: The code uses a lot of complex operations with prefix sums and accumulations, which do not align with the straightforward simulation required for this problem. The logic for handling the pinball's movement and direction inversion needs to be more directly implemented.

3. **Edge Cases**: The provided solution might not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the pinball starts at the boundary cells or when the grid configuration is such that the pinball bounces back and forth multiple times before leaving the grid.

### Correct Approach:
A simpler and more direct approach would involve simulating the pinball's movement step-by-step according to the rules provided. Here’s a high-level outline of what the correct solution should do:

1. **Simulate Movement**: For each query, start from the given cell and follow the rules until the pinball leaves the grid.
2. **Track Time**: Keep track of the time taken for each movement.
3. **Invert Directions**: Invert the direction whenever the pinball hits a cell with the opposite direction.

This approach avoids the complexity of the current solution and directly addresses the problem requirements.
