The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, all of which are integers. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `friendships`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing the indices of a pair of children who are friends and their friendship value, respectively.

The function does not return a specific value directly from the given information, but rather processes the input parameters and `friendships` list to perform some operations. However, based on the parameters and the nature of the input, the function likely aims to handle test cases related to children, their friendships, and excursions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` (all integers) and a list `friendships`. It processes these inputs to handle `t` test cases involving `n` children, `m` pairs of friends, and `k` excursions, based on the friendship values provided.**
