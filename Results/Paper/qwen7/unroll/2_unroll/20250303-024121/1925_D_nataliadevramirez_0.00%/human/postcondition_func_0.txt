The function accepts four parameters: the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), the number of excursions (k), and a list of tuples representing pairs of friends and their friendship values (friendships). It calculates the sum of the friendship values, each multiplied by the combination of k taken 2, and returns this sum modulo a constant MOD.
