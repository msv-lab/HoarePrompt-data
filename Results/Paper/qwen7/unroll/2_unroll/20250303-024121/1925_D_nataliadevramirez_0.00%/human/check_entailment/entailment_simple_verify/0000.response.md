### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
- The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for every excursion if the pair is chosen.
- The probability of choosing a pair is not uniform; it depends on the number of friends each child has.

#### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the sum of the friendship values multiplied by the combination of \( k \) taken 2, modulo \( MOD \), for all \( m \) pairs of friends.
  - The formula used is \( f \times \binom{k}{2} \), which is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of choosing each pair.
  - The combination \( \binom{k}{2} \) represents the number of ways to choose 2 excursions out of \( k \), but it does not reflect the probability of choosing each pair.

- **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - It correctly processes the input and prints the result for each test case.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values because it does not account for the probability of choosing each pair.
- The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect because it assumes uniform probability, which is not the case.

#### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the expected value considering the probability of choosing each pair.
- The expected value for each pair can be calculated as the product of the friendship value and the probability of choosing that pair.
- The probability of choosing a pair is proportional to the number of friends each child in the pair has.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the expected value because it does not account for the probability of choosing each pair.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of choosing each pair, which is a crucial aspect of the problem.
