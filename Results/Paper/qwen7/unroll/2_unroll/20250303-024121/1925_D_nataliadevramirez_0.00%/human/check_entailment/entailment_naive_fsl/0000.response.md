Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the probability of choosing each pair. The formula used in `func_1` assumes that each pair is chosen with equal probability, but it does not take into account the actual probabilities based on the number of friends each child has.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

**Test Case:**
```
3 3 2
1 2 1
2 3 2
1 3 3
```

In this case:
- There are 3 children and 3 pairs of friends.
- Each pair has a friendship value as follows:
  - Pair (1, 2): Value 1
  - Pair (2, 3): Value 2
  - Pair (1, 3): Value 3

For each excursion, the teacher chooses a pair of children randomly. The probability of choosing each pair is not uniform because the number of friends each child has affects the probability. For instance, child 2 is part of two pairs, while child 1 and child 3 are part of one pair each.

The correct approach would involve calculating the probability of choosing each pair and then using these probabilities to compute the expected value. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
