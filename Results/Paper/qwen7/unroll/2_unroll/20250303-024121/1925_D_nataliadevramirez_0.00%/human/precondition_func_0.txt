n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively. The friendship values are non-negative integers, and all pairs of friends are distinct. The constants MOD and friendships are defined elsewhere in the program.
