t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30; the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30; and the third line is empty or contains additional input which should be ignored.
