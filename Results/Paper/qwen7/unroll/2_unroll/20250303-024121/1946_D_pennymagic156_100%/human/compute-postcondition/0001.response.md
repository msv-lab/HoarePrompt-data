Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x < 2^30, and `a` is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, after calling `func_1()` to update the list `a`.**

The code `a = func_1()` updates the list `a` by calling the function `func_1()`. However, since the exact implementation of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of the elements in the list `a`. Therefore, the only change is that the list `a` has been updated, while `n` and `x` remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
