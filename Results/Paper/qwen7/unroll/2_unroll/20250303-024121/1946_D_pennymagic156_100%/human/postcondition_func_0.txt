The function processes user input for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. After processing all test cases, it returns a list of integers obtained from the user input, split and converted to integers.
