Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x < 2^30, and `a` is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, but now `n` and `x` have been updated by the function `func_3()`**.

The code `n, x = func_3()` calls the function `func_3()`, which returns two values, `n` and `x`. These values replace the previous values of `n` and `x`, but the precondition that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x < 2^30 remains valid. The list `a` is unchanged.
