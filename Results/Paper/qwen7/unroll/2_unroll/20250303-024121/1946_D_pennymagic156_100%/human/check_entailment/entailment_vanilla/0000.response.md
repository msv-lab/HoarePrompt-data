### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input using custom functions `func_1` and `func_2`. This part is correct and handles the input as expected.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_5` processes the input and initializes necessary variables.
   - It iterates over bits from 29 down to 0 (since \(x < 2^{30}\)).
   - For each bit position, it checks if the bit of \(x\) is set and whether the corresponding bit in the array elements is set.
   - If both bits are zero, it skips further processing for that bit.
   - If the bit of \(x\) is zero but the sum of the corresponding bits in the array is odd, it returns the current answer.
   - If the bit of \(x\) is zero and the sum is even, it splits the array into segments based on the bit pattern.
   - If the bit of \(x\) is one and the sum of the corresponding bits in the array is odd, it skips further processing for that bit.
   - If the bit of \(x\) is one and the sum is even, it counts the number of segments that can be formed.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum count of segments found.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic handles the edge case where no valid segments can be formed by breaking out of the loop when all bits are zero.
   - The logic also handles the case where the entire array can be used as a segment if no valid segments can be formed with any bit.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the result as required.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
