Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and the constraints specified in the problem statement.
2. The logic within the loop is designed to calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all icons given the constraints:
   - For each test case, it first checks if there are both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
   - It calculates how many 2x2 icons can fit into the available space (`bxsfory`), which is derived from the formula `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - Then, it adjusts the count of 1x1 icons (`x`) to account for the space taken by 2x2 icons.
   - It further calculates how many additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons (`bxsfory1`), using the formula `math.ceil(x / 15)` since each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.
   - Finally, it sums the results to get the total number of screens required.
3. The program correctly handles edge cases where either `x` or `y` is zero, providing the appropriate number of screens.
4. The program iterates over all test cases as expected and prints the result for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
