State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head is `for _ in range(nabors):`.
2. The only variable in the loop head is `nabors`.
3. For the loop to execute, `nabors` must be a positive integer because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and if `nabors` is less than or equal to 0, no iterations will occur.
4. Given that `1 ≤ nabors ≤ 10^4`, the only condition we need to ensure for the loop to execute is that `nabors` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `nabors` must be greater than 0.
