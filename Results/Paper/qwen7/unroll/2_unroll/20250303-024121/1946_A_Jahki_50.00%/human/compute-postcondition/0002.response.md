Output State: `num` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer, `op` is the number of operations performed during the loop execution.

Explanation: The loop processes each value of `num2` up to `num`. For each `num2`, it reads a list of numbers from the user input, sorts them, and calculates the median. If `num2` is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers; if odd, it calculates it as the middle number. It then increments the middle elements until the new median exceeds the old median, counting the number of operations needed. If `num2` exceeds 10000, it prints 1 and 16668 and breaks out of the loop. The final state of `op` will be the total number of operations performed across all iterations of the loop.
