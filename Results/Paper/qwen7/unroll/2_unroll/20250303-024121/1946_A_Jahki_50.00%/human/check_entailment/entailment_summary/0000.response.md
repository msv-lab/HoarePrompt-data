Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`) and iterates through each test case. It also handles the condition where `num2` (the length of the array) is greater than 10000, printing 1 and 16668 and breaking the loop, which matches the problem statement.

2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, the function correctly converts the input string into a list of integers `a` and sorts it to find the median. This part is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

3. **Median Calculation**: The function calculates the median correctly based on whether the length of the array is even or odd. This is done using the formula `ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1` for even lengths and `ma = int(num2 / 2)` for odd lengths.

4. **Increment Operations**: The function enters a loop where it increments the element at position `ma` until the new median is greater than the old median. This ensures that the median is increased, and the number of operations is counted correctly.

5. **Output**: The function prints the number of operations required to increase the median for each valid test case, which is the expected output format.

Given the above points, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
