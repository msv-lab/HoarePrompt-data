Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `num` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `num = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `num`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer, and `num` now holds the value of the integer input provided by the user.
