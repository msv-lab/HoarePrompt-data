Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and two binary strings `a_{1}` and `a_{2}` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the comparison of these binary strings for each test case.**

This means the function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and two binary strings of length `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, but the specific nature of the return value is not detailed in the provided information.
