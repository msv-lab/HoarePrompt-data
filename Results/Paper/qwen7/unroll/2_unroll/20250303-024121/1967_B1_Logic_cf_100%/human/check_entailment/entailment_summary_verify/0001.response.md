### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function Summary Recap
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates a value \(ans\) using a specific formula involving \(n\) and \(b\) (where \(b\) ranges from 2 to the minimum of \(n\) and \(m\)). The function then prints the calculated \(ans\) for each test case.

#### Original Program Analysis
The original program initializes `ans` to `n` and then iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 2 to the minimum of \(n\) and \(m\), updating `ans` using the expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\). This expression does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is the correct implementation:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, min(a, m) + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This implementation correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by checking the condition for each pair.

### Evaluation

Given the analysis, the original program is indeed incorrect because it does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs and checking the condition directly.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
