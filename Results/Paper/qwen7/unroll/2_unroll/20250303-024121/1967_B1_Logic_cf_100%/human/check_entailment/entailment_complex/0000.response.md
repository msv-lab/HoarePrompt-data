Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The key issue lies in the formula used to calculate `ans`. Specifically, the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not accurately reflect the condition that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over possible values of `a` and check for each `a` whether there exists a `b` such that the condition is satisfied. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

# State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each T in range(t), there is a corresponding count calculated based on the given condition, and these count values are printed for each iteration.
```

Explanation:
- We use nested loops to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
- For each pair, we check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- If the condition is satisfied, we increment the count.
- Finally, we print the count for each test case.

Given the above explanation, the original program is incorrect because it does not properly check the condition for each pair `(a, b)`. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
