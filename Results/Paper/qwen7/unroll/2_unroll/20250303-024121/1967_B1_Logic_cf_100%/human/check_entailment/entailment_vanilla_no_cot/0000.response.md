Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Condition Check**: The problem requires that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided code does not check this condition at all. Instead, it simply increments `ans` by \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not reflect the required condition. This calculation does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Missing gcd Calculation**: The program does not calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` for each pair, which is essential for checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected program iterates through all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count `ans`.
