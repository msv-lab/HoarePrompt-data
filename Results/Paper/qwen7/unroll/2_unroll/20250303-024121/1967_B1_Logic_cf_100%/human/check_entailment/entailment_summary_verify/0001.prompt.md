You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value \( ans \) using a specific formula involving \( n \) and \( b \) (where \( b \) ranges from 2 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \)). The function then prints the calculated \( ans \) for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes `ans` to `n`, which seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of `b`:**
   - The loop iterates over possible values of `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
   - Inside the loop, it updates `ans` using the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)`.

### Key Points to Check

1. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - For a fixed `b`, we need to check how many `a` satisfy this condition within the range `[1, n]`.

2. **Expression `(n + b) // (b * b)`:**
   - This expression does not correctly implement the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - It simply adds `b` to `n` and divides by `b * b`, which is not related to the actual condition.

3. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The program does not calculate the GCD of `a` and `b` for each pair `(a, b)`, which is necessary to check the condition properly.

### Example Verification

Let's verify with the example provided:

- For the test case `10 8`:
  - The expected output is `14`.
  - The program's logic does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Correct Implementation

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if they satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, min(a, m) + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
