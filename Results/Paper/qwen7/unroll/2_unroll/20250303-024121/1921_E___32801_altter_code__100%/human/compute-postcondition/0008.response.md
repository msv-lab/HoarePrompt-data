Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each part to an integer.
- `n` is the first element of `r`.
- `m` is the second element of `r`.
- `x1` is the third element of `r`.
- `y1` is the fourth element of `r`.
- `x2` is the fifth element of `r`.
- `y2` is the sixth element of `r`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- `(x2 - x1)` is not divisible by 2.
- The current value of `y1` is equal to the current value of `y2`.

The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Alice'`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) are not relevant to the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **Alice**
