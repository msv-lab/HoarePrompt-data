Postcondition: **`r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is two more than its original value, `y1` is one less than its original value, `y2` is either 1 or equal to `m`, `x2` is always greater than `x1` and currently is decreased by `a`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is decreased by `a` and is now greater than `x1`, `a` is an integer, `c` is either `y1 - 1` or `m - y1`. The value of `b // 2` is greater than `a`, the absolute difference between `x2` and `c` is greater than or equal to the sum of `x1` and `c`, `1` is less than or equal to `y1` and less than or equal to `m`, and `1` is less than or equal to `x1` and less than or equal to `n`.**
