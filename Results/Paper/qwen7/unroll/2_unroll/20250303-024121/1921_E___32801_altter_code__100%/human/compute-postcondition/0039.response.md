Output State: **`r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is two more than its original value, `y1` is one less than its original value minus `a`, `y2` is 1, `x2` is always greater than `x1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`, and `(x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n)`**

In this output state, the only change is that `y1` is updated to be one less than its original value minus `a`. All other variables retain their initial relationships and values as described in the initial state.
