Postcondition: `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `c` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on whether `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `(b // 2 <= a) or (abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c) or (y1 < 1) or (y1 > m) or (x1 < 1) or (x1 > n)` is true.
