Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tt`) and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. This part is correct.

2. **Case Analysis for Alice's Winning Condition**:
   - When `x2 > x1`, the program checks if `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`. If true, it proceeds to check if `y1 == y2`. If so, it prints "Alice" and returns, indicating Alice can win directly if she can align vertically with Bob and move down to capture him.
   - If `y1 != y2`, it adjusts the positions of Alice and Bob to try to align them vertically. Then, it calculates the distance `a` and `b` and checks if Alice can force a win by moving closer to Bob.

3. **Case Analysis for Bob's Winning Condition**:
   - When `x2 > x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, the program checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Bob" and returns, indicating Bob can win directly if he can align vertically with Alice and move up to capture her.
   - If `y1 != y2`, it adjusts the positions similarly and calculates the distance `a` and `b`. Then, it checks if Bob can force a win by moving closer to Alice.

4. **Draw Conditions**:
   - The program correctly handles scenarios where neither player can force a win, leading to a draw.

5. **Boundary Checks**:
   - The program ensures that moves stay within the board boundaries and handles cases where players cannot make further moves.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program logic appears to correctly handle all described scenarios and boundary conditions. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
