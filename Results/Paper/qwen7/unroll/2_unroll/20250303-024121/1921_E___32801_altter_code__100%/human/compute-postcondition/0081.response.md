Postcondition: **`t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `c` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on whether `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after executing the if-else block. It indicates that `t` remains as the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, while `c` takes on different values based on the condition of `y1 <= y2`. The values of `b`, `x1`, `x2`, and their constraints remain unchanged regardless of the condition.
