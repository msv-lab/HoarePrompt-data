Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the outcome of the game. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Initial Conditions**: The program does not properly handle the initial positions of the chips and the rules of movement. Specifically, it does not correctly simulate the movements and the conditions under which Alice or Bob can win.

2. **Incomplete Logic**: The program contains several conditional checks but lacks a comprehensive strategy to determine the winner based on optimal play. It does not fully account for all possible scenarios where Alice or Bob can force a win.

3. **Lack of Optimal Play Consideration**: The program does not consider the optimal strategies for both players. It only checks a few specific conditions without a general approach to determine the winner.

4. **Return Statements**: The program uses `return` statements inappropriately, leading to incomplete or incorrect outputs. For example, it should return "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the outcome of the game, but the current implementation does not achieve this consistently.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
