Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `c` is `m - y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `c = m - y2` assigns the value of `m - y2` to the variable `c`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
