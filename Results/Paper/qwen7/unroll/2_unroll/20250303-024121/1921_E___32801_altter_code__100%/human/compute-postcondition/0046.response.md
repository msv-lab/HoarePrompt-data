Postcondition: **`r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is two more than its original value, `y1` is one less than its original value, `y2` is either 1 or equal to `m`, `x2` is always greater than `x1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, and `(x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n)`, and `c` is either `y1 - 1` or `m - y1`.**
