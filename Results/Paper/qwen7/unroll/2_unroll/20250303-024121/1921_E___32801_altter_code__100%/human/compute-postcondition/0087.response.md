Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
- `c` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on whether `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`.
- `b` is `x2 - x1`.
- `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`.
- `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.

Additionally, the condition `(b // 2 <= a) or (abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c) or (y1 < 1) or (y1 > m) or (x1 < 1) or (x1 > n)` is true.

The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'draw'`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
