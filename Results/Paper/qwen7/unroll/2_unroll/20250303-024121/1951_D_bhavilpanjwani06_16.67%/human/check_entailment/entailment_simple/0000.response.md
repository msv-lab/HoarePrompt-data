Reasoning:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The program only calls `func_1()` but does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement. It should process each test case separately within a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining if Bob Can Fulfill the Task**:
   - The program does not generate stalls and set prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Instead, it checks if `n >= k` and prints "YES" or "NO" based on this comparison.
   - For the case where `n > k`, the program attempts to set up stalls with specific prices but does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The logic for setting up stalls and their prices is missing.

3. **Output Format**:
   - If the answer is "YES", the program should output the number of stalls and the prices for those stalls. However, the current implementation does not generate these values correctly.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
