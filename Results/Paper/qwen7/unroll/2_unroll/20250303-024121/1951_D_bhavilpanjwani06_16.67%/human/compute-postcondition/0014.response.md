Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is greater than `k`.
- \(k - 1 \geq n - k + 1\).

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
