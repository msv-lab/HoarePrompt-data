Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Check the Given States**:
   - `l` is 0 (not relevant for the loop).
   - `n` is a positive integer (relevant for the loop).
   - `m` is a positive integer (not relevant for the loop).
   - `a` is a list of positive integers (not relevant for the loop).
   - `s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n` (not relevant for the loop).
   - `b` is an empty list (not relevant for the loop).
   - `r` is `n - 1` (not relevant for the loop).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
   - `i` should start from 0, which is the default value for `range(n)`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` should start from 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
