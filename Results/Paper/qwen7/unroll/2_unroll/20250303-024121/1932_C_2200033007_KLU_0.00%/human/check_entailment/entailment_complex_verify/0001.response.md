### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - The problem requires processing a series of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a` of length `n` and calculating the remainder of the product of the remaining elements after each command.
   - The commands are processed one by one, and after each command, the corresponding element is removed from the array.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to traverse the string `s` and collect elements from `a` based on the direction specified by each character in `s`.
   - However, the function incorrectly appends elements to `b` without performing any calculations or updates to the array `a`.

3. **Main Program Analysis:**
   - The main program correctly reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The output of `func_1` is printed, but as the function is not correctly implemented, the output is incorrect.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotation states that `b` will contain elements from `a` based on the directions in `s`, but it does not reflect the actual logic of removing elements and calculating the product.
   - The annotation also mentions that `p` is the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order, which is incorrect because `b` is not updated correctly.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To correctly implement the solution, the function should:
     - Maintain a running product of the remaining elements in `a`.
     - Update the product after each command and append the remainder of the product to the result list.
     - Remove the appropriate element from `a` based on the command ('L' or 'R').

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the remainders of the product of the array elements after each command.
   - The function `func_1` does not update the array `a` or calculate the required remainders.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
