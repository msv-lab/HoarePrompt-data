Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of positive integers), and `s` (a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`). It returns a list containing the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order.**

Note: The description assumes that `b` is derived from `a` and `s` according to the instructions but does not detail the exact derivation process as per the given constraints and output description.
