Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for v in reversed(b):`. The variables involved here are `v` and `b`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `b`**: The variable `b` is described as "a list of elements from `a` based on directions in `s`". Since the loop iterates over `reversed(b)`, `b` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `v`**: The variable `v` is the element being iterated over in each step of the loop. For the loop to start, `b` must contain at least one element, and `v` will take the value of the first (last when considering `reversed`) element of `b`.

4. **Consider the Length of `b`**: Since `b` is a list of elements from `a` based on directions in `s`, and `s` is a string of 'L' and 'R' characters, `b` could potentially be empty if no valid elements are selected from `a` based on the directions in `s`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `b` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - `v` will take the value of the first (last when considering `reversed`) element of `b` in the first iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `b` (it must have at least one element) and `v` (it will take the value of the first element of `b`).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`b` is a non-empty list, `v` is the last element in `b`**
