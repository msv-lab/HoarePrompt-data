Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either "Bob" or "Alice", depending on the input pairs (a, b) provided for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, "Bob" will be printed if the absolute difference between a and b is even, and "Alice" will be printed if the absolute difference is odd. The number of lines will be equal to the value of t, which is the input integer between 1 and 1000.
