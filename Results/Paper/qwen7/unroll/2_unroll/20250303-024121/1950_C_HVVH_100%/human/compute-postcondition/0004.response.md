Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1440) and a string `s` ("hh:mm") representing a valid time. It returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.**

However, since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters (`def func():`), the description should focus on the implied parameters and their expected behavior:
