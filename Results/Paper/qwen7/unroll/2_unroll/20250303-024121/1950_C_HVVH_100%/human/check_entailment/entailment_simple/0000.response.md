Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes `day` to 'AM' and reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, splitting the input string `s` into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute).
3. The logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format is as follows:
   - If `h` is 0, it is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
4. The formatted output is printed correctly with leading zeros for both hours and minutes.
5. The final state comment `day is 'AM', n is 0.` is incorrect because `n` should be the number of test cases read, not initialized to 0.

Despite this minor comment error, the logic and implementation of the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format are correct.

Correctness: **True**
