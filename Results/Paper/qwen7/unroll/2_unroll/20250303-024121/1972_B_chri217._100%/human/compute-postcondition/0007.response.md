Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It then constructs a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the values of `n` and `s` for each test case, and returns this list.**
