You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        cases.append((n, s))
    return cases

#Function 2:
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum((1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U'))
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

cases = func_1()
for case in cases:
    print(func_2(case))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of coins, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: Output State: `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` followed by a string `s`. The values of `n` and `s` are read from standard input for each iteration of the loop.
    return cases
    #The program returns a list called 'cases' containing tuples. Each tuple consists of an integer 'n' followed by a string 's', where these values were read from standard input during the iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It then constructs a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the values of `n` and `s` for each test case, and returns this list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a list where the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of each coin (facing up or down).
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #'YES' if the count of 'U' in the second element of `case` is even, otherwise 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `case` where the first element is an integer indicating the number of coins, and the second element is a string representing the initial state of each coin (either "U" for up or "D" for down). It counts the number of coins facing up ("U") and returns 'YES' if this count is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in a list `cases`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function takes a single test case as an argument.
   - It counts the number of coins that are facing up using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
   - It returns "YES" if the count of facing-up coins (`ups`) is even, otherwise "NO".

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game logic described in the problem statement is correctly implemented in the `func_2` function.
   - The key point is that if the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by playing optimally.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob can force Alice into a losing position.

4. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - The output format matches the required format ("YES" or "NO").

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the game logic and handles the input/output as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
