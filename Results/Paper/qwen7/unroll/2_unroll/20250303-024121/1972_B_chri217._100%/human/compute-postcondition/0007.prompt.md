You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of coins, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: Output State: `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` followed by a string `s`. The values of `n` and `s` are read from standard input for each iteration of the loop.
    return cases
    #The program returns a list called 'cases' containing tuples. Each tuple consists of an integer 'n' followed by a string 's', where these values were read from standard input during the iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but reads from standard input a number of test cases (t), and for each test case, it reads the number of coins (n) and a string (s) consisting of "U" and "D". It then returns a list named 'cases' containing tuples, where each tuple includes the values of 'n' and 's' for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list called 'cases' containing tuples. Each tuple consists of an integer 'n' followed by a string 's', where these values were read from standard input during the iterations of the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
