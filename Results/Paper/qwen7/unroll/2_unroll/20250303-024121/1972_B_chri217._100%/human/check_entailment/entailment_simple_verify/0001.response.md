### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case to store the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - The state annotations are accurate, and the function correctly constructs and returns a list of tuples containing the necessary information for each test case.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function counts the number of coins that are facing up using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct. If the count of facing-up coins (`ups`) is even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by playing optimally. If the count is odd, Bob can force Alice into a losing position.
   - The state annotations are accurate, and the function correctly returns "YES" if the count of facing-up coins is even and "NO" otherwise.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game logic described in the problem statement is correctly implemented in the `func_2` function.
   - The key point is that if the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by playing optimally.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob can force Alice into a losing position.

4. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - The output format matches the required format ("YES" or "NO").
   - The annotated code correctly reflects the state transitions and the logic flow.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program and the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the game logic and handles the input/output as specified.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
