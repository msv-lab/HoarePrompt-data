The function accepts a list `case` where the first element is an integer indicating the number of coins, and the second element is a string representing the initial state of each coin (either "U" for up or "D" for down). It counts the number of coins facing up ("U") and returns 'YES' if this count is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'.
