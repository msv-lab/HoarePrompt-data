Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence \(a\) of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
   - No subsequence sums to \(k\).
   - All integers from 1 to \(n\) (except \(k\)) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. **Analyzed Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\).
   - It calculates \(i\) such that \(1 << i + 1\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\).
   - It constructs the list `ans` which includes:
     - \(k - (1 << i)\)
     - \(k + 1\)
     - \(k + 1 + (1 << i)\)
     - Powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{19}\).

3. **Verification**:
   - **No Subsequence Sums to \(k\)**:
     - The value \(k - (1 << i)\) ensures that no subsequence can sum to \(k\) because including \(k - (1 << i)\) and any combination of powers of 2 will not reach \(k\).
     - The value \(k + 1\) and \(k + 1 + (1 << i)\) are included to ensure that no subsequence can sum to \(k\).
   - **Subsequences Summing to All Integers from 1 to \(n\) (Except \(k\))**:
     - The powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{19}\) ensure that any integer from 1 to 20 can be formed.
     - By combining these powers of 2 with \(k + 1\) and \(k + 1 + (1 << i)\), all integers from \(k + 1\) to \(k + 1 + (1 << i)\) can be formed.
     - Since \(n \leq 10^6\), the constructed sequence can always form all integers from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\).

Given the analysis, the code correctly constructs the required sequence for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
