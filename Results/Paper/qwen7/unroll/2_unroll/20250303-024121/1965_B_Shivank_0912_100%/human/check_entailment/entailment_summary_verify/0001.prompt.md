You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` (the number of test cases), and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k`. It calculates and outputs a list `ans` containing specific values derived from `k`. The list includes `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and powers of 2 up to 2^19. Here, `i` is determined such that `1 << i + 1` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. For each test case, it prints the length of the list `ans` followed by its elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - It initializes an index `i` to 0.
   - The loop `while 1 << i + 1 <= k:` finds the largest `i` such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\). This effectively finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - The sequence `ans` is initialized with three values:
     - `k - (1 << i)` which is a value ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k`.
     - `k + 1` which is used to ensure that subsequences can sum to `k + 1`.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)` which is used to ensure that subsequences can sum to `k + 1 + 2^i`.
   - Additional values are appended to `ans` using `1 << j` for `j` ranging from 0 to 19, excluding `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is printed.
   - The sequence `ans` is printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
   - The value `k - (1 << i)` ensures that no subsequence can sum exactly to `k` because any subsequence including this value would have a sum that includes `k - (1 << i)` and possibly other values, but never exactly `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
   - The values `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` along with powers of 2 (`1 << j`) ensure that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by some subsequence.
   - Specifically, the values `1 << j` allow forming all sums from 1 to \(2^{20} - 1\).

3. **Sequence Size Constraint**:
   - The sequence size is at most 25, which is satisfied since the maximum length of `ans` is 23 (3 fixed values + 20 additional values).

### Conclusion:

The program constructs a sequence that meets all the problem requirements. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
