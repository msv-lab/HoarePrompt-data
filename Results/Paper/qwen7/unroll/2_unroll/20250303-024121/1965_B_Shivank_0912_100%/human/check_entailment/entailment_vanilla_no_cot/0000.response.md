Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Constraints and Requirements:**
   - The program attempts to construct a sequence `ans` with specific values to meet the requirements.
   - However, the logic used to generate `ans` may not always produce a valid sequence that meets all the conditions, especially when `n` is large.

2. **Specific Issues:**
   - The approach taken in the program does not guarantee that every integer from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) will have a subsequence summing to it.
   - The construction of `ans` with specific values like `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` might not cover all possible sums required.

3. **Example Counter-Case:**
   - Consider the test case `(n, k) = (9, 3)`. The expected output is `[7, 1, 4, 1]`, but the program's output might not match this requirement because the constructed sequence may not cover all sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

To ensure correctness, the program needs to construct a sequence that explicitly guarantees the conditions are met for all values of `n` and `k`. A more robust approach would involve generating a sequence that includes all necessary sums while ensuring no subsequence sums to `k`.

### Suggested Approach:
A better approach could involve constructing a sequence that includes all numbers from 1 to `n` except `k` and ensures no subsequence sums to `k`. This can be achieved by carefully selecting elements to avoid creating subsequences that sum to `k`.

Here is an improved version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        ans = []
        # Include all numbers from 1 to n except k
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i != k:
                ans.append(i)
        # Ensure the length is at most 25
        if len(ans) > 25:
            ans = ans[:25]
        print(len(ans))
        print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))

func()
```

This approach ensures that all numbers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) are included, and the sequence length is capped at 25, which should meet the problem requirements.
