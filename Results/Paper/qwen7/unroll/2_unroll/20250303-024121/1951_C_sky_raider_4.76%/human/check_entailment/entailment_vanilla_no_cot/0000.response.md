Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. The cost should be calculated based on the ticket prices and the number of tickets purchased each day.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Ticket Purchase**: The loop iterates over the days but incorrectly calculates the cost. It subtracts `s * s / 2` from the total cost `c`, which is not part of the problem's logic. The cost should be `l[i] * s` where `s` is the number of tickets bought on day `i`.

3. **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list `l` before processing is unnecessary and incorrect. The problem requires purchasing tickets in a way that minimizes the total cost, not necessarily in ascending order.

4. **Incorrect Minimization Logic**: The logic to minimize the cost is flawed. The code attempts to buy as many tickets as possible each day, but it doesn't correctly account for the increase in ticket prices after buying tickets.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        k = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        prices = [int(data[i]) for i in range(index, index + n)]
        index += n
        
        dp = [float('inf')] * (k + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            for j in range(k, 0, -1):
                if j >= m:
                    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - m] + m * price)
                else:
                    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - j] + j * price)
        
        results.append(dp[k])
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets, considering the constraints and rules specified in the problem.
