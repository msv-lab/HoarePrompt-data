The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers n, m, and k, and a list of n integers. For each test case, it sorts the list and calculates a value `c` based on the formula \(l[i] \times s - \frac{s \times s}{2}\), where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` after decrementing `k` by `s` in each iteration. Finally, it prints the calculated value `c` for each test case.
