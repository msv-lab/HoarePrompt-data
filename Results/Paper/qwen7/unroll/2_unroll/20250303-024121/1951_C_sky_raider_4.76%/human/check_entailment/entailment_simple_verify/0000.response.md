### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, where the price per ticket on day `i` is `a_i`. The constraints are:
- A person can buy no more than `m` tickets per day.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price per ticket by `x` for all subsequent days.

#### Given Program
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        s = 0
        c = k * k / 2
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
        print(int(c))
```

#### Key Issues in the Given Program
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The program calculates the cost using the formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. This formula does not reflect the actual price increase mechanism described in the problem statement. The term `- s * s / 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the cumulative price increase for subsequent days.
2. **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list `l` before processing is unnecessary and does not affect the result since the order of days does not matter in terms of the price increase mechanism.
3. **Incorrect Price Adjustment**: The program does not correctly adjust the prices for subsequent days after purchasing tickets on a given day.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate through each day.
2. Determine the maximum number of tickets that can be bought on the current day without exceeding the remaining tickets to be bought.
3. Calculate the total cost for the tickets bought on the current day and adjust the prices for subsequent days accordingly.
4. Repeat until all tickets are bought.

#### Example Walkthrough
Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`
- `a = [8, 6, 4, 2]`

**Step-by-Step Execution:**
1. **Day 1**: Buy 2 tickets (since `m = 2`).
   - Cost: `2 * 8 = 16`
   - Remaining tickets: `3 - 2 = 1`
   - Prices for subsequent days: `[6, 4, 2] + 2 = [8, 6, 4]`
2. **Day 2**: Buy 1 ticket (since `k = 1`).
   - Cost: `1 * 8 = 8`
   - Remaining tickets: `1 - 1 = 0`
   - Total cost: `16 + 8 = 24`

The correct answer should be 24, but the given program produces an incorrect result.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It incorrectly calculates the cost and does not properly handle the dynamic adjustment of prices for subsequent days.

**Final: False**
