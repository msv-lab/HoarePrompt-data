Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the list of ticket prices and then iterating through the days to calculate the minimum cost. However, there are several issues with the logic and the formula used in the calculation of `c`.

1. **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list of ticket prices is unnecessary because the algorithm needs to consider the prices in the order they appear, not in sorted order. The problem requires purchasing tickets on specific days based on the current day's price and the subsequent price increase.

2. **Formula Used**: The formula `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. The correct approach should be to calculate the total cost of purchasing `s` tickets on day `i`, which is `l[i] * s`. After purchasing `s` tickets, the price per ticket increases by `s` for all subsequent days. Therefore, the correct formula should simply be `l[i] * s`.

3. **Calculation of `c`**: The variable `c` should accumulate the total cost of purchasing tickets across all days, but the current implementation incorrectly includes a term `- s * s / 2`, which is not part of the correct solution.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **False**
