You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, followed by two binary strings representing the rows of the 2x`n` grid.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Path:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` and a counter `x`.
   - It iterates through the columns from 1 to `n-1`:
     - If `a[0][i+1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', it sets `s` to the prefix of `a[0]` up to `i+1` concatenated with the suffix of `a[1]` starting from `i`. It also sets `x` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If no such column is found, it sets `s` to `a[0]` concatenated with the last element of `a[1]` and sets `x` to `n-1`.

3. **Counting Paths:**
   - The program initializes a counter `t` to 1.
   - It iterates through the columns from 0 to `x-1`:
     - If the prefix of `a[0]` up to `i+1` matches the prefix of `s` up to `i+1`, it updates `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It prints the count of paths `t`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Path:**
   - The logic for finding the smallest path is flawed. The program assumes that the first occurrence of a '1' in the first row and a '0' in the second row will give the smallest path, which is not always true. For example, consider the following grid:
     ```
     011
     100
     ```
     The program would incorrectly set `s` to `0110` because it finds the first '1' in the first row and the first '0' in the second row. However, the correct path should be `000`.

2. **Incorrect Counting of Paths:**
   - The counting logic is also flawed. The program simply counts the number of prefixes that match, which does not necessarily correspond to the number of paths yielding the smallest string. For example, in the grid:
     ```
     001
     110
     ```
     The program would count the paths as 3, but the correct number of paths is 2 (`0010` and `0000`).

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the logic for both finding the smallest path and counting the paths, the program is incorrect.
