Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Path Calculation**:
   - The logic to find the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. The current implementation checks if the first row's next cell is '1' and the current cell in the second row is '0'. This approach doesn't always yield the lexicographically smallest path.
   - The program should consider all possible paths from the top-left to the bottom-right and choose the lexicographically smallest one.

2. **Path Counting**:
   - The counting of paths is also incorrect. The program assumes that once it finds a point where the path changes direction, it counts the remaining cells incorrectly.

3. **Handling All Paths**:
   - The program needs to explore all possible paths from the start to the end, considering both right and down moves, and keep track of the lexicographically smallest path.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def find_smallest_path(a, b, n):
    dp = [[defaultdict(int) for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(3)]
    dp[0][0][''] = 1
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(2):
            for k in range(i + 1):
                for path in dp[j][k]:
                    if j < 1 and a[i][k] == '1':
                        continue
                    if j < 2 and b[i][k] == '1':
                        continue
                    new_path = path + a[i][k] if j < 1 else path + b[i][k]
                    dp[j + 1][i + 1][new_path] += dp[j][k][path]
    
    # Find the lexicographically smallest path
    min_path = None
    for path in dp[2][n]:
        if min_path is None or path < min_path:
            min_path = path
    
    return min_path, dp[2][n][min_path]

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    smallest_path, count = find_smallest_path(a, b, n)
    print(smallest_path)
    print(count)
```

This corrected version uses dynamic programming to explore all paths and keeps track of the lexicographically smallest path and its count.
