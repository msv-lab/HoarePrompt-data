t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The first line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12} … a_{1n} of length n, and the second line contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} … a_{2n} of length n. Both strings consist only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
