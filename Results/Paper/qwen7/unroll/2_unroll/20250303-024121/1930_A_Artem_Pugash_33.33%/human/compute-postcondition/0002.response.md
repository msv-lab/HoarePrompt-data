Output State: **The sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers for each test case.**

Explanation: For each test case (determined by `numCases`), the loop processes two space-separated integers from the input, sorts them, and then repeatedly pops the smallest available number from the sorted list until the list is empty. The sum of these minimum values for all pairs is printed at the end of each test case. After all iterations, the final output state will be the sum of these sums for all test cases.
