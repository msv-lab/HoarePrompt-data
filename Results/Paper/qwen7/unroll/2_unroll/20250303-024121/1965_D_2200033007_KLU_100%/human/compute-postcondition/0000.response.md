Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

2. **Analyze Each Part of the Condition:**
   - `len(smallList) > 0`: This checks if `smallList` has at least one element.
   - `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`: This checks if the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`.

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both parts of the condition must be true.
   - `len(smallList) > 0` must be true, meaning `smallList` must have at least one element.
   - `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` must be true, meaning the last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`.

4. **Check the Initial State:**
   - `bigList` is a list of integers representing the complete set of subarray sums.
   - `smallList` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array.
   - Both lists are non-empty, and their elements are positive integers.

Given these conditions, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` holds true.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute the first time, the last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`bigList` is a list of integers representing the complete set of subarray sums, and `smallList` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array. Both lists are non-empty, and the elements are positive integers. The last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`.**
