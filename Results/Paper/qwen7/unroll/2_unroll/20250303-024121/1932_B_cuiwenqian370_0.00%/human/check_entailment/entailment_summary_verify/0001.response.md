Reasoning:

1. The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided functions do not match the problem description. The problem requires calculating the year when all signs of the apocalypse occur sequentially based on their periodicities. However, the provided code deals with a dynamic programming problem involving characters `@` and `*`, which is unrelated to the actual problem.

2. Let's analyze the function summaries and see if they can help us understand what the intended logic should be:
   - The summary for `func_2` indicates that it processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by an integer `n` (number of signs), and then `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (periodicities of the signs). It then calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the given periodicities and stores these LCM values in a list. Finally, it prints each LCM value from the list.

3. Given the summary, we can infer that the correct approach would involve finding the LCM of the periodicities for each test case. This aligns with the problem description where the signs occur in sequential years based on their periodicities.

4. Since the provided functions do not perform the necessary calculations to find the LCM of the periodicities, the original assessment is accurate. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the provided functions do not implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described.
