Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is not 0; `dp` is a list of length equal to the length of `path`, with all elements initialized to 0; `dp[0]` is either 1 or -inf depending on the first character of `path`; `dp[1]` is -inf if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables `path` and `dp` after the execution of the if-else block. It covers both the if part and the absence of an else part, ensuring that all possible outcomes are accounted for based on the conditions and updates within the if statement.
