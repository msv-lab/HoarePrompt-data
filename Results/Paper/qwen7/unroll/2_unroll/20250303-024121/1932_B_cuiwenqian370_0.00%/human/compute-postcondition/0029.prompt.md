Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is not 0; `dp` is a list of length equal to the length of `path`, with all elements initialized to 0; `dp[0]` is either 1 or -inf depending on the first character of `path`; `dp[1]` is -inf if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables `path` and `dp` after the execution of the if-else block. It covers both the if part and the absence of an else part, ensuring that all possible outcomes are accounted for based on the conditions and updates within the if statement.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, n):
    if path[i] == '*':
        dp[i] = -float('inf')
    else:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
