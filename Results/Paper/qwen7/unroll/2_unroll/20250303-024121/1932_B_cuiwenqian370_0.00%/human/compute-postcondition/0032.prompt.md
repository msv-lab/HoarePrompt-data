You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where the length of the string is at least 1.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is not 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if (path[0] == '@') :
        dp[0] = 1
    else :
        if (path[0] == '*') :
            dp[0] = -float('inf')
        #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is not 0; `dp` is a list of length equal to the length of `path`, with all elements initialized to 0; if the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is set to -inf.
    #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is not 0; `dp` is a list of length equal to the length of `path`, with all elements initialized to 0. If the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is set to -inf.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is not 0; `dp` is a list of length equal to the length of `path`, with all elements initialized to 0; `dp[0]` is either 1 or -inf depending on the first character of `path`; `dp[1]` is -inf if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`
    #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is not 0; `dp` is a list of length equal to the length of `path`, with all elements initialized to 0; `dp[0]` is either 1 or -inf depending on the first character of `path`; `dp[1]` is -inf if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`.
    #
    #This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables `path` and `dp` after the execution of the if-else block. It covers both the if part and the absence of an else part, ensuring that all possible outcomes are accounted for based on the conditions and updates within the if statement.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: Output State: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is `n`; `dp` is a list of length `n`, with `dp[0]` being either 1 or -inf depending on the first character of `path`, `dp[1]` being -inf if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`, and for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is -inf if `path[i]` is '*', otherwise `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@', 0 otherwise.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value among the elements in the list `dp` that are greater than negative infinity.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `path`, which is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and returns either 0 or the maximum value among the elements in the list `dp` that are greater than negative infinity.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value among the elements in the list `dp` that are greater than negative infinity.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
