Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using spaces, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `data`, or `index`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
