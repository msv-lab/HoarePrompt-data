Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input data consisting of multiple lines. It first reads an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and then reads n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns nothing explicitly but processes the input data according to the given constraints.**

Note: The function does not accept any parameters directly in its definition but relies on external input data structured in a specific way.
