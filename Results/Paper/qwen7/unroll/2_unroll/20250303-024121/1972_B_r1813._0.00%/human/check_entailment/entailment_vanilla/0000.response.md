### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, correctly extracting `t`, `n`, and `s` for each test case.

2. **Counting Facing-Up Coins**:
   - The program counts the number of coins facing up (`num_up_coins = s.count('U')`) for each test case.
   
3. **Determining the Winner**:
   - The program checks if the number of facing-up coins is odd (`num_up_coins % 2 == 1`).
   - If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results, indicating Alice wins.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO', indicating Bob wins.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic in the program is sound and aligns with the problem statement. If there is an odd number of facing-up coins, Alice can always force a win because she can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, eventually leading to a situation where Bob has no valid moves left.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating through them and processing each one independently.
- The counting and conditional logic are implemented correctly without any errors.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
