Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the number of coins `n`, the string `s` representing the orientation of the coins, and counts the number of coins facing up (`num_up_coins`).
3. The logic to determine the winner is based on whether the count of 'U' (up-facing coins) is odd or even. This is a key part of the problem statement.
4. If the count of 'U' is odd, the program correctly outputs 'YES', indicating Alice will win.
5. If the count of 'U' is even, the program correctly outputs 'NO', indicating Bob will win.
6. The program processes all test cases as specified and prints the results in the required format.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the program appears to implement the logic correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
