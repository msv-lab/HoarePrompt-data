You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`. If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it prints each result in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described. Specifically, it fails to handle the removal and flipping of adjacent coins when a facing-up coin is chosen. Instead, it simply counts the number of coins facing up and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even. This approach is incorrect because it does not reflect the actual game mechanics.

For example, consider the test case `5 UUDUD`. According to the problem description, the game would proceed as follows:

1. Alice chooses the first coin 'U', removing it and flipping the adjacent coins 'U' and 'D'. The string becomes 'DDUU'.
2. Bob chooses the last coin 'U', removing it and flipping the adjacent coins 'D' and 'U'. The string becomes 'UDD'.
3. Alice chooses the first coin 'U', removing it and flipping the adjacent coins 'D' and 'D'. The string becomes 'UU'.
4. Bob chooses the first coin 'U', removing it and the game ends. Alice wins.

However, the program incorrectly counts the number of 'U' coins and determines that since the count is odd, Alice will win. This is not correct because the actual game mechanics involve removing and flipping adjacent coins, not just counting the number of 'U' coins.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game rules and thus is incorrect.
