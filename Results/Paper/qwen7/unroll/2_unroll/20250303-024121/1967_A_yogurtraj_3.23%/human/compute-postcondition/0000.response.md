Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for ii in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved here are `ii` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `ii` is a variable used in the loop, but its initial value is not specified. It will be incremented in each iteration.
   - The result of `int(input())` is the number of iterations the loop will run. This value is not known until the input is provided.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `ii` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `ii` starts from 0 and is incremented in each iteration, it will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.
   - The value of `int(input())` is not known until runtime, but we know it must be an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) based on the initial state given.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `ii` and the result of `int(input())`.

State: **`ii` is 0, the result of `int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive**
