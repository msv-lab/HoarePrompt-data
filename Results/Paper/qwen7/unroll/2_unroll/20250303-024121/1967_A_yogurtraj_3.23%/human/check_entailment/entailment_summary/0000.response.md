Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by redistributing the cards to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. However, upon closer inspection, the logic in the program does not correctly address the problem requirements. Specifically:

1. **Redistribution Logic**: The program tries to redistribute cards to achieve a uniform distribution up to a certain point and then applies any remaining redistribution points. This approach does not guarantee the maximum score because it doesn't consider all possible ways to distribute the cards optimally.

2. **Calculation of `r` and `rem`**: The calculation of `r` (the maximum value a card can have after redistribution) and `rem` (remaining redistribution points) is flawed. The logic for determining `r` and `rem` does not account for the need to create as many valid subarrays as possible.

3. **Final Calculation**: The final calculation of the result using `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` does not accurately reflect the number of valid subarrays that can be formed. It assumes a uniform distribution, which may not be optimal.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
