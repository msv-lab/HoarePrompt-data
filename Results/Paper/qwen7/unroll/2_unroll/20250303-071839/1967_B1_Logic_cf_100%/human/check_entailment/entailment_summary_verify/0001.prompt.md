You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on \( n \) and \( m \) using a specific formula: starting with \( ans = n \), it adds \( (n + b) // (b * b) \) for each \( b \) from 2 up to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \). The function then prints the result for each test case, outputting \( t \) lines of results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read from the input.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is a starting point but does not seem to account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of \(b\):**
   - The loop iterates over values of \(b\) from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
   - Inside the loop, `(n + b) // (b * b)` is added to `ans`. This expression does not correctly reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, which should be the count of valid pairs.

### Correctness Check
To check the correctness, let's compare the logic with the required condition:
- The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The program does not iterate over all possible values of \(a\) for each \(b\) and check the condition.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program using the example provided in the problem statement:

- For the test case \( (n, m) = (10, 8) \):
  - The expected output is 14.
  - The program calculates `ans` as `n` (which is 10) and then adds some values based on the incorrect logic.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

**Correctness: **False**
