### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the given program does not correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). Let's break down why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Logic:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is a starting point but does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop iterates over values of \(b\) from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, and inside the loop, `(n + b) // (b * b)` is added to `ans`. This expression does not reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Missing Iteration Over All Possible Values of \(a\):**
   - The program does not iterate over all possible values of \(a\) for each \(b\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it incorrectly assumes that adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\) will give the correct count of valid pairs.

3. **Example Verification:**
   - For the test case \((n, m) = (10, 8)\), the expected output is 14, but the program's logic does not produce the correct result.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
