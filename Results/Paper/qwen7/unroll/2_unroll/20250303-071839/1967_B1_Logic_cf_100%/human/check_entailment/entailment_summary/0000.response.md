Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `ans` to \( n \).
3. **Loop Calculation**: It then iterates through values of \( b \) from 2 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \). In each iteration, it updates `ans` by adding \( (n + b) // (b * b) \).

Now, let's compare this with the required conditions:
- The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The provided solution does not seem to directly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a different formula involving division and addition, which does not align with the problem statement.

Given the discrepancy between the required conditions and the implemented logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
