The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on \( n \) and \( m \) using a specific formula: starting with \( ans = n \), it adds \( (n + b) // (b * b) \) for each \( b \) from 2 up to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \). The function then prints the result for each test case, outputting \( t \) lines of results.
