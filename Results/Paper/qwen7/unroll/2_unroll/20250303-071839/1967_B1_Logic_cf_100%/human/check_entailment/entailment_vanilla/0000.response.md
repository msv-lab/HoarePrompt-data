Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read from the input.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is a starting point but does not seem to account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of \(b\):**
   - The loop iterates over values of \(b\) from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
   - Inside the loop, `(n + b) // (b * b)` is added to `ans`. This expression does not correctly reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, which should be the count of valid pairs.

### Correctness Check
To check the correctness, let's compare the logic with the required condition:
- The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The program does not iterate over all possible values of \(a\) for each \(b\) and check the condition.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program using the example provided in the problem statement:

- For the test case \( (n, m) = (10, 8) \):
  - The expected output is 14.
  - The program calculates `ans` as `n` (which is 10) and then adds some values based on the incorrect logic.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

**Correctness: **False**
