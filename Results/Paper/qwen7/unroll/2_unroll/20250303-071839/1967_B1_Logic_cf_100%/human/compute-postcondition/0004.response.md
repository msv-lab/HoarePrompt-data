Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, and m. For each test case, t indicates the number of subsequent pairs of integers (n, m) to process. The function verifies that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each pair (n, m), 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, ensuring the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.**

This functionality describes a function that iterates through multiple test cases, each containing a count `t` and multiple pairs of integers `(n, m)`, and checks if all provided values meet the specified constraints.
