Output State: The value of `t`, followed by `t` lines, each containing the sum of `n` plus the result of the inner loop calculation for each pair `(n, m)` provided in the input. Specifically, for each pair `(n, m)`, `ans` is calculated as `n` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for `b` ranging from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
