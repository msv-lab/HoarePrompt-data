Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input function will ensure that the value assigned to `t` is an integer, the output state reflects that `t` is now an input integer within the given range. The other conditions and constraints about `n` and `m` remain unchanged and are still valid.
