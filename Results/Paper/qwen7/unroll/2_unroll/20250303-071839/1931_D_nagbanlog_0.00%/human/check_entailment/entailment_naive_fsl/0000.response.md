Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` values, which do not align with the problem description. According to the problem, a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). However, the program uses modulo operations to determine these conditions, which is not correct.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input: \(n = 6\), \(x = 5\), \(y = 2\), \(a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]\)

The correct beautiful pairs should be:
- \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\): \(a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10\) (divisible by 5) and \(a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8\) (divisible by 2).
- \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\): \(a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10\) (divisible by 5) and \(a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2\) (divisible by 2).

However, the program incorrectly identifies these pairs because it uses modulo operations instead of directly checking the divisibility conditions. This leads to incorrect counts for beautiful pairs.

To fix this, the program should directly check if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\) without using modulo operations.
