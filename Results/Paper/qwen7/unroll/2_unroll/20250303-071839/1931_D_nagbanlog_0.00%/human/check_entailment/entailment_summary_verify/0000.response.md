### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` processes each test case by iterating through the array and using frequency counters to find pairs that satisfy the conditions for being beautiful.
2. **Modulo Operations**: The program uses modulo operations to transform the numbers and check for conditions. Specifically, it calculates:
   - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x`
   - `required_mod_y = mod_y`

These operations do not directly align with the problem's requirements. The problem requires direct checks for divisibility, not transformations via modulo operations.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the test case:
- \(n = 6\), \(x = 5\), \(y = 2\), \(a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]\)

The correct beautiful pairs are:
- \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\): \(a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10\) (divisible by 5) and \(a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8\) (divisible by 2).
- \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\): \(a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10\) (divisible by 5) and \(a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2\) (divisible by 2).

However, the program incorrectly identifies these pairs because it uses modulo operations instead of directly checking the conditions.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to directly check the conditions:
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        if (a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0 and (a[i] - a[j]) % y == 0:
            beautiful_count += 1
```

This approach ensures that we directly check the divisibility conditions without any unnecessary transformations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs due to the use of incorrect modulo operations. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
