Output State: `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case, where a beautiful pair `(num, a_i)` satisfies the condition that the number `num` can be transformed into `a_i` by performing a series of operations where each operation consists of either adding `x` or subtracting `y` modulo `x` and `y`. The `print` statements are informational and do not affect the final state of the `results` list.
