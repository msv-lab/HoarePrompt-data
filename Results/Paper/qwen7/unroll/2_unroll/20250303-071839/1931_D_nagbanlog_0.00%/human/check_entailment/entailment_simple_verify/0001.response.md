### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Function Definition and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly takes `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries containing test case parameters).
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Loop Through Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts `n`, `x`, and `y` from the dictionary.
   - It also extracts the array `a`.
   - It prints the parameters and the array for debugging purposes.

3. **Frequency Dictionary Initialization:**
   - A dictionary `freq` is correctly initialized to keep track of the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each element `num` in the array `a`:
     - Calculate `mod_x` and `mod_y` using `num % x` and `num % y`.
     - Calculate the required `mod_x` and `mod_y` values that would make the pair beautiful.
     - Check if the required `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pair exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, add the corresponding frequency to `beautiful_count`.
     - Update the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.

5. **Appending Results:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, correctly append the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

6. **Returning Results:**
   - Finally, correctly return the `results` list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Modulo Calculations:**
   - The modulo calculations are correct and necessary to determine if a pair is beautiful.
   - Specifically, `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y` are calculated correctly.
   - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` ensures that the sum `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
   - `required_mod_y = mod_y` ensures that the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

2. **Frequency Dictionary Usage:**
   - The frequency dictionary is used correctly to count the occurrences of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair, which helps in identifying the beautiful pairs efficiently.
   - This approach ensures that we can quickly find pairs that satisfy the conditions without having to check every possible pair explicitly.

3. **Pair Validation:**
   - The logic for validating the beautiful pairs is correct. It checks if the required `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pair exists in the frequency dictionary.
   - This ensures that we only count pairs that meet the criteria for being beautiful.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when a number itself forms a beautiful pair with another number (e.g., `a_i + a_j` and `a_i - a_j` both being zero).
   - For example, if `a_i` and `a_j` are such that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`, the program will correctly count this pair.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic for determining and counting beautiful pairs is correct. The program follows the problem description accurately and handles the required operations correctly.
