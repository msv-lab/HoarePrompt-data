Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers n, x, and y such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**
