Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. The loop variable `case` will take on the value of each tuple in `test_cases` during each iteration.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element (tuple). The loop variable `case` will be set to the first tuple in `test_cases` when the loop starts.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on `test_cases` having at least one tuple, we need to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one tuple. Additionally, the initial state of `case` will be the first tuple in `test_cases`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `test_cases` must have at least one tuple.
- The first tuple in `test_cases` will be assigned to `case` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the modified state is:

**State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, the first tuple in `test_cases` is assigned to `case`**.
