Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not implemented in the provided code snippet. This suggests that the implementation of `func_1()` is missing.

3. **Current Implementation:**
   - The current implementation of the main loop reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It then calls `func_1()` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1()` currently returns a string `s` which is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` sliced to the first `k` characters and repeated `n` times.

### Problem Analysis:

- **Objective:** Generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
- **Constraints:** `1 ≤ n ≤ 26` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 26`.

### Issues with Current Implementation:

1. **Incorrect Approach:**
   - The current approach simply repeats the first `k` lowercase letters `n` times. This does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters will be subsequences of `s`.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string generated would be `"abab"`. However, this does not contain all possible 2-letter combinations like "aa", "bb", etc.

2. **Lack of Functionality:**
   - The function `func_1()` is not implemented, so we cannot verify its correctness.

### Correct Solution Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to construct a string `s` that includes all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters. One efficient way to do this is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of length `n` appears exactly once.

### Conclusion:

Given the current implementation, it is clear that the program does not solve the problem as intended. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
