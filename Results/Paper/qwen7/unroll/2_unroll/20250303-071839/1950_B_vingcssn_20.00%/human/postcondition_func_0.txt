Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases defined by the variable `casos`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a specific pattern based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints two lines of `##`. If `n` is 2, it prints four lines with alternating `##..` and `..##`. If `n` is 3, it prints six lines with a combination of `##` and `..`. If `n` is 4, it prints eight lines with a specific pattern. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango' for that iteration. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
