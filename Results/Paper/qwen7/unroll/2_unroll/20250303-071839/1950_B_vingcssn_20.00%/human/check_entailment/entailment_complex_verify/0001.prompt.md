You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:

    #State: Output State: The output will consist of multiple patterns printed based on the value of `n` for each iteration of the loop. If `n` is 1, it will print two lines with `##`. If `n` is 2, it will print four lines with `##..` followed by four lines with `..##`. If `n` is 3, it will print six lines with various combinations of `##` and `..`. If `n` is 4, it will print eight lines with specific patterns. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it will print 'No esta en el rango' (which means 'Not in the range') for that iteration. The number of times each pattern is printed corresponds to the value of `casos`.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases defined by the variable `casos`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a specific pattern based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints two lines of `##`. If `n` is 2, it prints four lines with alternating `##..` and `..##`. If `n` is 3, it prints six lines with a combination of `##` and `..`. If `n` is 4, it prints eight lines with a specific pattern. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango' for that iteration. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The problem requires generating a 2n x 2n checkerboard where each 2x2 block alternates between `#` and `.`.
2. The given solution handles specific cases for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` but does not provide a general solution for any `n` greater than 4.
3. For `n > 4`, the function prints "No esta en el rango" which translates to "Not in the range" in English, but it should continue to generate the checkerboard pattern.
4. The pattern for `n > 4` can be derived from the patterns for smaller values of `n`. Each row and column can be extended by repeating the pattern from the previous rows and columns.
5. The given solution does not correctly handle the general case for `n > 4`.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not provide a general solution for generating the checkerboard for any value of `n` greater than 4. It should use a loop to generate the pattern dynamically rather than hardcoding each case.
