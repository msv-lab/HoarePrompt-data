### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Balance Calculation:**
   - The program correctly reads the input string `s` and iterates through each character.
   - It calculates the balance of the parentheses sequence by incrementing the balance for an opening parenthesis `(` and decrementing it for a closing parenthesis `)`.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Details List Construction:**
   - For each character, the program appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list.
   - Using `-i` ensures that when sorting by balance, characters with the same balance will be sorted in decreasing order of their original positions.
   - This part is also correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The `details` list is sorted based on the balance values in ascending order and positions in descending order.
   - Sorting by balance first ensures that the prefixes' balances are correctly ordered, and the secondary sorting by position ensures that sequences with the same balance are ordered from right to left in the original string.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem definition.

4. **Result Construction:**
   - The program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.
   - However, there is a subtle issue here. The `result` string is constructed using `char` from the tuple, but the `details` list is sorted based on the balance and position, which means the order of characters in the `result` string might not match the intended shuffled sequence. Specifically, the `details` list is sorted by balance and position, but the `result` string is constructed directly from the characters without considering the original positions.

5. **Output:**
   - The result string is printed, which should be the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.
   - Given the issue mentioned in the result construction step, the output may not be correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the `result` string is correctly constructed from the sorted `details` list. The program does not account for the original positions of the characters when constructing the result string, which could lead to incorrect outputs for certain input sequences.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
