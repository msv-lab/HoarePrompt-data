Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer representing the balance of the parentheses sequence. The balance is calculated as the difference between the number of opening parentheses '(' and the number of closing parentheses ')' in the given string.**

Note: The string `s` is a hidden input within the function, consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
