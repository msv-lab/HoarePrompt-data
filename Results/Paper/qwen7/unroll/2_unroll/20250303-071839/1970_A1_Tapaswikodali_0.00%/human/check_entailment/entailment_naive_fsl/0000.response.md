Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. Specifically, the sorting step is flawed. According to the problem description, the columns should be sorted in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of position. However, the program sorts the `details` list based on `(-i, balance)`, which does not correctly handle the tie-breaking condition.

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The expected output is `()(()())`, but the program will produce an incorrect result due to the flawed sorting logic. The correct implementation should ensure that the positions are sorted in decreasing order when the balances are equal, which is not achieved in the current code.
