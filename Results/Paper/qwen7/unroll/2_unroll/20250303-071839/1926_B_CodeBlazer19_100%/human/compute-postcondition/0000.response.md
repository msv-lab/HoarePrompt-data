Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and now t is set to the integer input value.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 remains valid, but now `t` is specifically set to the integer input value received from the user. All other preconditions and variables remain unchanged.
