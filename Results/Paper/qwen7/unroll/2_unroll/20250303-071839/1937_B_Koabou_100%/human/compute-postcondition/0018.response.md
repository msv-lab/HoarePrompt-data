Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]` of length `n`. It finds a substring `s` in the first string `a[0]` that matches a suffix of the second string `a[1]`, and calculates the length of this matching substring. The function then prints the substring `s` and the calculated length `t`, which is always 1 if no match is found.**
