Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list containing two elements, each element is an input value from the user; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an empty list; `x` is 0; `y` is 0.**

The code `y = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
