#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are provided, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list containing two elements, each element is an input value from the user; `n` is an input integer.
    #
    #This means after the loop executes, the list `a` will contain two input values provided by the user, while `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list containing two elements, each element is a string; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a string; `x` is an integer; `y` is an integer.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes, the variables `s` and `x` will be updated based on the conditions inside the loop. The variable `y` will be assigned the value of `i` if the first condition is met, and `x` will be assigned the value of `i` if the second condition is met and the `break` statement is executed. If neither condition is met for any `i` in the range, `s` will be set to the concatenation of `a[0]` and `a[1][n-1]`, and `x` will be set to `n-1`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 1, `a` is a list containing two elements, each element is a string, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the range from `y` to `x`. For each iteration, it checks if a substring of `a[1]` starting at index `i` and ending at index `x-1` is equal to a corresponding substring of `s` starting at index `i+1` and ending at index `x`. If a match is found, it sets `t` to the length of the matching substring (`x - i + 1`) and breaks out of the loop. Since the problem does not provide specific values for `x`, `y`, `a`, and `s`, we cannot determine the exact value of `t`. However, based on the given code, `t` will be set to some positive integer (or 1 if a match is found) or remain 1 if no match is found within the loop. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `s`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]` of length `n`. It finds a substring `s` in the first string `a[0]` that matches a suffix of the second string `a[1]`, and calculates the length of this matching substring. The function then prints the substring `s` and the calculated length `t`, which is always 1 if no match is found.
