You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5; a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and always returns 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to ensure that Vlad can conduct `m` rounds with at least one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - If there are not enough problems of a certain difficulty level, we need to calculate how many additional problems are required.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems in the bank) and `m` (number of rounds).

3. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level.
   - This part is correct and ensures that we have the correct counts of each difficulty level.

4. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - The program initializes the counts for each difficulty level to 0.
   - It iterates through the input string and updates the counts.
   - For each difficulty level, it calculates the number of additional problems needed using the formula `m - d[val]` if `d[val]` is less than `m`.
   - The total number of additional problems needed is stored in `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where the number of problems in the bank is sufficient for all rounds without needing any additional problems.
   - It also handles cases where some difficulty levels are missing and calculates the exact number of additional problems needed.

7. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is unused and does not affect the main logic of the program.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
