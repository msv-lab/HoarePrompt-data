Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `lex` into a valid 3-letter word. However, the logic in the for loop is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for assigning values to `arr` are not comprehensive enough to cover all possible values of `lex`.
   - The current logic only handles cases where `lex` is less than 28, 52, or 78. It does not handle cases where `lex` is greater than 78, which means it cannot correctly decode all possible values of `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).

3. **Sorting and Construction**:
   - After incorrectly decoding `lex`, the program sorts the array `arr`. Sorting is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results if the initial decoding was wrong.
   - The program then constructs the word using the sorted values, which might not give the lexicographically smallest word if the initial decoding was incorrect.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case. However, due to the flawed decoding process, the output may not be the lexicographically smallest word for some test cases.

Given these points, the program does not correctly decode the integer `n` into the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
