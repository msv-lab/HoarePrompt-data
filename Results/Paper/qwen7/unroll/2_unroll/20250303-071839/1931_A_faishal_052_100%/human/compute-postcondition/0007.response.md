Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an error message if t is not within the range of 1 to 100 or if n is not within the range of 3 to 78.**

Given the constraints and the provided output cases, it appears there might be a misunderstanding since the function definition does not include any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, the function should check if `t` and `n` fall within specified ranges. However, since the function definition does not include these parameters, the function can only return an error message if such parameters were to be passed, which is not the case here.

If the intention was to describe a function that checks the validity of `t` and `n` based on given constraints, the function signature would need to include these parameters.
