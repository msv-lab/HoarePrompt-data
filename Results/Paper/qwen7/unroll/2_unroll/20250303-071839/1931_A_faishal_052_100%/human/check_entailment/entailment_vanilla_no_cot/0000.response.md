Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly decode the encoded integers into the lexicographically smallest three-letter words. Let's break down why it is incorrect and provide a corrected version.

#### Issues with the Provided Solution:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Decoding:**
   - The logic to decode the integer back to the lexicographically smallest word is flawed.
   - It incorrectly handles the distribution of the sum across the three letters.

2. **Sorting and Appending:**
   - The sorting and appending logic does not ensure the lexicographically smallest combination of letters.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the sum can be split into smaller valid letter values.

#### Corrected Solution:
To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to start with the smallest possible value for the first letter and then distribute the remaining sum among the second and third letters.

Hereâ€™s the corrected implementation:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex_sum = int(input())
        # Find the largest possible value for the first letter
        for first_letter in range(1, 27):
            remaining_sum = lex_sum - first_letter
            # Check if the remaining sum can be distributed between the second and third letters
            if remaining_sum >= 2 and remaining_sum <= 50:
                second_letter = min(remaining_sum - 1, 26)
                third_letter = remaining_sum - second_letter
                if third_letter <= 26:
                    result = chr(first_letter + 96) + chr(second_letter + 96) + chr(third_letter + 96)
                    print(result)
                    break

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Iterate Over Possible Values for the First Letter:**
   - We start with the smallest possible value for the first letter (1) and incrementally check larger values up to 26.

2. **Calculate Remaining Sum:**
   - Subtract the current first letter value from the total sum to get the remaining sum.

3. **Distribute Remaining Sum:**
   - Ensure the remaining sum can be split into two valid letters (between 1 and 26).

4. **Form the Resulting Word:**
   - Convert the values back to characters using `chr(letter + 96)` and form the resulting word.

This approach ensures that we find the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.
