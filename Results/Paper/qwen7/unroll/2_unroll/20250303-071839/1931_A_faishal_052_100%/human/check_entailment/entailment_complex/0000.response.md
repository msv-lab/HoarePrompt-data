Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and processes each test case by reading an integer `lex` which represents the encoded value.

2. **Processing the Encoded Value**:
   - The program attempts to process the value of `lex` based on certain conditions:
     - If `lex < 28`, it appends `1` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `28 <= lex < 52`, it appends `26` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - If `52 <= lex <= 78`, it appends `26` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - It then appends the remaining value of `lex` to the list `arr`.

3. **Sorting and Conversion**:
   - The list `arr` is sorted.
   - The first three elements of `arr` are converted to their corresponding lowercase letters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` and concatenated to form the final word.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

However, there are some issues with the logic in the processing part:
- The conditions for appending `1` and `26` do not cover all possible values of `lex` accurately. Specifically, the conditions should be more granular to ensure all possible values of `lex` are handled correctly.
- The sorting and conversion steps seem to be unnecessary and might not produce the correct result for all cases.

To fix the logic, we need to correctly determine the letters corresponding to the encoded value without sorting. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        word = ['a', 'a', 'a']
        if lex >= 27:
            word[2] = chr((lex - 1) % 26 + 97)
            lex -= (lex - 1) % 26 + 1
        if lex >= 26:
            word[1] = chr((lex - 1) % 26 + 97)
            lex -= (lex - 1) % 26 + 1
        if lex >= 1:
            word[0] = chr(lex + 96)
        print(''.join(word))
```

With this corrected logic, the program will correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

Given the original logic and the provided example, the original program does not handle all cases correctly and produces incorrect results. Therefore, the original program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
