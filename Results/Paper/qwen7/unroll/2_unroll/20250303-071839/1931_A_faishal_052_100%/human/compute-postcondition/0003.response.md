Output State: `info` is a list containing up to 100 lists. Each inner list contains four elements: two integers between 1 and 26 inclusive, followed by an integer between 0 and 26 inclusive, with the entire list sorted in ascending order. The first two integers represent the number of times 1 or 26 was appended to the list based on the value of `lex`, and the last integer represents the remaining value of `lex` after the loop.
