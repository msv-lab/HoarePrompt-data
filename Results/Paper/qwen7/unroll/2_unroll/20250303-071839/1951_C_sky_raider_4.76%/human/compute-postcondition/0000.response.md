Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `0` because `range(int(input()))` generates a sequence starting from `0`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` is the input that determines how many times the loop will run, we need to ensure that `t` is correctly set before the loop starts.

Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that the loop will run exactly `t` times. Therefore, the value of `i` should be adjusted to start the loop correctly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0**
