Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including an integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case includes integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns different outputs based on the conditions provided for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing and return values are not detailed here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without delving into the operational details.
