Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) exceeds the product of the number of days (`n`) and the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`). In such cases, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum spending.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 10 11
1 2 3 4 5
```
- `n = 5`, `m = 10`, `k = 11`
- The prices per ticket for each day are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

According to the problem description, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought is `n * m = 50`. Since `k = 11` is less than `50`, this case should be handled correctly. However, the program sorts the list of prices and then iterates through the days, buying up to `m` tickets each day and adjusting the remaining tickets accordingly. This approach fails to account for the fact that the price increases after purchasing tickets, which could potentially lead to a lower total cost if tickets are purchased strategically.

To illustrate the issue, let's manually calculate the minimum spending for the above example:
- On day 1, buy 1 ticket for 1 unit.
- On day 2, buy 1 ticket for 2 units.
- On day 3, buy 1 ticket for 3 units.
- On day 4, buy 1 ticket for 4 units.
- On day 5, buy 1 ticket for 5 units.
- On day 2 again, buy 1 ticket for 2 units (price increased by 1).
- On day 3 again, buy 1 ticket for 3 units (price increased by 2).
- On day 4 again, buy 1 ticket for 4 units (price increased by 3).
- On day 5 again, buy 1 ticket for 5 units (price increased by 4).

Total cost: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 31`.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as:
- Buy 10 tickets on day 1 for `10 * 1 = 10` units.
- Buy 1 ticket on day 2 for `1 * 10 = 10` units.
- Total cost: `10 + 10 = 20`.

This shows that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets exceeds the product of the number of days and the maximum tickets per day, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
