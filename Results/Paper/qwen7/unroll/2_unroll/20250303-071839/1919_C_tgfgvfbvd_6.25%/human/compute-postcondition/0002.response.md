Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. After executing the loop, the variable c is an integer representing the count of elements in the list that satisfy the condition specified in the loop.
