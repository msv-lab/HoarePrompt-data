Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty as defined in the problem statement. The program attempts to count the number of increasing pairs in a specific manner but does not correctly split the array into two subsequences to minimize the total penalty. The logic inside the loops is flawed and does not ensure that the array is optimally split into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\).

To solve this problem correctly, one should sort the array and then split it into two parts at a point that minimizes the penalty. The penalty can be calculated by counting the number of inversions in each part of the split array. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        l.sort()
        
        # Initialize penalties for both subsequences
        penalty_s = 0
        penalty_t = 0
        
        # Calculate penalties for the two subsequences
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if l[i] < l[i + 1]:
                penalty_s += 1
            else:
                penalty_t += 1
        
        # The minimum penalty is the sum of penalties of the two subsequences
        print(penalty_s + penalty_t)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version sorts the array and calculates the penalties for the two subsequences directly, ensuring that the total penalty is minimized.
