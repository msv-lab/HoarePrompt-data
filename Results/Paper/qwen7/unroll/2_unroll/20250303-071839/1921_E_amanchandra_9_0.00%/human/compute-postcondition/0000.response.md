Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < int(input())`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is greater than 0.

4. **Initial State of `int(input())`**: The initial state of `int(input())` is unknown because it depends on user input. However, it is guaranteed that `t` (which is equivalent to `int(input())`) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

5. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop depends on the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that this value is within the specified range and greater than 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `int(input())` should be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive**.
