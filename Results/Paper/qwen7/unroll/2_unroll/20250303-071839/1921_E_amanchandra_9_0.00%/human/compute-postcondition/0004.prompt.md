You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of six positive integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b such that 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b, and the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
        
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <=
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. The number of lines will be equal to the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the output depends on the relative positions of the points (xa, ya) and (xb, yb) within the grid defined by dimensions h and w. If xa is greater than xb, the output is 'Draw'. Otherwise, it checks the vertical positions and determines if Alice or Bob wins based on their positions relative to the midpoint between xa and xb.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes six positive integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. These integers satisfy specific conditions: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The function returns a value based on the given integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
