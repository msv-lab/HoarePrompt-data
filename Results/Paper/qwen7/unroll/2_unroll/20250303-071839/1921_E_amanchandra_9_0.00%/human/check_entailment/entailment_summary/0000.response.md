Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies the base condition where if Alice's row position `xa` is greater than Bob's row position `xb`, it prints 'Draw'. This is correct because if Alice is already below Bob, Alice cannot capture Bob's chip since Bob can only move upwards.
2. The program then calculates the midpoint `x` between `xa` and `xb`. This midpoint calculation is used to determine the range of valid moves for both players.
3. For the case where the difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, the program calculates the left (`l`) and right (`r`) bounds for Alice's possible moves. It then checks if Alice's current column position `ya` falls within a certain range relative to Bob's column position `yb`.
4. Similarly, for the case where the difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, the program calculates the left (`l`) and right (`r`) bounds for Bob's possible moves and checks if Bob's current column position `yb` falls within a certain range relative to Alice's column position `ya`.

Given the detailed logic and the way the program handles different scenarios, it appears to correctly implement the rules of the game and determine the outcome based on optimal play.

Correctness: **True**
