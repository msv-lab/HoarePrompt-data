Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Path Calculation:**
   - The logic to find the lexicographically smallest path is flawed. The current implementation tries to find a specific pattern where the first row has '1' and the second row has '0', which is not always the optimal strategy.
   - The solution should consider all possible paths from the top-left to the bottom-right while ensuring the resulting string is lexicographically minimal.

2. **Handling All Paths:**
   - The solution only considers one potential path and does not explore all possible paths to ensure the lexicographically smallest string is found.
   - It also does not correctly count the number of such paths.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
- Use dynamic programming to keep track of the lexicographically smallest path.
- Count the number of ways to achieve this path.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = [input() for _ in range(2)]
    
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[defaultdict(int) for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(3)]
    dp[0][0][''] = 1
    
    # Fill DP table
    for i in range(2):
        for j in range(n):
            for prev, count in dp[i][j].items():
                if a[i][j] == '0':
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1][prev + '0'] += count
                if a[i][j] == '1':
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1][prev + '1'] += count
                if j > 0:
                    dp[i + 1][j][prev + '0'] += count
    
    # Find the lexicographically smallest path
    min_path = ''
    for path, count in dp[2][n].items():
        if path < min_path or min_path == '':
            min_path = path
    
    # Output the result
    print(min_path)
    print(dp[2][n][min_path])

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to explore all possible paths and keeps track of the lexicographically smallest path and its count.
