Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings `a_1` and `a_2` of length `n`. For each test case, it compares parts of the binary strings and constructs a new string `s` based on specific conditions. If a certain pattern is found, it calculates a value `t` indicating the length of a matching segment. Finally, it prints the constructed string `s` and the calculated value `t`.**
